<p>Special Thanks from Keith: Thanks to Jennifer Ellis for her endless inspiration, and to Jeremy Crawford, Christopher Perkins, Bill Slavicsek, James Wyatt, and the many others who made Eberron the world it is today.</p>
<p>Special Thanks from Wayne: Thanks to all the friends and fans, your enthusiasm along this journey was scintillating! Thank you, most of all, to Abigail, Gabriel, and Joanne, patiently waiting for their father and husband to return from the depths of Eberron.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Linear time is an illusion. This book, published in the Unseen Citadel of Xoriat, contains secrets that weren’t meant to be revealed for centuries. By reading it now, you are shifting the focus of the maze of reality and destroying the world that could have been. That future is a banana that will now remain unpeeled.</p>

<h4>ON THE COVER</h4>
    <p>With the aid of Droaam&apos;s enigmatic Daughters of Sora Kell, the bold adventurers known as the Badgers have opened a portal to Dal Quor—an achievement long thought to be impossible. Can the artificer Dela d’Cannith master the dream-lost Orb of Dol Azur before her comrades are overwhelmed by du’ulora and tsucora quori? This scene is brought to life by Thomas Bourdon.</p>
