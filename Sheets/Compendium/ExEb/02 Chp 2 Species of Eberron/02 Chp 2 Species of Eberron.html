    <p>Dela ran her fingers over the marble features of the statue, a small bust of an elven woman. “She’s still alive? Trapped in there?”</p>
    <p>“You speak as if that’s a punishment.” The priest’s features were hidden by his golden mask, his voice calm and steady. “Our lives are filled with chaos, battling disease, searching for sustenance. And what for? When we die, all that we are is consumed by Dolurrh. Instead, she is free—from fear, from hunger, from pain. She is eternal.”</p>
    <p>“What good’s eternity trapped in stone?”</p>
    <p>“She lives in a world of her own creation,” the priest said. “An endless trance—not unlike your dreaming, but she shapes the form of it. She may be walking through her perfect garden or reading her favorite book. She has access to all the memories of her time in her body. And that’s why life is so important; it is where we gather the knowledge and memories we will use to build our eternity.”</p>
    <p>Dela looked at the hundreds of stone faces lining the shelves. Each one the vessel of an elf soul, countless generations of the Jhaelian line. “So which one wanted to talk to me?”</p></aside>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="ChangelingsEmbracingChange">Changelings: Embracing Change</h2>
  <p><em>“I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. None will know them. They will have no kingdom but the road, and no enemy will find them. They may be shunned by all, but they will never be destroyed.”</em></p>
  <p>These are said to be the words of the Traveler, a promise that was made to the first changelings bestowed with the gift of shape-shifting. Many changelings still live according to these principles—wandering clans that remain hidden from the world. But there are an ever-increasing number of changelings who chose to live in the open. As a Changeling adventurer, you may use your gifts to fool your enemies—but do you show your true face to your companions?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ChangelingOrigins">Changeling Origins</h3>

  <p>Changelings are spread across Khorvaire and Sarlona. They can interbreed with many other humanoid species, and the offspring of such a union will either be changeling or the other species—there are no “half-changelings.” So just as you can be a Brelish elf with no ties to Aerenal, you can be a changeling with no connection to any changeling culture or community. There are changeling students in Arcanix and Morgrave, changeling agents in the King’s Citadel and the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and any number of changelings devoted to the nations they call home. So you don’t need deep cultural ties to play a changeling character, but if you want to explore a connection to your changeling roots, here are a few ideas.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Travelers">Travelers</h4>

  <p>Nomadic changelings are often referred to as “travelers,” a name referencing both their wandering lifestyle as well as the Traveler of the Dark Six—who, legend holds, gave them the ability to change their form, and whose chaotic nature is echoed in the lives of many travelers today.</p>
  <p>The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups—a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.</p>
  <p>Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to “obtain” another’s possessions as long as they’re replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler’s blessing is their license to prey on the “single-skins”—a term for species lacking the changeling gift for shape-shifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people—whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid—though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shape-shifting abilities and nomadic preferences.</p>
  <p>As a player character, the <a href="">Changeling Traveler background</a> can allow you to be part of a secretive network of changelings spread across the nation. As a DM, you could present the Children as a stereotypical source of thieves and charlatans. But they could be more enigmatic—an unexpected ally that can appear almost anywhere.</p>

  <aside id="" class="text--rules-sidebar">
  <p>Shiftweave</p>
  <p>The finest [magicitems]Glamerweave[/magicitems] is produced by the gnomes of Zilargo and the mage-tailors of Aundair. But [magicitems]Shiftweave[/magicitems] was first made by the Children of Jes, and today the finest transmuter-tailors are found among the traveler clans and the settled changeling communities. <em>Shiftweave</em> is a Common magic item that can shift between up to five embedded patterns. While this is an especially useful tool for the traveler who has a different persona for each town, it’s just as valuable for an agent of the King’s Citadel or an entertainer who’s shifting from a session at a common tavern to clothes suitable to perform at a palace. Basic <em>Shiftweave</em> can be purchased from House Cannith, but if you want the finest quality and the smoothest transformation, you should find a tailor in Dragoneyes or Blackleaf.</p>
  </aside>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="StableChangelings">Stable Changelings</h4>

  <p>Under the rule of Galifar, many changelings chose to emerge from the shadows and live in the open, and today they can be found in most major cities of the Five Nations. Changelings in stable communities—such as Dragoneyes in Sharn or the Blackleaf district of Wroat—rarely hide their true nature. This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the “Changeling Careers” sidebar. However, many still make use of shared personas, and outsiders can be confused by the changelings’ fluid relationship with identity. Stable changelings don’t face the same level of prejudice as travelers, but there are still many single-skins who believe no changeling can be trusted.</p>
  <p>In addition to changeling neighborhoods in the cities of the Five Nations, there are two unique changeling cultures. The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shape-shifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost. However, no outsider knows the location of Lost, and it’s said that the city itself is alive, and can freely move and change its shape. Regardless, the changelings of Lost have been strong allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and changelings can be found serving Daask.</p>
  <p>As a player character, a stable background gives you a place to call home and allows you to be open about your true nature. As a DM, a changeling community can be an interesting backdrop for an adventure or an easy place to find changeling services.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Passers">Passers</h4>

  <p>While changelings are well represented in the major cities, there are many villages and towns where they’re treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a passer, you’ve crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You may live your entire life as a human warrior or an elf priest, engaging your shape-shifting abilities only as a last resort.</p>
  <p>If you grew up as a passer, how do you live today? Do you want to learn more about other changeling cultures, or do you deny any connection to other changelings? Do you acknowledge your changeling nature, or do you consider your passer identity to be your true self? Do you pretend that your changeling abilities come from another source—claiming that your nonmagical cap is a [magicitems]Hat of Disguise[/magicitems] or pretending that you’re casting [spells]Disguise Self[/spells] when you shape-shift?</p>
  <p>Passer can be an interesting choice for a Wayfinder, Hermit, or a changeling who’s lived through oppression and is only now coming to understand their true nature. With NPCs, passers can add an element of chaos—if a slain villain is revealed as a changeling, did they use a body double and escape, or was the villain always a passer?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Others">Others</h4>

  <p>Changelings are as diverse as any other species, presenting many other cultures and paths you could explore. <em>Reality seekers</em> are stable changelings who prefer their natural form and avoid deception, instead searching for the ultimate truth. <em>Becomers</em> actively seek to live many lives in order to more fully understand the experiences of others. The Cabinet of Faces is a secret society devoted to the Traveler, and its members actively seek to challenge traditions and cause chaos. Do you have ties to any of these movements?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="PlayingAChangelingTraveler">Playing a Changeling Traveler</h4>

  <p>Chapter 6 provides the <a href="">Changeling Traveler background</a>. If you take this background, your character is part of a traveling clan of changelings. You spent your childhood traveling with your family, using your abilities to evade your enemies. Your family is part of a wider network of clans, and you can take advantage of the havens, traditions, and personas your people have sowed across the lands.</p>
  <p>As a traveler, you’re most comfortable on the move and dislike staying in any one place for too long. Your people’s traditions predate the laws of Galifar, and you have little attachment to any concept of nation or property; your first loyalty is to your family and your friends. Some travelers ignore the laws of the Five Nations, or even see tricking single-skins as a sport and enjoy defying them. However, most respect the people around them; if they acquire an item from a single-skin, they’ll compensate with something of equal value. Some sow chaos in the name of the Traveler, while others seek to understand people and serve as a bridge between cultures. If you’re playing a Changeling Traveler, which path do you follow?</p>
  <p>Traveler clans use well-established personas to secure shelter and information wherever they go. This could be a priest who will receive sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. When you’re approaching a new community, work with the DM to determine if there could be a persona with roots in that place; as long as you play that role, you can usually obtain Modest food and lodging and gain access to local gossip. In addition, when you encounter other members of your clan, you can ask them for help or information, provided this doesn’t place them at risk. However, this is a two-way street; if another member of your clan approaches you with a reasonable request, you’re expected to provide assistance.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fledgling Persona.</em></strong> Personas are important tools for traveler clans. Every clan has a set of shared personas, identities that have an established role in a particular region. But these personas need to be refreshed over time, and it’s your duty to develop a new persona that can be useful to the clan. Over the course of your adventuring career, you’re expected to establish useful connections and build a positive reputation for this identity. When you create a Changeling Traveler, work with your DM to establish a Persona that is your unique creation. You can roll on the Personas table or develop another concept with your DM, then add details to develop them into a unique identity.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Skin Cant.</em></strong> As a Changeling Traveler, you learn a secret language that allows you to silently convey messages to fellow changelings. This is a rare language that can only be “spoken” by shapechangers, though other creatures can learn to understand it. Skin Cant uses shifting patterns of scars, tattoos, and pigment. This allows you to convey a short message—a concept that can be expressed in six words or less—to anyone who knows the language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image, you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, “I need help” or “Everything I say is a lie.”</p>
  <p>You can also use this language to have a conversation—typically by manifesting symbols on the palm of your hand—with someone who is within 60 feet and able to see you. The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a Charisma ([skill]Deception[/skill]) check opposed by the observer’s Wisdom ([skill]Perception[/skill] or [skill]Insight[/skill]) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting patterns, though they don’t understand the meaning unless they also know Skin Cant.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Suggested Characteristics.</em></strong> While Changeling Travelers can be tricksters and agents of chaos, others strive to support strangers and have a positive influence wherever they go. Are you a charming scoundrel, a devotee of the Traveler, or just trying to stay out of trouble?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Personas">Personas</h3>

  <p>For a changeling, an identity is like a set of clothes. Within a changeling community, a persona may serve the same role a badge of office or uniform would for a human. The local priest is Father Hes. The sheriff is Big Dol. The healer is Lela. Whoever takes on the job assumes that persona. There may be three different priests, but whoever is currently on duty assumes the identity of Hes. In part, this is visual, but it’s also about adopting a personality—not just looking like Father Hes, but becoming Father Hes, giving the people a sense of continuity.</p>
  <p>This is especially important for the traveling clans. Travelers use well-established personas as anchors in potentially hostile communities. A trusted merchant, a beloved storyteller, or a reliable mercenary—any traveler can use one of these established personas to ensure a warm welcome. Of course, when using an established persona, it’s up to you to preserve its reputation. If you’re exposed as a changeling or if you ruin the reputation of the persona, you’re destroying a valuable tool.</p>
  <p>Many changelings develop their own unique personas. If you’re a Fighter with proficiency in the violin, you might use a grim half-orc form in combat and an elegant elf when you play the violin. You’re not required to use a persona—the violinist could fight in their elf form—but the persona can serve as a way to focus on that particular skill. The <a href="">Focused Personas feat</a> in chapter 6 provides a concrete reflection of this.</p>

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="ChangelingCareersPeople">
    <p>Changeling Careers</p>
    <p>People often think of the shape-shifting talents of the changeling as a tool for deception. But in places where changelings live openly, including Droaam and the major cities of the Five Nations, there are many practical uses for shape-shifting. Changelings have long dominated the industry of paid companionship, using their talents to fulfill fantasies. While this can be sexual, there are many other changeling companions who specialize in giving a client the opportunity to have a meal or conversation with a distant loved one, or to practice a difficult conversation with a changeling stand-in. Many artists use changelings as versatile models. Changelings can also often be found as beauticians; in addition to possessing a deep understanding of the shifting nature of appearance, a changeling can use their own form as a palette on which to perfect the look a client is aiming for.</p>
    <p>Impersonation is also a viable career. Do you need to be in two places at once? Do you want a local celebrity to appear at your child’s birthday party? Hire a changeling impersonator. The Defender’s Guild of House Deneith has recently begun training and licensing elite changeling bodyguards, capable of serving as body doubles or posing as harmless bystanders until needed.</p>
    <p>Many changelings pursue a career in entertainment. After all, a changeling with the proper [magicitems]Shiftweave[/magicitems] outfit can play five roles! However, House Thuranni and House Phiarlan have been accused of denying opportunities to changelings. In licensed Phiarlan companies, changelings are typically relegated to serving as understudies and stunt doubles for dragonmarked superstars.</p>

  <p>You could create a character of any class and background who just happens to be a changeling—or you can create a character whose concept is integrally tied to your identity as a changeling. Chapter 6 presents the Changeling Traveler background, three feats for the Changeling species, and the Living Weapon subclass for Monks that blends shape-shifting with martial discipline. However, you can have an equally interesting story with a character of any background or class, instead adjusting the “fluff”—the cosmetic details or backstory of a class—to fit an idea. While the following ideas don’t require any modification to the mechanical rules of a class, it’s always a good idea to discuss any exotic concept with your DM to make sure it fits the campaign.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheAberrantSorcerer">The Aberrant Sorcerer</h4>

  <p>An aberrant dragonmark grants dangerous power. What if you found a way to use your natural powers to transform your mark—and in so doing, to change the powers it grants you? The <a href="">Wild Magic Sorcerer subclass</a> could reflect the idea that you’re not entirely in control of your abilities, still learning what you can do and how to control it. Acquiring new spells might reflect your ability to reshape your mark into new configurations.</p>
  <p>Such an ability would be unprecedented—dragonmarks resist any effort at modification or replication. If you can alter your aberrant mark’s form, could you one day replicate the powers of a true mark? Does this gift mean that you have a special role to play in the Draconic Prophecy, or could your powers be part of an experiment tied to the daelkyr or a group of rogue dragons? Whatever the truth, you’ll surely be of interest to the dragonmarked houses and House Tarkanan.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheChangelingChangeling">The Changeling Changeling</h4>

  <p>In many places, it’s possible to pass between Eberron and Thelanis, and countless stories are told of children stolen away by the fey. As a child, perhaps you wandered through such a portal, finding yourself in the Faerie Court. After a decade in Thelanis, you’ve returned as an agent of one of the mighty archfey... a changeling changeling.</p>
  <p>This is a logical path for a Warlock with an Archfey Patron, and could also work with a Bard (likely following the College of Glamour). Your powers reflect both the gifts of your patron and tricks you learned growing up in Thelanis. The archfey isn’t just your patron, they’re your surrogate family. Have you returned with a specific mission to fulfill? Or are you just reacclimatizing to the world and waiting for your purpose to be revealed?</p>
  <p>As a changeling changeling, you’re an outsider, used to living in a world of fairytale logic and still learning how the world works. The Guide background is one option, reflecting a childhood spent roaming the trackless forests of Thelanis. The Hermit background is another logical choice; a revelation could have been shared with you by your patron. Another path would be to say that you returned to the Material Plane some time ago—perhaps you’ve earned a reputation as an Entertainer by playing the music of the Feywild.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheFraud">The Fraud</h4>

  <p>You’ve taken the <a href="">Noble background</a>. You’re the proud scion of a noble family... except you’re not. You’re a changeling body double hired by a young noble to take their place, and they never returned to take it back. It’s not a bad life, you take your responsibilities seriously, and you’re good at it—far better than the person you replaced. But you’re not who you appear to be. How does this impact your career as an adventurer? Did you know your fellow adventurers before you became a noble fraud? Do you have an entirely separate persona you use while adventuring, or are you adventuring in the guise of the noble?</p>
  <p>While the Noble is a sound choice for this story, many other backgrounds could work as well. You were the understudy for a famous entertainer who died in a mysterious accident; now you’re sought by popular demand, but your fame is based on someone else’s face and talent. Or as a Charlatan, you could be a spy’s contact now forced to complete their mission. Any class could work with this story—regardless, you’ve taken on someone else’s identity and this comes both with benefits and grave responsibilities.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheMenagerie">The Menagerie</h4>

  <p>As a Changeling, you can assume the shape of any Humanoid. What if you discovered that this was just a fraction of what you were capable of—that you could assume animal forms as well? As a Circle of the Moon Druid, you could assert that your spells and shape-changing powers don’t reflect a bond to nature, but rather an evolution of your natural abilities. Spells such as [spells]Longstrider[/spells], [sense]Darkvision[/sense], and [spells]Barkskin[/spells] could all be explained as evolved [rules]shape-shifting[/rules], while [spells]Charm Person[/spells] or [spells]Hold Person[/spells] could reflect psychic talents.</p>
  <p>If you want to play up this idea of having druidic powers with no ties to druidic traditions, you could talk to your DM about replacing the Druidic language feature. If you take the Criminal background, the DM might allow you to replace it with Thieves’ Cant; another option would be Skin Cant, described in the Changeling Traveler background. If neither of these fit, you could likely exchange it for another uncommon language.</p>
  <p>Like the aberrant sorcerer, a changeling menagerie possesses an unusual talent. As you gain levels, you’re unlocking more gifts. Are you intrigued by this mystery and what you could become? Or is your shape-shifting simply a useful tool for you?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ThePantheist">The Pantheist</h4>

  <p>The wandering priest is an easy role for the changeling traveler; pick a faith you know will receive a warm welcome in your town, preach a sermon for your supper, and move on in the morning. If you started on this path, you could have a [magicitems]Shiftweave[/magicitems] garment with vestments for the Host, the Flame, and the Blood of Vol, all ready to go. But while you may have started as a charlatan, something odd happened—you found faith. You trust that the Sovereigns are watching over you; you believe that the Silver Flame strengthens champions of the light; when you adopt an elf form, you even feel a surge of devotion for the Undying Court. When you adopt the trappings of a faith, you feel a connection to it. You’ve had visions tied to every faith, and the magic flows through you. As far as you’re concerned, all the faiths are real; it’s just about picking the right faith for the job.</p>
  <p>The simplest way to approach this concept is to pick a fairly general domain—such as Life—and to make your transformations largely cosmetic, a foundation for roleplaying. When you expect to be going into battle, shift your trappings to Dol Dorn. Fighting lycanthropes? Turn to the Silver Flame. About to speak to the dead? Time to call on the Blood of Vol. In taking on all these faiths, you are deeply empathetic, you accept all beliefs as valid, and you seek to help people of different faiths understand one another. Another possibility, if your DM likes the idea, is that you can receive divine visions based on the faith you’re currently embodying. Adopting Onatar’s trappings won’t give you the mechanical benefits of the Forge domain, but you may receive a vision from the Sovereign. Again, this is purely a story idea—and it’s always possible that your divine visions are just deep-rooted delusions!</p>

    <aside id="CasualShapeShifting" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>Casual Shape-shifting</p>
    <p>As a Changeling, consider that your ability to shape-shift is a natural reflex for you. It doesn’t have to be used for impersonation or deception. You can change your hair color or style on a whim, shift your eye color to suit your mood, even create artistic patterns on your skin. When you make a face to express an emotion, it can be any face. Are you making a rude gesture? Well, what sort of hand do you want to use to do it? Shape-shifting gives you many creative opportunities; don’t be afraid to use them!</p>
    </aside>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="ElvesOfAerenalTheDeathlessKingdom">Elves of Aerenal:<br /> The Deathless Kingdom</h2>
  <p>As one of the Aereni, you walk a different path than the people of Khorvaire. You were born in a realm guarded and guided by ancient and powerful spirits. You have learned lessons from teachers whose bodies died thousands of years ago, and you know that even the centuries of life that may lie ahead of you are just the beginning of your soul’s journey. Your people possess arcane knowledge beyond the grasp of Aundair; the priests of the Undying Court wield powers matched only by the Keeper of the Flame. You are from a land of wonders, a realm literally guided by divine forces. In short, your people have already achieved perfection. As an Aereni elf, you aren’t expected to improve your society; your task is to prove yourself worthy of it and to earn your afterlife.</p>
  <p>Aereni elves have a reputation for being arrogant and condescending. Why wouldn’t you be? Humans are like children to you, with their short lives and desperation to do things quickly regardless of the quality of their efforts. Even the elves that settled in Khorvaire have abandoned the traditions of their ancestors and their blessed homeland. It’s easy to be smug... but who wants that character around? An Aereni elf doesn’t have to be unpleasant. As one of the Aereni, you are a traveler from a mysterious and magical kingdom. You possess ancient wisdom and a tie to divine spirits. Beyond that, the Undying Court is one of the few forces in the world that has a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy. Have you come to Khorvaire as an emissary of the Undying Court, whether as a diplomat or an agent of prophecy? Are you working on behalf of a noble family, pursuing mercantile interests, or seeking an artifact stolen from your people long ago? Are you an anthropologist fascinated by the behavior of humanity? Are you a paladin in the service of the Deathguard, charged to exterminate undead wherever they can be found? Or are you an exile, driven from your homeland and forced to live among the barbarians?</p>
  <p>Whether you play an Aereni character or encounter them as NPCs, this section provides insight into the land of the elves.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ABriefGuideToAerenal">A Brief Guide To Aerenal</h3>

  <p>Aerenal is an isolated nation with little interest in the outside world. They have little fear of conquest; the divine power of the Undying Court has repelled assaults by legions of dragons. But the power of the Undying Court doesn’t extend beyond Aerenal, and the elves have chosen to remain in their haven rather than to expand across the world. From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheUndyingCourt">The Undying Court</h4>

  <p>Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to <em>Spirit Idols</em>, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These spirits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.</p>
  <p>Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it’s true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to all the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the <em>Spirit Idols</em>. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor—this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years—but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.</p>
  <p>As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones—such as the one in Shae Mordai—but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn’t rely on faith; there’s no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people—from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AMagicalKingdom">A Magical Kingdom</h4>

  <p>Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice’s training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. Teleportation circles link Aerenal’s great cities, and [spells]Sending[/spells] stations allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of [spells]Stone Shape[/spells]. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft Very Rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it’s little more than a primitive backwater.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="PerfectionInThePast">Perfection in the Past</h4>

  <p>At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren’t trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan’s goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters—and in Aerenal, they’re still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a Very Rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it’s a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of Common and Uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You’ve never been encouraged to innovate; you’ve been taught that the old ways are the best ways. Do you agree with this?</p>

    <aside id="SpiritIdolsDeathless" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>Spirit Idols</p>
    <p>The deathless state isn’t the only way to experience eternity. Most honored dead of Aerenal are preserved in <em>Spirit Idols</em> that preserve the soul from the dissolution of Dolurrh. This stone bust of a dead elf holds relics of their corpse (bone shards, a lock of hair) embedded within it. While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance—a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A Spirit Idol can be awakened with the [spells]Speak with Dead[/spells] spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.</p>
    <p>Not all Aereni want to become deathless—many consider the Spirit Idol the superior state. The deathless are sworn to protect and serve the living, and must deal with the ongoing inconvenience of physical existence; within a Spirit Idol, an elf can experience eternal peace in a dream of their own making. For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.</p>
    <p>While there are more <em>Spirit Idols</em> than there are deathless, not all dead are preserved this way. <em>Spirit Idols</em> are reserved for those who have proven worthy of eternal existence. The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes—such as grave robbers—are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives.</p>
    </aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="NobleLines">Noble Lines</h3>

  <p>Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, “the line of Mendyrian” refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname—such as Belaereth Mendyrian—is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it’s not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings—the rulers of the united kingdom—are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren’t blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.</p>
  <p>In creating an Aereni elf, work with your DM to develop details about your family and the line you owe allegiance to. Since each line is an alliance of multiple families, there’s room for you to add your own details even within an existing line. A few of the noble lines are described below, but look to these as a source of inspiration rather than a limitation.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Jhaelian.</em></strong> The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many Monks, Clerics, and Paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard—the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the deathless themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Melideth.</em></strong> Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy. Due to its mercantile tradition, Melideth Aereni are more comfortable with foreigners than many of their kin. Facial tattoos are a common practice among the Melideth.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Mendyrian.</em></strong> The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal’s history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted Wizards and Artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Tolaen.</em></strong> Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal’s lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal’s soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Valraea.</em></strong> All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of sea elves. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. While Valraea characters are aquatic elves, they are culturally Aereni and all the other material in this section applies to them. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone. More information about the <a href="">Valraea Aereni</a> can be found in chapter 4.</p>
  <p>The line of Vol once governed the region around Shae Deseir, but that line was broken and all ties to the bloodlines bearing the Mark of Death were eliminated thousands of years ago. There are many other noble lines among the Aereni, and you are free to create your own as called for by your story.</p>
  <p>In creating an Aereni character, how does your heritage impact you? What line are you tied to and who’s your family? Are they respected? Do you respect your leaders? What’s one unusual custom tied to your line? Do you aspire to join the noble line?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TranceAndGender">Trance and Gender</h4>

  <p>The Fey Ancestry of the elves runs deeper than most humans realize. Elf characters receive the same benefits from a [rules]Long Rest[/rules] as members of other species, but the process of that rest is entirely different for an elf and a human. It’s common knowledge that elves experience a state of trance rather than sleeping. But what is a trance? On a practical level, an elf meditates on their memories and emotions and reflects on the events of the day. On a magical, instinctive level they are comparing their body to their subconscious self-image and changing it to match that image. It’s in this way that an Elf character gains the healing benefits of a Long Rest, their body restoring itself to match their ideal state. This is also the source of an elf’s long lifespan. The apparent age of an elf has nothing to do with their chronological age and everything to do with their image of themself; an elf can potentially appear young and vibrant right up until the time they finally fade. An elf’s appearance and gender can change over the course of a trance, but this is a subconscious process and not something an elf can control with precision. For a particular elf, their eye color or hair color may shift to reflect their mood, but they can’t force this change as a form of disguise. In playing an Elf, this is an opportunity for you to consider how your mood and your experiences could be reflected by minor physical changes—but this isn’t the same as being a Changeling and shifting however and whenever you wish. Because of this, the elves of Eberron have a very fluid relationship with gender. Some maintain a single gender throughout their lives; others change from day to day.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Mentors">Mentors</h3>

  <p>As an Aereni elf, you aren’t considered an adult until you’ve passed your first century. During that time, you undergo deep schooling in the traditions of your line and your chosen profession. If you’re using the Origin feats presented in chapter 6, this is when you develop your Aereni Expertise. A century is a long time, and you’ve surely developed important relationships in your youth. In creating your character, work with your DM to establish a mentor—an NPC who played a particularly critical role in your early life.</p>
  <p>The Aereni Mentors table provides ideas for developing a mentor. Consider whether they play an ongoing role in your life or were simply a vital inspiration. Are you now working on behalf of your mentor? Are you hoping to solve a mystery for them? To find something they need? To somehow clear their name or vindicate their beliefs? Are you your mentor’s protégé or favored student, or are you driven by the fact that you disappointed them and were banished from their company? Perhaps you have a rival who betrayed your mentor—or stole your place with them!</p>


    <aside id="" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>Aereni Names</p>
    <p>Aereni names tend to be multiple syllables, and commonly contain the ae diphthong. With foreigners, Aereni often use only their personal name and identify their line; surnames are generally used in introductions to other elves. Only members of the noble line will use the name of their line as a surname. While names have a masculine or feminine association, Aereni typically maintain their chosen name regardless of current gender.</p>
    <p><strong>Male:</strong> Aeren, Belaereth, Carden, Dalaer, Dayne, Helaeras, Jhalaer, Jhayne, Maeran, Mazareth, Mayne, Shaeras, Taen, Thaendyr, Tolan, Varaendyr, Varonen</p>
    <p><strong>Female:</strong> Ashaelyn, Erandis, Etrigani, Heladaen, Jhalira, Laeren, Mazalira, Minaera, Serandis, Syraen, Taelira, Tazaera, Thaera, Vadallia, Vaeren</p>
    <p><strong>Surnames:</strong> Alaraen, Alorenthi, Daelian, Dyraen, Halaen, Jholareth, Jholyr, Maloraen, Mendaen, Mol, Shialaen, Shol, Tolarenthi</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AereniQuirks">Aereni Quirks</h3>

  <p>In creating an Aereni character, consider the following.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Hidden Faces.</em></strong> The Aereni often alter their features following the traditions of their ancestors or their line. Jhaelian Aereni mortify their flesh to appear deathless even while alive. Melideth Aereni favor facial tattoos, often of skulls or other gothic images. All of the lines have distinctive masks, whether of metal, wood, or leather, worn by agents of the line when conducting official business. Likewise, priests of the Undying Court wear the golden mask of the Court when acting in its service. Do you wear a mask, have tattoos, or other cosmetic alterations?</p>
  <p><strong><em>Perfect Technique.</em></strong> Aereni are obsessed with tradition—not simply mastering a skill, but performing it in the perfect style of ancient masters. Where Aundair encourages aspiring wizards to develop their own unique style for incantations and gestures, an Aereni wizard spends a decade perfecting their diction then another mastering somatic gestures. Aereni spellcasting isn’t just functional, it’s beautiful. In describing your actions, add details about the grace and artistry of your movements. Namedrop the ancient elves who developed the techniques you’re using today. When you begin using a new ability that you just acquired after gaining a level, your in-character explanation could be that you’ve been practicing this spell for five years, and only just perfected it.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Tradition versus Innovation.</em></strong> The Aereni cling to the past rather than looking to the future. Do you do the same? Are you working to master the techniques of your ancestors, to find lost artifacts of your line, or are you challenging tradition? Perhaps you have an entirely new idea that you feel could change Aerenal and earn you a place in the Undying Court—but you’ve left Aerenal so you can master it without being discouraged by those who dwell in the past. Or perhaps you don’t yet have a new idea, but you’re convinced that your people need to move forward, and you’re exploring different lands in search of inspiration.</p>
  <p><strong><em>New in Town?</em></strong> If you’re a recent arrival to Khorvaire, you might make a few mistakes based on your experience in your homeland. You could suggest that a priest of the Sovereign Host request an audience with Aureon; after all, you could visit your gods in Shae Mordai for important matters. If a historical figure comes up in conversation, you could suggest speaking with them; surely Galifar or Mishann would be preserved as <em>Spirit Idols</em>. What kind of fools would let important souls be lost? What do you mean, we can’t just teleport from Sharn to Korth?</p>
  <p><strong><em>Vampires Suck.</em></strong> As an Aereni elf, you’re used to living with the dead, but those deathless are sustained with positive energy. In contrast, the Undying Court teaches that Mabaran undead—negative-energy undead, from skeletons and zombies to liches and vampires—are inherently destructive. Beyond the fact that many of them prey on the living to survive, they’re conduits to Mabar and drain the ambient life from the world simply by existing. It may not be provable, but you believe it’s a concrete environmental threat—have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who’s going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AereniBackgrounds">Aereni Backgrounds</h3>

  <p>As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you’re far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character’s new life.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Acolyte.</em></strong> As an Acolyte, you’re a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won’t place themselves in danger, but they’ll show respect and support you.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Artisan.</em></strong> Most Aereni Artisans pursue peaceful lives focused on their craft. Have you abandoned your craft, or is your reason for adventuring tied to it? Perhaps you are searching for the lost sword of a legendary Aereni smith, or feel that you must hone your own skill with the blade before you can forge the perfect sword.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Charlatan and Criminal.</em></strong> Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you’re an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades—one of their spies—in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Entertainer.</em></strong> As an Entertainer, consider whether you’ve primarily performed in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni—who will want to license any popular act—or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?</p>
  <p><strong><em>Guard or Soldier.</em></strong> You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a Cleric or Paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you’ve had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?</p>
  <p><strong><em>Hermit, Sage, or Scribe.</em></strong> Each of these are a sound path for Aereni elves. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent Sage or Scribe. As a Hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Noble.</em></strong> As a member of a noble line, you weren’t born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You’re seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you’re also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your position of privilege should still open doors in high society.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Sailor.</em></strong> The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.</p>
  <p>The Far Traveler and Inheritor backgrounds from the <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</a> are sound choices for an Aereni elf. The Haunted One background from <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/cos">Curse of Strahd</a> could reflect something you saw in the Mabaran manifest zones of your homeland—or you could be literally haunted by an ancestor.</p>

    <aside id="WhatAboutTairnadal" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>What About the Tairnadal?</p>
    <p>The Aereni are the dominant culture of Aerenal. The Tairnadal are a separate culture that came to Aerenal during the exodus and laid claim to the northern steppes. Rather than preserving their ancestors as deathless or <em>Spirit Idols</em>, the Tairnadal believe they anchor their ancestors by emulating their heroic deeds.</p>
    <p>The Tairnadal have a long alliance with the Aereni and fight alongside their cousins when the island is threatened. It’s possible for elves to immigrate from one culture to another; the line of Tolaen is known for having close ties to the Tairnadal. But they’re separate cultures; the Tairnadal don’t worship the Undying Court and its warriors don’t become deathless.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="KalashtarBetweenTwoWorlds">Kalashtar: Between Two Worlds</h2>

  <p>You were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. You have memories of a life you’ve never lived, visions of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. When you sleep, you don’t dream as others do, but you often wake with a sense of purpose or new ideas. You see the pain and suffering in the world and know that there is a path to light—but there are monsters in the shadows, faceless enemies that have been hunting you since before you were born.</p>
  <p>Will you embrace the spirit within you and make its struggle your own? Will you stand against the darkness, even if it draws the many eyes of the Dreaming Dark upon you? Or will you ignore that inner voice and try to live your own life?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="KalashtarOrigins">Kalashtar Origins</h3>

  <p>The quori are spirits of nightmare. But just as angels can fall, fiends can rise. Centuries ago, a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that dominates Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark hunted them across the dreamscape, seeking to consume and reclaim them. In desperation, these rebel spirits reached out to Eberron, finding a haven in the minds and bodies of a group of Adaran monks. Sixty-seven spirits escaped, and the first kalashtar were born.</p>
  <p>As a Kalashtar, you’re descended from one of these monks. A quori is bound to your bloodline. It exists in the minds and dreams of all of your siblings, and as long as one of you is alive the quori is sustained. Should you all die, the spirit will be lost... and so, the Dreaming Dark is always happy to kill a kalashtar.</p>
  <p>The kalashtar were born centuries ago, and have since spread out from Adar. What is your background? What has set you on the path to adventure? Are you searching for allies against the Dreaming Dark, or are you pursuing a mission of your own?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Adaran">Adaran</h4>

  <p>The kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly besiege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won’t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light.</p>
  <p>Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. If you are from Adar, what caused you to leave your monastery and brave the Riedran blockades? Have the elders entrusted you with a specific mission, or has your quori spirit driven you to distant lands? The <a href="">Hermit background</a> is a good way to reflect a mystic from a distant land possessing dangerous revelations.</p>
  <p>Of all the origins mentioned here, you likely have the strongest connection to your quori spirit. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. You were taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness; can you reconcile this with your adventuring life? If you’ve recently arrived in Khorvaire after living your life in a monastery, you are unaccustomed to crime and greed. Is the chaos of a city like Sharn disorienting?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Khorvairian">Khorvairian</h4>

  <p>There are kalashtar communities in several of the major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. Kalashtar prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. If you were raised in such a community, you’re familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there’s no Riedran army at the gates; you know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it’s a ghost in the shadows.</p>
  <p>Many kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don’t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and to ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher’s focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.</p>
  <p>As a Kalashtar of Khorvaire, you could bring a compassionate approach to any background; whether you’re an Acolyte of the Path of Light, a wise Sage, or a lively Entertainer, you do your best to help the innocent and lift spirits. Criminal and Charlatan would be unusual paths, but the <a href="">Criminal background</a> could reflect the work of a Shadow Watcher. While you aren’t as isolated from the world as an Adaran kalashtar, you’re still guided by alien instincts and have an otherworldly demeanor.Orphan</p>
  <p>Kalashtar can breed with humans and half-elves, and their children have an equal chance of being fully kalashtar or the species of the other parent. Kalashtar are quite rare; even in cities like Sharn with kalashtar communities, there are many people who will assume kalashtar are just humans with strange eyes... or some sort of half-elf, maybe? Maybe it’s a new fashion?</p>
  <p>As such, there are kalashtar in Khorvaire who grew up without the guidance of a kalashtar parent. Orphans may be entirely unaware of their heritage and the nature of their quori spirit—it tries to communicate through dream-visions and instincts, but lacking any context, such orphans rarely understand their quori bond. Nonetheless, the quori is an integral part of them, urging them toward the light—and indeed, most orphans follow such a path. A kalashtar orphan who chooses a darker path is fighting the instincts imparted by their spirit. Such a kalashtar is likely to be deeply conflicted, which can manifest as unidentified stress, fits of rage, depression, or unpredictable behavior.</p>
  <p>An orphan kalashtar can follow any path. Whether altruistic, nefarious, or somewhere in between, work with your DM to decide how you interpret the influence of your quori bond. Have you followed its guidance despite not knowing its true nature? Do you interpret it as a curse or ghost, twisting your thoughts and putting you at odds with yourself? Have you found the inner determination to suppress it entirely? Do you ultimately want to come to terms with your kalashtar nature, or do you like being an outsider and prefer to stay that way?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheQuoriBond">The Quori Bond</h3>

  <p>As a Kalashtar, you’re part of a spiritual lineage, traditionally reflected by the suffix of your name. For example, Lanhareth and Minhareth are both kalashtar of the lineage of Hareth. Your lineage is set before birth, tied to one of your parents. If you are born to kalashtar of Vaktri and Hareth, you inherit only one of the bonds, often that of the parent of your gender. Since you can’t inherit both bonds, you won’t be half Hareth and half Vaktri. Your lineage affects your appearance and personality, eye color, hair color, and other aspects. When you meet another kalashtar of your lineage, you’ll see common traits, but you’ll also feel a deeper connection; in some ways, you’re one person.</p>
  <p>The quori bond exists on a deep level. Your quori doesn’t hover over your shoulder or whisper in your ear. Instead, it exists in the collective subconscious of all kalashtar of your lineage, shaping and guiding you all. You feel it as instinct, in memories of things you’ve never done—visions of a war in the realm of dreams. When you sleep, you don’t dream, but the bond grows stronger. Your quori may even give visions to guide you. With time and training, you can strengthen this connection, learning to hear its psychic voice more clearly; the <a href="">Quori Bond feat</a> presented in chapter 6 is one way to reflect this stronger bond. Ultimately, it’s up to you how you roleplay your connection. While the quori isn’t an active presence that responds in conversation, some kalashtar do speak to it as if it was, talking with the quori as a way of processing their own thoughts. Others take comfort in its subconscious presence, confident it is with them at all times. And some—notably orphans—refuse to acknowledge it, determined to see their mind as their own.</p>
  <p>In creating a Kalashtar character, it’s important to consider what type of quori you’re bound to. You can develop this through roleplaying, but it can also be reflected by your choice of class and by your abilities or spells. Each quori has a connection to a particular emotion. Fiendish quori feed on this emotion, using it to manipulate mortals. In your case, it could be that you understand how to generate that emotion in others, or that you yourself experience that emotion in a deep and powerful way. Or it could be that you have learned how to suppress that emotion, and that is the source of your strength. Whatever choice you make, it will be reflected throughout your lineage. If you decide that Vaktri is a du’ulora quori and that you draw on his burning fury to produce your own Barbarian Rage, then other Vaktri kalashtar you meet may also be barbarians or furious warriors.</p>
  <p>The three quori presented in Eberron: Rising from the Last War are described below, along with another fourth common quori, <a href="">the Du’ulora</a>, whose statistics are presented in chapter 8. If you want to develop a kalashtar from another quori lineage, discuss it with your DM.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Duaposulora">Du&apos;ulora</h4>

  <p>The fiendish du’ulora are spirits of rage and aggression. In Dal Quor, they craft dreams that drive feuds and vendettas, spurring mortals to violence and vengeance. Your du’ulora spirit has turned against the darkness, but fury remains its domain and anger is your birthright. How do you express this? As a Bard, you might specialize in taunting enemies, turning their anger against them and driving them to rash action. As a Barbarian, you could say that your spirit is the source of your Rage. As a Paladin, you might channel its fury when you smite your foes. You might be calm and serene most of the time, expressing sudden powerful moments of rage when you draw on your bond.</p>
  <p>The key thing to remember is that your du’ulora has chosen the path of light, even if it is a spirit of rage. You may revel in moments when you get to unleash your anger on your enemies, but it still drives you to fight for a noble cause. Your fury is a tool, and you should never let it drag you into darkness.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Hashalaq">Hashalaq</h4>

  <p>The hashalaq are seducers and deceivers, feeding on doubt and desire. They are the spies and loremasters of the quori. Hashalaq kalashtar make excellent Bards; the College of Lore reflects both your love of knowledge and your ability to confuse your foes. Hashalaq also make excellent Warlocks, with your spirit granting the Beguiling Influence Eldritch Invocation and allowing you to charm your enemies. As a hashalaq Kalashtar, consider whether you specialize in deception, or choose to be honest and focus on your ability to inspire positive emotion—do you prefer cunning Deception or empathic Persuasion? Hashalaq Clerics typically follow this latter path, using their knowledge to guide allies and cut through the deception that comes so naturally to their kind.</p>
  <p>Kalaraq</p>
  <p>The kalaraq are spirits of pride and ambition. The natural leaders of the quori, they dominate through sheer charisma and force of will. As a kalaraq Kalashtar, you surely have your own grand ambitions. You excel at inspiring others to follow you and you won’t hesitate to take bold action. You might lead in the vanguard as a Paladin, or strengthen your allies as a Cleric, or bend enemies to your will as a Bard of the College of Glamour. The kalaraq are also known as the eyebinders, capable of consuming and binding weak souls; you could be a Warlock or Wizard who specializes in summoning or binding spirits.</p>
  <p>The kalaraq are the rarest and most powerful of the quori. The kalaraq Taratai was the leader of the rebels, and hers is the only spiritual lineage that has been completely destroyed by the Dreaming Dark; Taratai’s own fate is unknown. There are only a couple remaining kalaraq lines, and as a kalaraq Kalashtar, others may look to you for bold leadership and guidance.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Tsucora">Tsucora</h4>

  <p>The tsucora feed on terror and craft the most classic nightmares. As a tsucora Kalashtar, you have a deep understanding of fear. This is an excellent foundation for a Bard of the College of Whispers or a Warrior of the Living Weapon Monk (<a href="">in chapter 6</a>), sowing fear with a word or a touch. Likewise, you could be a Great Old One Patron Warlock tormenting your enemies with [spells]Fear[/spells] and [spells]Dissonant Whispers[/spells]. On the other hand, you could take the path of an inspiring Cleric who bolsters your allies against fear, using your knowledge of it to strengthen their resolve. Tsucora kalashtar often seem cold and intimidating, but despite your knowledge of nightmares, you are still looking toward the light.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="PsychicPower">Psychic Power</h3>

  <p>Kalashtar are known for their psychic gifts, but aside from their Mind Link, how does this manifest in a kalashtar character? In fifth edition, how do they wield mental power? Chapter 6 presents the Mind Domain Cleric and two Kalashtar specific feats. In addition, characters carry an innate sense of mental discipline—a Kalashtar Monk could consider Focus Points as a representation of psionic ability, and the Warrior of the Living Weapon subclass in chapter 6 builds on this. But you can also change the flavor of a class without altering the mechanics. Consider the following ideas.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Bards">Bards</h4>

  <p>Many kalashtar seek to fight evil through inspiration, and the Bard can be an excellent foundation for this. While Bardic Inspiration is described as supernatural inspiration through “words, music, or dance,” you can describe your actions as being tied to psychic gifts; instead of a mystical song, you could describe your inspiration as a word backed by a surge of psychic energy. When you use the Words of Terror of the College of Whispers (from <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/XGtE">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a>) or the Cutting Words of the College of Lore, this could easily reflect your powers of psychic manipulation. Likewise, your spellcasting is mechanically magic; it can be counterspelled, it won’t work in an [spells]Antimagic Field[/spells], and so on. But you can easily describe [spells]Vicious Mockery[/spells] or [spells]Crown of Madness[/spells] as psychic attacks, or present [spells]Cure Wounds[/spells] as a psychometabolic effect, using your mind to knit together the wounds of another. You gain no mechanical advantage from this—in the case of Bardic Inspiration, your target still has to be able to hear you, even if you’re using psychic power—but there’s nothing preventing you from presenting your Bard as being psychically gifted as opposed to singing magic songs.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ClericsAndPaladins">Clerics and Paladins</h4>

  <p>Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic. Priests of the Path of Light say that the faithful are inspired by il-Yannah—the great light that will one day rise to replace the Dreaming Dark—but their power comes from within. As such, both Cleric and Paladin are logical paths for a kalashtar, and you can add psychic flavor to your spells as described with the Bard above. When you cast Command, you aren’t demanding your victim bow to il-Yannah; instead, il-Yannah is strengthening your mind and allowing you to impose your will on the target. Effects such as Bless could reflect your ongoing psychic guidance, while [spells]Cure Wounds[/spells] and similar spells could be psychometabolic. Your faith [action]helps[/action] you focus your mind, but it’s your mind that generates the power. If you want to take this further, the Mind Domain presented in chapter 6 allows you to replace Radiant damage with Psychic damage; thus, you can flavor your [spells]Sacred Flame[/spells] as a psionic blast instead of holy fire.</p>
  <p>This same concept can work for a Divine Soul Sorcerer (from <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a>). You don’t use the trappings of a [monsters]priest[/monsters], but your visions of il-Yannah have allowed you to focus your mind and alter reality. You can select spells that feel like they could be psychic powers; when you cast [spells][monsters]Mage[/monsters] Hand[/spells], it can be flavored as an act of telekinesis.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Fighters">Fighters</h4>

  <p>The Psi Warrior subclass in the <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/phb-2024">2024 Player’s Handbook</a> is an excellent path for a Kalashtar Fighter. Its features primarily reflect the idea of telekinesis—Protective Field, Psi-Powered Leap, Telekinetic Thrust. But even if you choose a different subclass, you can still flavor the class features of the Fighter as psychic gifts. You could describe your Second Wind as psychometabolic healing, and Action Surge as slowing your perception of time. Tactical Mind could even be described as a minor ability to alter reality, shifting the outcome of your fate.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Rogues">Rogues</h4>

  <p>The Soulknife has long been called out as a tradition used by both kalashtar and their Inspired foes. Your Psychic Blades could be manifestations of pure energy, or they might have a visual connection to your quori spirit. A Soulknife Rogue with a tsucora spirit could manifest barbed blades formed from razor-sharp chitin, while one with a hashalaq spirit could manifest blades formed from tendrils of dream-stuff that radiate a sense of calm.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Warlocks">Warlocks</h4>

  <p>You can describe your Warlock spells as being drawn from psychic power as opposed to arcane invocations. Whatever subclass you choose, your patron is your quori spirit. As a Warlock, you have an especially strong bond to this spirit and receive clearer visions than most kalashtar of your lineage; traditionally, kalashtar with such a strong connection are called atavists. The Great Old One Patron is an easy choice, as many of its spells reflect mental manipulation; you can describe [spells]Evard’s Black Tentacles[/spells] as ectoplasmic projections, or [spells]Armor of Agathys[/spells] as a blend of telekinetic force and cryokinesis. The Awakened Mind feature soon becomes obsolete due to Mind Link; a DM could choose to combine the two, increasing the range of a Kalashtar Warlock’s Mind Link feature by 30 feet. The Celestial Patron is another logical choice, focusing on your quori as a spirit of light. As a Warlock of the Hexblade Patron (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) or one that chose the Pact of the Blade invocation, you can describe your weapon as being forged from nightmares.</p>
  <p>If you want to add more psionic flavor to your Warlock, your DM might allow you to shift the damage type of a few of your spells; could [spells]Eldritch Blast[/spells] inflict Psychic damage? And even with default rules, you can roleplay it as a burst of telekinetic force.</p>

    <aside id="CreatingLineage" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>Creating a Lineage</p>
    <p>Once you’ve chosen a quori spirit, next define your lineage, considering the traits you might share with other kalashtar bound to that same quori line. Here are two examples.</p>
    <p>Lurashtai began her existence as a tsucora quori. She wove dreams of gothic horror, playing on her victims’ fears of death and the undead. Raised on these morbid memories, the kalashtar of her line are comfortable with tragedy, have no fear of death, and see beauty in things that others find disturbing or terrifying. As a spirit of light, Lurashtai has taken an interest in the undead; she fears that by being trapped outside the cycle of life and dream, the undead weaken the shared soul of the age. As a result, the kalashtar of her line are often driven to hunt undead and lay their spirits to rest. Lurashtai kalashtar usually have pale complexions, sharp features, and silky, dark hair; they generally favor the color red in their clothing.</p>
    <p>Aveth, a hashalaq quori, wielded the twin weapons of manipulation and insight before his exodus from Dal Quor. He takes great interest in the potential that mortals hold to choose a nobler path, much as he and his kind fled darkness in search of light. The kalashtar of Aveth’s line prefer following their intuition over the careful planning of others. They have great confidence in their ability to win over potential foes, turning them into friends, which can yield unexpected allies—or the untimely death of the too-optimistic kalashtar. Aveth kalashtar usually have dark skin, black hair, a preference for blue and aquamarine, and a distinct dislike of peanuts.</p>
    </aside>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="ShiftersWildAndWary">Shifters: Wild and Wary</h2>

  <p>As a Shifter adventurer, you walk a path between the wilds and the civilized world. You are driven by primal instincts, the whispers of Wolf or Rat. When you embrace those voices, you transform. Do you see your shift-form as your true self, reveling in these moments of primal ascension? Or do you hate shifting, fearing that you might one day lose yourself to the beast within?</p>
  <p>In creating a Shifter, consider your roots and the spirit that drives you. What has set you on the path to adventure? Do you embrace the party as your pack, or are your companions just the means to an end?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ShifterOrigins">Shifter Origins</h3>

  <p>Shifters are relatively rare in the Five Nations; there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. The bulk of the shifter population of Khorvaire is based in the Towering Wood, the vast forest that stretches across the northwest. Over the last four decades, shifters have emerged from the deep woods to live in the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, shaping the culture of this new nation. Outside the Towering Wood, many shifters fled the violence and persecution of the Silver Crusade, leading to their scattering across the Five Nations. While the hysteria of the Silver Crusade has long since died down, there are still many who treat shifters with fear or suspicion. <em>They’re weretouched, more beast than human. They’re prone to violence—they can’t help it. Don’t they become dangerous when the moons are full?</em></p>
  <p>As a Shifter character, you don’t have to be tied to a shifter community. You could’ve grown up in the Five Nations, serving as a soldier or working for a dragonmarked house just as anyone else might have. But if you want deeper ties, consider the following options.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DeepForest">Deep Forest</h4>

  <p>The shifters of the Towering Wood, nomadic hunter-gatherers, follow the same traditions that have sustained their people for millennia. Their champions are Druids, Rangers, and Barbarians, and they are attuned to the beast within. But they know almost nothing about the world beyond the wood and have little experience with artifice or the wonders of the dragonmarked houses. If you’re from such a tribe, what drove you to leave the woods? Are you following a druidic prophecy? Pursuing an ancient evil that’s escaped from the wood? Have you been exiled from your tribe, or are you simply driven by curiosity? Guide and Hermit are both logical backgrounds for such a character.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EldeenReaches">Eldeen Reaches</h4>

  <p>Shifters played a strong role in the rise of the Eldeen Reaches. They can be found in the Warden militia, and many have settled in the farmlands, integrating with the other species in the area. The Reaches are a young nation that broke free from Aundair during the Last War, and there’s considerable fear that Aundair may try to reclaim the region. As an Eldeen shifter, are you a proud Reacher? Do you stand up for your people and take an aggressive stance against Aundair? Are your actions in some way helping your family? Or have you turned your back on the Reaches? Any background can work for an Eldeen shifter, but Farmer and Guide are both strong options.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="UrbanPack">Urban Pack</h4>

  <p>Due to the fear and prejudice of many strangers, shifters often form tight communities in the larger cities. Lower Northedge in Sharn holds most of the city’s shifters; as a child, you might have played hrazhak on the bridges or pissed on the shrine of Fathen the Martyr. Do you have ties to an extended family in a bad part of town, or are you a lone wolf? Did you serve in the Last War, and if so, was it a sign of devotion to your nation or were you just doing your job? Do you cling to any of the old traditions of the woods, or do you see stories of Grandmother Wolf as foolish superstition?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheBeastWithin">The Beast Within</h3>

  <p>Your shifter lineage isn’t driven by genetics—two Beasthide shifters can have a Swiftstride child. Young shifters have the same general phenotype, but as a child you find your beast within; this sets your lineage, triggering physical and psychological changes. The tribes of the Towering Wood believe that these beasts are totem spirits; Moonspeaker Druids tell stories of Grandmother Wolf and Grandfather Rat, and shifter hunters may swear by Tiger’s Blood.</p>
  <p>Your beast within is reflected by your lineage and shapes your personality and appearance. If your beast is the Tiger, you likely have feline features, which are exaggerated when you shift. However, the beast is ultimately a reflection of who you are; you can attribute your wild temper to your Boar nature, but it’s not a truly independent force like the quori spirits of the kalashtar.</p>
  <p>Moonspeaker druids respect many spirits, but the following five are usually associated with the beast within:</p>
  <p>The <strong>Bear</strong> embodies strength and caution; in contrast to the Boar, the Bear pauses before taking rash action. Shifters tied to the Bear are typically Beasthide.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Boar</strong> possesses great endurance and is celebrated for its honesty and lack of guile; however, it is also seen as being reckless and overly enthusiastic, often prone to rash action. Boar shifters are typically Beasthide.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Rat</strong> is clever and stealthy. Lacking physical strength, Grandfather Rat uses wits to overcome his enemies. Rat shifters are usually Swiftstride, but can also be Wildhunt.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Tiger</strong> is known for grace and speed, seen as a valiant hunter. In contrast to those guided by the Wolf or Rat, those touched by Tiger tend to be loners. Tigers are usually Swiftstride or Wildhunt.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Wolf</strong> is considered wise and honorable, the pillar of a community and keeper of the druidic mysteries. Wolf shifters with a martial bent tend to be Longtooth, while Druids guided by Grandmother Wolf are usually Wildhunt.</p>
  <p>Chapter 6 presents two character options that can represent your connection to the beast within, including the Superior Shifting feat and the Warrior of the Living Weapon subclass for Monks. In creating a Shifter character, consider both the nature of your beast within and how you relate to it. If you’re a Wildhunt Shifter with lupine characteristics, do you think of yourself as being touched by Grandmother Wolf? Do you play up this aspect of your personality, or do you largely try to ignore it?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ShiftersAndReligion">Shifters and Religion</h3>

  <p>Shifter Paladins and Clerics are rare. Shifters have a natural tie to primal forces and are more likely to embrace these as opposed to the abstract religions of the east. While shifters can be found in all of the Eldeen druidic sects, the Moonspeakers are a sect tied specifically to shifter traditions; Moonspeakers usually follow the Circle of the Moon or the Circle of the Shepherd (from <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/XGtE">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a>). Moonspeaker druids respect the totems associated with the beast within—Grandmother Wolf, Cousin Bear—but they don’t see these spirits as gods. These beasts guide shifters from within—they don’t shape the world itself.</p>
  <p>The Silver Crusade is a festering wound that left most shifters feeling bitter and suspicious of the organized religions of the Five Nations. However, there are shifters who recognize that the Crusade was a tragedy caused by the failings of people rather than being the fault of the Flame itself; over the decades, there have been a number of shifter heroes who have embraced the Silver Flame and sought to form a bridge between their people and Flamekeep. There’s still much work to be done here—but your character could be the one called to do it.</p>
  <p>In the Five Nations, a few shifters have abandoned the Moonspeaker traditions and instead taken up the Sovereign Host. The Hounds of Balinor are a shifter sect whose members believe that shifters are the chosen of Balinor and that the Sovereign of the Hunt strengthens them when they shift. Others embrace the Three Faces of the Wild—the worship of Arawai, Balinor, and the Devourer. A few have turned to the Blood of Vol, blending the idea of the divinity within with the beast within.</p>
  <p>As often as not, however, shifters focus on their inner strength and instincts as opposed to seeking guidance from divine sources. Many city shifters are actively suspicious of Clerics and Paladins, especially followers of the Silver Flame.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ShiftersAndLycanthropes">Shifters and Lycanthropes</h3>

  <p>Shifters and lycanthropes are clearly related. Both transform into a more bestial state. Shifters have affinities for bear, boar, rat, and wolf; could it be mere coincidence that these are the most common forms of lycanthrope? And yet, the differences between shifter and lycanthrope are vast. Being a shifter isn’t a condition that can be passed by a bite. Shifters have full control over their gifts, while lycanthropes struggle with them. The beast within may shape a shifter’s personality, but it doesn’t overwhelm it. By contrast, lycanthropy attempts to destroy the victim’s original personality and can turn the most virtuous hero into a bloodthirsty murderer. Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn’t encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn’t urge murder. And perhaps most important of all: shifters themselves can become lycanthropes. This isn’t in their blood; lycanthropy is a curse, and it can afflict them just like it can any other humanoid.</p>
  <p>The Moonspeaker druids tell a tale of five shifter champions who ventured too deep into the Towering Woods. They hunted a great evil, but when they caught it, they were overwhelmed; its evil filled their hearts, and it sent them back to prey on their friends and families. If anyone survived their attacks, the evil would seep through the wound and poison their hearts as well. These, they say, were the first lycanthropes.</p>
  <p>The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars. When the templars responded, the beasts that were slain reverted to their natural forms, revealing that they were shifters. The word quickly spread: all shifters were weretouched, capable of turning into savage beasts. None could be trusted! Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.</p>
  <p>The fact of the matter is that <em>lycanthropy is a weapon</em>; it spreads through violence and turns its victims into killers. Its origins may never be discovered, but the Moonspeaker tale is as logical as any. Lycanthropes and shifters are related in that the first lycanthropes were cursed shifters. The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade—and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It’s said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it’s up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is. In battling the cults of the Dragon Below, could you face the original shifter champions corrupted by Dyrrn? Or might the schemes of the Lords of Dust unleash the Wild Heart?</p>
  <p>While shifters and lycanthropes aren’t the same, the story and the stereotype is well established. Everyone calls the shifters “weretouched.” Beyond the Towering Woods, there are many shifters who indeed believe they are thin-blooded lycanthropes. And the wounds caused by the Silver Crusade and the Pure Flame will never completely heal. But despite the stereotype, the shifters of the Towering Woods fear and fight evil lycanthropes, and their tribes include Hunter Rangers who specialize in hunting werewolves. Shifters and lycanthropes resemble one another, but they are not the same—and shifters are just as vulnerable to the curse of lycanthropy as humans are.</p>

<aside id="ShiftersTotemsPath" class="text--rules-sidebar">
    <p>Shifters and Totems</p>
    <p>The Path of the Wild Heart Barbarian is a strong choice for a Shifter character. But how do the Path of the Wild Heart options overlap with your ties to the beast within? If you decide that you’re a Beasthide Shifter with a Bear spirit, can you choose Wolf when you activate your Rage of the Wilds feature? Of course you can—even as a Path of the Wild Heart Barbarian, you’re not bound to a single beast. You could play up the idea that you feel a connection to multiple spirits. With your DM’s approval, you could even have your character develop physical traits tied to your other spirits; you’ve always been a big, bearlike warrior, but now you manifest lupine ears and fangs when you shift.</p>
    <p>Another option is to rename your class features to match your beast within. There’s no reason you can’t choose the Bear option for the Rage of the Wilds feature but call it “Boar” instead. There is no Rat option, but you could take the Eagle option and call it Rat. Ultimately this is a question of story. If you want to highlight your tie to a single spirit and it makes sense, just change the names. But there’s nothing wrong with having a menagerie of spirits!</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="WarforgedSteelAndSoul">Warforged: Steel and Soul</h2>

  <p>As a warforged, your body was made in a Cannith forgehold. The creation forge wove rootlike muscles across a frame of metal and darkwood, bathing your body in alchemical fluids, giving you skin of steel or hardened leather. And then the miracle occurred: you came to life. You are made from wood and steel, but you are alive, aware, capable of feeling love and anger. You were born with an innate sense of your purpose, the knowledge of war burned into the back of your mind. But you aren’t bound to follow the path that your creators planned for you. You have freedom. You have the ability to learn. Perhaps you even have a soul.</p>
  <p>As a warforged, you were created for a reason—what was it? How did you find a new purpose and become an adventurer? What do you want from life now? Are you concerned about the fate of the warforged as a species, or do you feel more of a kinship with your adventuring companions than you do with other warforged?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="OriginAndPurpose">Origin and Purpose</h3>

  <p>The first warforged were built for battle. As Cannith refined its techniques, what started as simple infantry gave way to more sophisticated designs: lithe scouts with mithral plating, powerful juggernauts, even “living wands” wielding the power of sorcerers. As people grew more accustomed to these living constructs, Cannith began designing civilian warforged with a wide array of talents.</p>
  <p>As a warforged, you have the ability to learn, and your background and class features could reflect this. If you’re a warforged Bard, were you built to entertain, or were you created as a simple laborer only to discover remarkable talent within yourself? If you’re a Sorcerer, were you designed to channel arcane power, or is it an unexpected development? Determine your original purpose from the options below, then consider how it relates to who you are today.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Battlefield">Battlefield</h4>

  <p>Like most warforged, you were designed to serve in the Last War. You didn’t choose your side; you were sold to one of the Five Nations and set to work. You weren’t taught to question this role—war was the only purpose you knew. Some warforged came to feel a patriotic attachment to the nation they served, despising the enemies they fought. Others felt a close bond to the officers and soldiers they served with, fighting for this “family” rather than for a nation. How about you? Which nation did you fight for? Do you consider yourself to be a Thrane or a Cyran, or do you have no love for the nation that bought you and threw you on the front lines?</p>
  <p>Warforged were in service for the last three decades of the war. How long did you serve? What was your most dramatic experience? Did combat leave you with lasting scars or damage, even if they have no mechanical effect on your character?</p>
  <p>For many warforged, class abilities reflect the role you played on the battlefield. As a Fighter, you likely fought in the vanguard. As a Ranger or Rogue, you may have been designed as a scout. A Barbarian’s Rage could reflect a “battle mode”— you don’t actually get angry, but you temporarily increase your damage output and resistance. Class abilities gained over time could reflect an evolution of that design as you unlock your full potential—is this true for you, or are you developing unexpected talents?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Civilian">Civilian</h4>

  <p>In the last decade of the Last War, Cannith began selling warforged to civilian organizations. This wasn’t a common thing; a farmer couldn’t just go to the shop and take a warforged home. But you could have served a dragonmarked house, been a bodyguard or a tutor for a noble family, or even been designed to serve as an enforcer for a criminal organization. This path provides a wide range of possible backgrounds and unusual stories. If you take the Noble background, that doesn’t mean you hold noble rank yourself—you could be a trusted bodyguard who’s still treated as a member of the household. Perhaps a noble has made you their heir; such a thing would be unprecedented, but it would be an interesting story! With the Guard background, you could have served as the protector of a particular village, with the story of your brave deeds spreading far and wide.</p>
  <p>As a civilian warforged, does your class reflect your original purpose, or have you risen beyond that? For example, you could take the Sage background to reflect that you were designed to be a tutor or a researcher. You weren’t built to be a Wizard—but over the course of your career, you began to master the arcane, far exceeding the expectations of your creators.</p>
  <p>Warforged who served on the battlefield are forced to find a new life, because there is no war. As you weren’t made for war, did the end of the war have a dramatic impact on you? The Treaty of Thronehold released you from any form of indenture, but do you still feel an attachment to your family or village? Did you ever have a sense of loyalty to a nation, or has your worldview always been shaped by the people you worked with?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SpecializedOrUnique">Specialized or Unique</h4>

  <p>Battlefield warforged were largely mass produced. But there were many small runs of experimental warforged using specialized designs or experimental techniques. Perhaps your warforged Rogue was part of a secret unit of assassins that were never deployed; how many others were in the unit, and what became of them? As a warforged Entertainer, were you built to be a superstar—and if so, how does House Phiarlan feel about that? As a Druid, have you found a bond to the natural world within, or did an eccentric artificer design you with the potential to change shape and bond with natural creatures?</p>
  <p>In developing an exotic warforged, talk with your DM to develop details about your creator and your purpose. Are you one of a kind or part of a small run? Do you know who built you and why, or is your true purpose a mystery even to you?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="MindAndBody">Mind and Body</h3>

  <p>Cannith artificers designed your body and made you for a purpose. When the creation forge imbued you with life, there were things you <em>knew</em>. If you were built to be a warrior, you knew how to wield a sword and pike. You had an instinctive sense of squad tactics. There were things Cannith instructors had to teach you, but even there, it felt almost as if they were reminding you of things you already knew.</p>
  <p>This is one of the mysteries of the warforged. Where does your sentience come from? Cannith gave direction, but they didn’t design your mind; if they could, they’d have made you without emotion, and likely without the capacity for true independence. Many arcane scholars theorize that the creation forges don’t create the warforged mind, but rather summon it. Some believe that the warforged soul is drawn from the planes, that a warforged soldier is infused with the essence of Shavarath. Others suggest that the creation forges could be recycling husks from Dolurrh... perhaps the reason you sometimes feel that you’re remembering new skills is because you possessed those skills in a former life.</p>
  <p>Regardless, your Cannith instructors taught you to focus solely on the purpose they gave you. They trained you to suppress emotions, to be a weapon or a tool. Now you are free, able to explore your full potential. What does this mean for you? You can feel a full range of emotions, but do you? Or are you mystified by anger and love? What do you actually care about? Do you feel loyalty to a particular person? To a nation? To the future of the warforged species? Some warforged revel in the ability to choose a new path; others hold fast to their original purpose, and just want a reason to put those skills to work.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Evolution">Evolution</h4>

  <p>Warforged aren’t machines; they’re living, magical beings, and can evolve both physically and mentally. Just as you can learn new skills, your body can transform over time. This is one way to reflect class benefits; can you think of a way that your body could physically change to account for a new ability? If you gain the <a href="">Defense Fighting Style</a> feat, that might reflect your natural armor becoming thicker. If you’re a warforged Sorcerer, the ability to cast new spells could be reflected by arcane sigils appearing on your body, or by growing crystals that project light or energy. Never forget that you’re the product of magic as well as science. You may be made of metal and leather, but you’re also alive.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="IntegratedProtection">Integrated Protection</h4>

  <p>As a warforged, your armor is a part of you. Your skin is metal or leather, physically bonded to the rootlike tendrils that serve as your muscles. While it is possible for you to change your armor, very few warforged actually ever do this. The process is similar to a human peeling off their skin; while it’s not dangerous for the warforged, it’s a disturbing and uncomfortable experience. As an adventuring warforged, it’s an important ability to have, as it allows you to improve your defense and to make use of magical armor. But be aware of the weight of what you’re doing when you exchange your armor.</p>
  <p>Once you have integrated a suit of armor, it cannot be removed against your will. However, you are still considered to be wearing armor for purposes of the <a href="">Defense Fighting Style</a> feat or other feats and benefits that relate to armor. Likewise, integrated armor can be targeted by magical effects. The Juggernaut Plating feat presented in chapter 6 enhances your integrated armor and protects it from hostile magic.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="IntegratedTools">Integrated Tools</h4>

  <p>Just as a warforged can bond to armor or weapons, it’s possible to attach a tool to its body. There are two ways to do this. The first is to acquire an Integrated Tool. As presented <a href="">in chapter 7</a>, this is a Common magic item that requires Attunement; through attuning the tool, you bond it to your body. An alternative is to take the <a href="">Envoy Specialist feat</a> found in chapter 6. This gives you the benefit of an attached tool without requiring Attunement.</p>
  <p>Unlike an Armblade, an Integrated Tool represents more than just having a hammer attached to your hand. Most tools don’t represent one single object, but rather, a range of smaller items. How does this manifest with you? If you have a set of integrated [items]Thieves’ Tools[/items], do you use your fingers as lockpicks? Or do you draw the various tools you need out of compartments in your forearm? If you have an integrated instrument, is it built into your arm or your torso? Whatever you decide, remember that you have to have a hand free in order to make use of an Integrated Tool. You can say that your bagpipes are built into your chest, but you still need a free hand to play them.</p>
  <p>An Integrated Tool can be an interesting part of a character concept that reflects the purpose a warforged was built for. A Warforged Guide could have a set of [items]Cartographer’s Tools[/items] built into her body; she was designed to explore, using her Integrated Tools and innate sense of direction to constantly update her maps. A Warforged Entertainer with an integrated flute is a compelling image. In both cases, it’s not that the warforged acquires the tool, but rather, it was part of their original design. If you have an interesting origin story, you can see if your DM will allow you to take a tool you possess at character generation as an Integrated Tool. If not, Integrated Tools are Common magic items and can be easily acquired over the course of your adventures.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="WarforgedConcepts">Warforged Concepts</h3>

  <p>When creating a warforged character, a simple place to start is to ask: What did you do during the war? How have you changed since it ended? Did you choose the path you’re on, or were you designed for it? Chapter 6 includes two new subclasses that a warforged could explore. The Warrior of the Living Weapon Monk could be a warforged whose abilities reflect physical evolution combined with martial discipline. The Circle of the Forged is a Druid subclass that lets you explore your connection to the natural world while remaining a creature of wood and stone. Here are a few other unusual concepts.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheDivineTool">The Divine Tool</h4>

  <p>You were made by human hands. There are many who believe that you have no soul, that you’re just a tool. What would draw you to a religion and imbue you with the faith required to channel divine magic? If you’re creating a warforged Paladin or Cleric, here are a few ideas to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Onatar is the Sovereign of the Forge, the patron of the smith and artificer. As a Forge Domain Cleric (from <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/XGtE">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a>), you might believe that the warforged weren’t designed by a mortal mind; rather, Aaren d’Cannith was guided by divine inspiration to bring Onatar’s children into the world. Do you want to bring humans and warforged together, promoting a peaceful coexistence? Or do you believe that the warforged have their own divine purpose that has yet to be fulfilled?
    </li>
    <li>
      An artificer built fifteen warforged, each to serve as an avatar for one of the Sovereigns and Six. Did they succeed? You wield divine magic; is there the seed of a Sovereign within you, waiting to grow as you gain levels? Which Sovereign do you represent? And if the experiment appears to have worked, what became of your fourteen siblings?
    </li>
    <li>
      You have the body of a warforged but the mind of a human. You were a devoted follower of the Blood of Vol. After death, you awoke in a warforged body. You don’t know how this happened. Was it an accident? The work of a necromancer? Or are all warforged vessels for dormant ghosts? Regardless, you intend to use this second life to fight for the living.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any noble soul can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to protect the innocent. Were you inspired by a paladin who fought by your side, and you took up their sword when they fell in battle? Or perhaps you were <em>designed</em> to channel the power of the Flame—a prototype commissioned by one of the Cardinals of Thrane. Are you a miracle, a celebrated champion of the church with the Acolyte background? Or has Cardinal Krozen branded you an abomination?
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheDocentWarlock">The Docent Warlock</h4>

  <p>A [magicitems]Docent[/magicitems] is a sentient magic item, a sphere that attaches to the chest of a warforged and offers guidance. Ancient <em>Docents</em> have been found in Xen’drik, artifacts of unknown age and origin. You found such a <em>Docent</em> and it’s attached to your body, altering your physiology and gifting you with supernatural powers. Mechanically you’re a Warlock, but you wear your patron on your chest. The patron you choose reveals something about the nature of the <em>Docent</em>. If you take the Fiend Patron, it suggests that a dark power could be bound in the <em>Docent</em>. If you take the Celestial Patron, perhaps the <em>Docent</em> holds a spirit of light. The <em>Docent</em> is the source of your powers, but you don’t know if you can trust it; discovering the true nature of the <em>Docent</em> will be part of your unfolding story. Is it a magic item created by a forgotten society? Or is an immortal spirit bound within the <em>Docent</em>... and if so, what does it want?</p>
  <p>While the story idea is that you found a <em>Docent</em>, your patron doesn’t use an Attunement slot and you can’t actually remove it; it’s become a part of you. However, if you do somehow remove it, you won’t lose the powers you already possess. Should this happen, perhaps you’ll have to find a new patron, or perhaps you’ll find that the power was a part of you all along.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheForgottenAssassin">The Forgotten Assassin</h4>

  <p>You awoke in the bottom of a lake. You have no memory of how you got there or anything of your life before that moment. As Warforged don’t need to breathe, you made your way back to shore. You’re a Rogue, quick and deadly. But you have flashes of your past, glimpses of memory in which you’re an assassin possessing far greater skills than you have today. As you gain levels, you are actually regaining these skills you once possessed. As you do so, perhaps you’ll also recover your memory. Who did you work for? Who did you kill? How and why was your memory wiped? And most of all, are you sure you want to know the answer?</p>
