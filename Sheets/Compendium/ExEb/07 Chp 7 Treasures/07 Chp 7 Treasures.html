<h1 class="compendium-hr">Chapter 7: Treasures</h1>

<div id="_idContainer024">
    <p>What is it?” Ban asked, carefully <br/> studying the ancient gauntlet. Pulling out her Duster, Dela passed the wand over the relic. Centuries of grime vanished, revealing blackened steel and glittering Khyber dragonshards. “The Hand of Halas Tarkanan. It’s a weapon made to amplify the power of aberrant dragonmarks.” She touched one of the embedded shards. “This gauntlet once leveled the towers of Sharn. And in the wrong hands, it could do so again.”</p>
    <p>Magic is an important part of everyday life in Eberron. Magic items aren’t simply treasures or relics of a forgotten age; they’re modern-day tools of industry and weapons of war. This section presents a range of magic items and other treasures, from the focus items of the dragonmarked houses to the living symbionts of the daelkyr. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the rules on using magic items.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Common Magic Items</h2>

    <p>Magic is used in a multitude of minor ways that may have little impact on adventurers, but improve everyday life for common folk. Xanathar’s Guide to Everything and Eberron: Rising from the Last War present a number of Common magic items, all of which can be found in Khorvaire. This section adds a number of additional items, but these are just the tip of the iceberg. Use these as a source of inspiration for what can be done, not as an absolute list of the only magic items found in Eberron.</p>
    <p>Cantrips are a source of inspiration for Common magic items, though most only replicate a portion of a cantrip’s effects. Consider Clothes of Mending, which automatically mend themselves. The Cleansing Stone, Duster, and Armor of Gleaming all employ the cleaning aspect of Prestidigitation, while the Talking Wand provides the voice amplification effect of Thaumaturgy. Cleaning, heating, chilling, mending, creating illusory sounds or images—all are tools in the Cannith arsenal.</p>
    <p>While most Common magic items have no impact on combat, a few items have practical value. The Battle Rod and War Staff increase the range of cantrips, while the Armblade and Integrated Tool provide minor benefits for warforged characters. As a DM, you can choose to combine a Common magic item’s benefits with a more powerful magic item. For example, the extended range of a Common War Staff could be applied to a Staff of Fire, or a warforged Armblade could wield a Sun Blade.</p>
    <p>Battle Rod</p>
    <p>Rod, Common</p>
    <p>The Battle Rod was developed as an alternative to the longer War Staff, and has gained popularity with wandslingers across Khorvaire. When held in two hands, you can use the rod to cast cantrips at up to twice the standard range. However, when you cast a cantrip beyond the standard range, your attack rolls have Disadvantage, and targets have Advantage on saving throws made against your cantrip. For example, a Fire Bolt cast using this rod has a range of 240 feet, but attack rolls against targets more than 120 feet away are made at Disadvantage.</p>
    <p>Charlatan&apos;s Gloves</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>While wearing these gloves, you can take a Magic action to produce an illusory image that fits in the palm of your hand. The image lasts for 1 minute or until your Concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
    <p>If a creature takes a Study action to examine the image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
    <p>Drybrooch</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>While holding or wearing this item, you can take a Magic action to summon or dismiss a dome of energy that manifests just above your head. This energy repels moderate quantities of frozen and liquid water, such as rain, snow, bird droppings, or other similar nuisances, but can’t be used to protect against harsh environmental hazards or attacks. The energy field is typically silvery and translucent. More expensive models have illusions woven into the field; one popular version creates the image of a sunny blue sky overhead.</p>
    <p>Duster</p>
    <p>Wand, Common</p>
    <p>While holding this wand, you can take a Magic action to instantly clean an area within 10 feet of you that is no larger than 1 cubic foot, removing dirt and grime. There are many variations of the Duster; the two-handed Staff of Cleansing covers a five-foot cube with a single Magic action, while the Bright Basin cleans clothing and cloth objects placed within it.</p>
    <p>Integrated Tool</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common (Requires Use by a Warforged)</p>
    <p>This item attaches to the body of a warforged, and is designed to serve as one of the following tools that weighs 10 pounds or less: an Artisan’s Tool, Forgery Kit, Herbalism Kit, Poisoner’s Kit, Thieves’ Tools, or a Musical Instrument.</p>
    <p>You must incorporate the tool into your body before you can use it. Over the course of 1 hour, you can attach the tool or remove it from your body, remaining in contact with it for the whole hour; this can be done over a Short or Long Rest.</p>
    <p>While you’re alive, the tool can’t be removed from your body against your will. Though the tool has become part of your body, you must still have a hand free to make use of it. You can only have one Integrated Tool attached to your body at a time.</p>
    <p>Warforged and Prosthetic Limbs</p>
    <p>Eberron: Rising from the Last War introduces the Prosthetic Limb, a Common magic item requiring Attunement which predates the warforged. Prosthetic Limbs come in many forms; one might resemble an organic limb of animated wood, and another could be a metal shell or a construct of force. During the Last War, Karrnath made use of skeletal prosthetics, and more recently, Cannith and Jorasco have produced prosthetics that use the same semiorganic materials as the warforged.</p>
    <p>Eberron: Rising from the Last War also includes two magic items designed to integrate into a Warforged’s forearm: the Armblade and the Wand Sheath. At the DM’s discretion, a character of a different species might be able to integrate one of these warforged items into their Prosthetic Limb; the question is if the two can logically work together, or if the style of your prosthetic makes it implausible that it could mesh with a warforged component. If the DM decides it’s possible to integrate a component item with the prosthetic, the two could be counted as a single magic item for the purpose of determining the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the component from the prosthetic, you immediately lose your Attunement to the component.</p>
    <p>Lamplighter</p>
    <p>Wand, Common</p>
    <p>While you are holding this wand, you can take a Magic action to instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, torch, small campfire, or similar source of flame within 10 feet of you.</p>
    <p>Spark</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>This small oval stone is engraved with Fernian glyphs. While you are holding the stone, you can take a Bonus Action to touch a candle, torch, small campfire, or similar object, instantly igniting it into flame.</p>
    <p>Talking Wand</p>
    <p>Wand, Common</p>
    <p>While you are holding this wand, your voice and other sounds you produce are three times as loud as normal. House Phiarlan makes use of a similar device, the Thunderous Amulet, that leaves the wearer’s hands free.</p>
    <p>Thurimbar Rod</p>
    <p>Musical Instrument, Common</p>
    <p>This rod is a magical Musical Instrument developed by the gnomes of Zilargo. While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to produce auditory illusions that unerringly replicate the sound of any instrument with which you’re proficient, with an effect similar to the Minor Illusion spell, with the sound emanating from the rod. To determine the quality of the performance, make a Charisma check with the Musical Instrument you’re replicating. If you are proficient with the Thurimbar Rod, you can produce unearthly music unlike any natural instrument.</p>
    <p>War Staff</p>
    <p>Staff, Common (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)</p>
    <p>Aundair developed this staff to help wandslingers match the range of Thrane archers, but it quickly spread across Khorvaire. While holding this staff in both hands, you can use it as an Arcane Focus. Any cantrip cast using the staff can be cast at up to four times the standard range. However, when you cast a cantrip at more than twice the standard range, your attack rolls have Disadvantage, and targets have Advantage on saving throws made against your cantrip. For example, a Fire Bolt cast using this staff has a range of 480 feet, but attack rolls against targets more than 240 feet away are made at Disadvantage.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Magic Items</h2>

    <p>Though the Empire of Dhakaan has no tradition of arcane artillery, the sages of the Kech Volaar are carefully studying the tools and techniques of the Five Nations, working to grasp the principles of the evoker and the conjurer. But while wands and Siege Staffs aren’t yet part of the Dhakaani arsenal, their daashor artificers are exceptionally talented. The Dhakaani have mastered techniques of metallurgy and smithing that Cannith has yet to learn. They know techniques for refining and working adamantine alloys and other exotic metals, and for binding arcane energies into their creations. In ancient times, the empire produced many mighty artifacts. DMs will have to decide whether the present-day Dhakaani still have the ability to craft new artifacts, or if their greatest secrets were lost in the collapse of the empire.</p>
    <p>This section describes a few unique Dhakaani relics that might be found across Khorvaire. Typically these are found in ancient tombs and ruins; such treasures as Adamantine Armor are immune to the ravages of time. However, the Heirs of Dhakaan continue to craft fine weapons and armor, and Dhakaani champions are well equipped.</p>
    <p>The daashor value function over fashion. Their tools and weapons are impeccably designed, but typically austere in form: blackened adamantine or steel, with emblems of clan and empire woven unobtrusively into the design. In addition to Adamantine Weapons, Dhakaani may produce any sort of magical arms or armor. Armor of Invulnerability, Armor of Resistance, Defender weapons, Mace of Terror—any of these could be Dhakaani designs. While the Dhakaani use swords, bows, and spears, their champions often field flails, maces, and mauls. Other Dhakaani magic items are usually focused on battlefield use. For example, magical banners or instruments could inspire allies or instill fear in enemies.</p>
    <p>The Heirs of Dhakaan seek to recover Dhakaani Artifacts and Legendary items, and they’ll try to claim these most valuable items from other creatures through force or diplomacy. While it may disturb a warrior of Dhakaan to see a human wearing Dhakaani armor or carrying an adamantine blade from an imperial forge, they don’t need to recover every relic of the past, and they may allow this to pass without incident.</p>
    <p>Breastplate of Kamvuul Norek</p>
    <p>Armor (Breastplate), Legendary (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This adamantine Breastplate of ancient Dhaakan belonged to a hobgoblin hero known as a mighty slayer of Aberrations.</p>
    <p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit, and you have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
    <p>Additionally, if you succeed on a saving throw against the Mind Blast ability of a Mind Flayer or other Aberration, you are unaffected, and the effect is reflected back toward the Aberration as if the cone originated from you, including the Aberration in its area of effect.</p>
    <p>Ghaal&apos;duur, the Mighty Dirge</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement by a Bard)</p>
    <p>This three-foot warhorn, a revered artifact of Dhakaan, is carved from the tip of a red dragon’s horn, banded with adamantine, and covered with runes of power. An inscription in Goblin reads “A mighty dirge for the fallen foe.” Ghaal’duur was crafted by Jhazaal Dhakaan, a legendary dirge singer who united the ancient warring clans. Any kech warlord who obtained it would gain great influence among the Heirs of Dhakaan—and any non-Dhakaani that possesses it bears a dangerous burden.</p>
    <p>Random Properties. The warhorn has the following random properties (see “Artifacts” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide):</p>
    <ul>
            <li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
            <li>1 minor detrimental property; any goblinoid attuned to the warhorn is immune to the detrimental effects of this property.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jhazaal’s Presence. While you are attuned to the warhorn, your Charisma increases by 4, to a maximum of 24.</p>
    <p>The Dragon’s Song. When holding the warhorn in both hands, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells. Bard spells cast using the warhorn gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, its duration is doubled, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</li>
            <li>If the spell has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range is doubled.</li>
            <li>If the spell is 1st level or higher, it is cast as if from a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell slot you expended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Sound of Victory. While holding the warhorn in both hands, you can take a Magic action to blow it, empowering your allies and intimidating your foes. For the next 10 minutes, any time an ally within 600 feet of you that can hear you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it adds 1d4 to the attack roll or save. If the creature is a goblinoid, it adds 2d4 instead of 1d4.</p>
    <p>Additionally, every enemy within 600 feet of you that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw against your Bard spell save DC. For the next 10 minutes, whenever a target that fails this save makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must subtract 1d4 from the attack roll or save. If the target is a goblinoid, it subtracts 2d4 instead of 1d4.</p>
    <p>Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>
    <p>Destroying the Horn. It’s said that only the fire of Jharaashta, the dragon who sacrificed his horn for its creation, can destroy the horn. But after nine thousand years, most sages assume that the mighty dragon is long dead.</p>
    <p>Grieving Tree</p>
    <p>Eldritch Machine (Requires Attunement Using Lost Techniques)</p>
    <p>A Grieving Tree is a giant skeletal tree made of the purest white marble, weighing thousands of pounds. One of the greatest inventions of the daashor Taruuzh, a Grieving Tree is part execution device and part torture device; a nearly inescapable prison that sustains victims on the very edge of death. The secrets to the tree’s construction were lost with Taruuzh’s death, as was the art of controlling them. To attune to a Grieving Tree, a character will have to rediscover these forgotten techniques.</p>
    <p>Lingering Life. The tree has a pool of Hit Points. The pool starts at 20 Hit Points, and gains Hit Points whenever the tree uses its Eviscerate ability, to a maximum of 200 Hit Points. As long as there are Hit Points in this pool, whenever an imprisoned creature drops to 0 Hit Points but is still alive, that creature is healed 1d4 + 1 Hit Points and the same amount is subtracted from the pool.</p>
    <p>Prisoners of the Tree. The tree can hold up to four creatures (or their corpses) at a time. A creature that is within 5 feet of a prisoner can attempt to free it from the tree by making a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the prisoner is freed, and both creatures take 3d6 Piercing damage. On a failure, the prisoner remains in the tree, and both creatures take the Piercing damage.</p>
    <p>Tree Control. While attuned to the tree and within 120 feet of it, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <p>Grab. You can take a Magic action to target a creature within 20 feet of the tree. The target must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw as the tree reaches down to snare them. On a failed save, the tree captures the target within its branches. The target takes 6d6 Piercing damage, and has the Stunned condition until it’s released from the tree.</p>
    <p>Eviscerate. You can take a Magic action to command the tree to eviscerate its unfortunate prisoners, draining their life and blood as the branches shake and quiver. All creatures Stunned by the tree take 8d6 Piercing damage, and half of the total damage dealt is added to the tree’s Lingering Life pool.</p>
    <p>Answer for Their Crimes. You can take a Magic action to cast Speak with Dead on the corpse of a creature imprisoned in the tree, without expending a spell slot or requiring Material components. When you cast the spell in this manner, the corpse is compelled to speak truthfully.</p>
    <p>Release a Prisoner. You can take a Bonus Action to command the tree to release one of its prisoners.</p>
    <p>Keeper&apos;s Fang</p>
    <p>Weapon (Dagger), Rare</p>
    <p>These infamous weapons, prized by assassins, have a Khyber dragonshard embedded into the pommel that channels the souls of victims, but doesn’t itself trap them. There’s much debate over the actual fate of the souls of those slain by a Keeper’s Fang. Common myth says that the souls of victims are trapped in the Lair of the Keeper, and heroes can seek to reclaim a soul from the Sovereign of Death and Decay. Another myth maintains that these weapons channel souls to the overlord Katashka, and that one must deal with the Lords of Dust to restore a victim. Most Keeper’s Fangs were created by the Shaarat’khesh assassins of the Empire of Dhakaan. Rather than ascribing the blade’s power to the Keeper--whose existence the Dhakaani reject--they believe these blades utterly destroy the souls of their victims.</p>
    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, the creature is slain and its soul removed. A creature whose soul has been stolen in this way can be restored to life only by means of a Wish spell.</p>
    <p>Byeshk Weapons</p>
    <p>Byeshk is a rare and heavy metal of lustrous purple, mined from the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains along Droaam’s borders. It can also be found in the Ironlands, a Khyberian demiplane that’s been delved into by the Ghaash’kala and Kech Shaarat (discussed in chapters 4 and 5). Aberrations tied to the daelkyr—including Dolgaunts, Dolgrims, and Mind Flayers—are susceptible to weapons made of byeshk alloys, making the metal highly valued to the Dhakaani, Gatekeepers druids, and others that fight Aberrations. Dhakaani weapons forged during the Xoriat Incursion were often forged from byeshk.</p>
    <p>Melee weapons made of or coated with byeshk are not inherently magical weapons, but are unusually effective when used to fight Aberrations. Whenever you hit an Aberration with a byeshk weapon, the Aberration takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type, and it can’t regain Hit Points until the start of your next turn.</p>
    <p>The byeshk version of a Melee weapon costs 400 GP more than the normal version, whether the weapon is made of the metal or coated with it.</p>
    <p>Shaarat&apos;doovol, the Blade of Truth</p>
    <p>Weapon (Longsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This blade was forged in khaar’draguus, the lava pits below Sharn, and wielded by an ancient Dhakaani hero who fell in battle against the daelkyr Belashyrra. A sentience lies within the blade; it doesn’t communicate with words, but while attuned, you can feel its emotions and desires. Shaarat’doovol was forged to protect the innocent from the machinations of the daelkyr, and if it feels you are serving that purpose, it can grant great power.</p>
    <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an Aberration with this weapon, the Aberration takes an extra 2d10 Radiant damage.</p>
    <p>Unyielding Duty. If you have the favor of the sword, it guides you and shields you from unnatural influences. While wielding this sword, it can choose to grant you the following benefits:</p>
    <p>Truesight. You gain Truesight with a range of 90 feet.</p>
    <p>Fortified Mind. You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage.</p>
    <p>Uul&apos;kur (Dream Key)</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>This iron token is inlaid with a sliver of a Siberys dragonshard. Most are worn as brooches, but others take the form of coins or keys. While an Uul’kur is a Common magic item, the secret of their creation is known only to the chot’uul monks of the Heirs of Dhakaan, and they are largely unknown in the Five Nations.</p>
    <p>When you sleep with an Uul’kur on your person, you remain fully lucid when you dream, and when you wake, you clearly remember everything that transpired. If you understand the workings of the Uul’kur, you can take a Magic action to bind it to your dreams until the next dawn. While bound, any creature who sleeps with this token on its person shares your dream instead of creating its own, provided you are asleep at the same time.</p>
    <p>Vola&apos;khesh</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>This small carved stone is typically bound to a leather strap worn around the wrist or neck. Designed by the Dhakaani duur’kala, the Vola’khesh facilitates communication between elite units. They are created in linked sets; up to ten stones can be bound together, and once established, this link cannot be changed. At present, the Vola’khesh are only used by the Kech Dhakaan and are unknown to the people of the Five Nations. If the enchantments were replicated, these tools could be put into use by spies and law enforcement agencies of the Five Nations.</p>
    <p>While wearing a Vola’khesh, you can take a Bonus Action to whisper a message. This message is heard by all creatures within 120 feet wearing a linked Vola’khesh. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood will block this effect, but the magic doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Dragonmark Focus Items</h2>

    <p>Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it’s easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren’t overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases—such as the Storm Spires of House Lyrandar and the Creation Forges of House Cannith—the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.</p>
    <p>This chapter provides several new dragonmark focus items. In addition, you could have a dragonmark focus item that produces the same effect as an existing magic item from the Dungeon Master’s Guide—except it can’t be used or attuned unless you possess a particular dragonmark. House Lyrandar is working on a version of a Broom of Flying for dragonmarked heirs, though they haven’t perfected it yet. House Ghallanda is developing a Portable Inn—a version of the Instant Fortress—but it’s proven difficult. It’s always up to the DM to decide if there’s a dragonmark focus item that replicates the effects of any given magic item, and if so, how readily it’s available.</p>
    <p>The Dragonmark Focus Items table provides examples of focus items, along with the item whose effects they reproduce and the mark required to use or attune to the focus item. A focus item’s rarity is generally less than a similar item that anyone can use, reflecting the relative ease of manufacture. However, this doesn’t mean they are readily available; dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear Medi Spectacles, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold.</p>
    <p>While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item, and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item’s design can differ from the usual magic item’s form—the Serpentine Mirror has a similar effect to a Crystal Ball, but it’s a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.</p>
    <p>Channeling Wand</p>
    <p>Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Creature with a Specific Dragonmark)</p>
    <p>This short metal wand is tipped with a Siberys dragonshard. Each Channeling Wand is tied to a specific dragonmark, such as the Mark of Healing or the Mark of Making, and you can only attune to it if you possess that dragonmark.</p>
    <p>A Channeling Wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can cast any spell on your Spells of the Mark list, expending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell you cast. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is the same as the spellcasting ability for the other spells you can cast using your Dragonmark feat. You can expend additional charges to enhance the spell, choosing one of the following effects:</p>
    <p>Casting Time. You expend 2 charges to change a spell that normally has a casting time of 1 Magic action to instead be cast as a Bonus Action.</p>
    <p>Duration. You expend 1 charge to double the duration of the spell, to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Range. You expend 1 charge to double the range of the spell. If the spell normally has a range of Touch, you can cast it with a range of 30 feet.</p>
    <p>Regaining Charges. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>
    <p>Dragonmark Channel</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common (Requires Attunement by a Creature with a Specific Dragonmark)</p>
    <p>This brooch is embedded with a small Siberys dragonshard, usually depicting the crest of its dragonmarked house. Each Dragonmark Channel is tied to a specific dragonmark, such as the Mark of Healing or the Mark of Making, and you can only attune to it if you possess that dragonmark.</p>
    <p>While wearing a Dragonmark Channel, you can use it to cast any level 1 spell on your Spells of the Mark list. Once you use the channel, it can’t be used again until you finish a Long Rest. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is the same as the spellcasting ability for the spells you can cast with your Dragonmark feat.</p>
    <p>Dragonmark Reservoir</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Creature with a Specific Dragonmark)</p>
    <p>Dragonmark Reservoirs are always embedded with a Siberys dragonshard, but come in many forms, most commonly an amulet or bracelet bearing the design of the house crest. Each reservoir is tied to a specific dragonmark, such as the Mark of Healing or the Mark of Making, and you can only attune to it if you possess that dragonmark.</p>
    <p>A Dragonmark Reservoir has 7 charges. While wearing it, you can use it to cast any spell on your Spells of the Mark list at 1st or 2nd level, expending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell you cast. The reservoir regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is the same as the spellcasting ability for the spells you can cast with your Dragonmark feat.</p>
    <p>Ghallanda Cauldron</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common (Requires Attunement by a Creature with the Mark of Hospitality)</p>
    <p>Engraved with arcane sigils and imbued with ground Siberys shards, this cauldron allows you to prepare food in the blink of an eye. While you have to provide the raw materials, a Ghallanda Cauldron can mystically heat, chill, or flavor contents, allowing precise control over temperature and replicating the flavor of spices or herbs you don’t possess. While cooking food in the cauldron, you can reduce its cooking time by 90%, and you gain Advantage on ability checks made using Cook’s Utensils.</p>
    <p>Helm of the Sentinel</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Creature with the Mark of Sentinel)</p>
    <p>This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use any of its properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <p>Counterspell. You can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and establish a defensive ward with a contingent Counterspell. The next time you can see an unfriendly creature within 60 feet of you casting any spell that either targets you or causes you to make a saving throw, the Counterspell immediately takes effect whether or not you want it to, as if you had cast it using your Reaction. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. The ward ends immediately after Counterspell takes effect or at the next dawn.</p>
    <p>Protection. You can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and cast Protection from Energy on yourself.</p>
    <p>Deflection Field. You can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 charge and cast Shield of Faith on yourself.</p>
    <p>Houseward</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Wards 2,500 Square Feet), Rare (Wards 5,000 Square Feet), Legendary (Wards 10,000 Square Feet)</p>
    <p>This engraved block of lead, approximately 1 cubic foot in size, holds an embedded Siberys dragonshard. The Houseward provides state-of-the-art magical security, and is typically embedded into the floor of the building it is supposed to protect. If any creature with the Mark of Warding spends 10 minutes touching the Houseward, it can cast Guards and Wards without requiring Material components. The area protected by the spell is determined by the rarity of the Houseward. The duration of the spell is 24 days, but the effect ends early if the Houseward is used again to cast the spell, if a creature with the Mark of Warding spends 10 minutes touching the Houseward to end its effects, or if a Houseward is removed from the area it is currently protecting. After being used to cast the spell, the Houseward can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p>
    <p>Manor Key</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires the Mark of Hospitality)</p>
    <p>This long key, studded with tiny Siberys dragonshards, can only be used by a creature with the Mark of Hospitality. You can take a Magic action to trace the outline of a door in the air with the key and cast Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion without requiring Material components. The spell ends after 24 hours or when you use the key to lock the door and dismiss the effect; at that time, any creatures within the mansion are expelled into an open space near its entrance. Once used, the key cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
    <p>Prospector&apos;s Wand</p>
    <p>Wand, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Creature with the Mark of Finding)</p>
    <p>This Y-shaped wand, bearing the emblem of the Mark of Finding, has 5 charges. While holding the wand, you can use any of its properties:</p>
    <p>Finding. You can expend 2 charges to cast Locate Creature from it.</p>
    <p>Location. You can expend 1 charge to cast Locate Object from it.</p>
    <p>Prospecting. You can expend 1 charge to cast Locate Animals or Plants from it, with the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
            <li>You can describe or name a specific kind of mineral and locate it instead of a Beast or Plant.</li>
            <li>You can specify the minimum quantity of that Beast, Plant, or mineral that you wish the spell to find within a 30-foot-radius sphere, such as “at least 3 pounds of Eberron dragonshards” or “at least five deer.” You learn the direction and distance to the closest occurrence in that concentration, if any are present.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regaining Charges. The wand regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>
    <p>Rod of Wild Dominion</p>
    <p>Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Creature with the Mark of Handling)</p>
    <p>This rod of varnished oak is capped at both ends with a Siberys dragonshard. While holding the rod, you can use any of its properties:</p>
    <p>Dominion. You can cast Dominate Beast from the rod. When you cast the spell in this manner, the duration increases to up to 1 hour. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. After the rod is used to cast this spell, it can’t be used to do so again until the next dawn.</p>
    <p>Handling. You have Advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Wisdom (Survival) checks.</p>
    <p>Wild Speech. You can cast Speak with Animals from the rod.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Miscellaneous Magic Items</h2>

    <p>This section presents a few items that use magic readily accessible to the skilled artificers of Eberron. The Aereni Mask would generally only be crafted on the island of Aerenal, and only given to worthy Aereni elves. The rest might be purchased in the major cities of Khorvaire, though they might have limited quantities or require you to find an artifice willing to take a special commission.</p>
    <p>Aereni Mask</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Worthy Bearer)</p>
    <p>This mask’s intricate design links it to one of the Aereni noble lines, and the guidance it offers comes from spirits of that line. You can’t attune to the mask unless those spirits judge you worthy to wear it.</p>
    <p>An Aereni Mask is imbued with two skills when it is created. While wearing the mask, when you make an ability check using either of those skills, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.</p>
    <p>Bane Weapon</p>
    <p>Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one of the following creature types: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Dragon, Fiend, Giant, or Undead.</p>
    <p>The weapon has 4 charges. If you hit a creature of the chosen type with the weapon, you can expend 1 charge and inflict an additional 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type with the attack. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <p>Final Messenger</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires use by a Warforged)</p>
    <p>A delicate winged creature, this homunculus was designed to facilitate communication between warforged soldiers during the Last War. A Final Messenger is a Tiny Construct with an AC of 20, 6 Hit Points, and a Fly Speed of 60 feet. It has Immunity to Poison damage and Psychic damage, and all conditions other than Unconsciousness. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). It has Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. It has no limbs and the only action it can take on its turn is the Dash action.</p>
    <p>If you are a warforged, you can take a Magic action to integrate a Final Messenger into your body. While it is part of your body, the messenger cannot be targeted by any attack. You can only have one messenger attached to your body at a time. A messenger can only remain active for 8 hours after it detaches from a warforged body, after which time its energy dissipates and it gains the Unconscious condition. An Unconscious messenger must complete a Short or Long Rest while attached to a warforged, after which it regains its energy, as well as regaining all lost Hit Points.</p>
    <p>A Final Messenger holds four pieces of data, accessible only to the warforged it is attached to. While the messenger is attached to you, you can take a Magic action to review the data currently stored within the messenger, and if you choose to, change any or all of these data points.</p>
    <ul>
            <li>A destination for the messenger. This can be very specific (a particular apartment in Sharn) or more general (an open marketplace).</li>
            <li>A target individual. This could be a specific person or a category (“Any Karrnathi warforged”).</li>
            <li>A single image recorded through the eyes of a warforged attached to the messenger.</li>
            <li>A message of up to 25 words.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can release the messenger as a Bonus Action, at which point it flies to its destination by the most direct route possible. Once it reaches the destination it seeks the target individual; if no target has been set, it approaches the nearest warforged.</p>
    <p>If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points while a Final Messenger is attached to you, it immediately detaches and seeks out its target. It retains its stored message, but replaces its stored image with the last thing you saw before dropping to 0 Hit Points.</p>
    <p>Gloves of Storing</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</p>
    <p>These gloves come in pairs, each one tied to a small pocket dimension. The gloves’ weight is negligible, regardless of their contents. While wearing the gloves, and holding an object that weighs no more than 20 pounds and can be held in one hand, you can take a Bonus Action to store that object inside the glove’s extradimensional space. When an object is stored inside the extradimensional space, you can take a Bonus Action to summon it back into your empty hand. You can only store a single object in each glove’s extradimensional space, for a total of two items between the pair.</p>
    <p>If a glove is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.</p>
    <p>Placing the gloves inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.</p>
    <p>Quiver of Energy</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</p>
    <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, choose one of the following damage types: Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. The first time each turn that you hit a target with a weapon attack using ammunition drawn from this quiver, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type.</p>
    <p>Resistance Breaker</p>
    <p>Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare</p>
    <p>This magic weapon has 5 charges. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend 1 of the weapon’s charges to negate all of the creature’s Resistances to damage until the end of your next turn. The weapon regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <p>Silent Weapon</p>
    <p>Weapon (Any Ranged Weapon), Uncommon</p>
    <p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a Ranged weapon attack made with this weapon, making the attack doesn’t reveal your position.</p>
    <p>Soarsled</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</p>
    <p>A soarsled is a crystalline disk 5 feet in diameter. It can carry a passenger through the air, using the same principles as the buttresses that sustain the towers of Sharn.</p>
    <p>While within Sharn or another Syranian manifest zone, you can stand on the sled and take a Magic action to mentally activate it, causing it to hover beneath you. Once per turn, you can mentally command the hovering sled to move up to 30 feet in any direction. The sled can carry up to 400 pounds, and stops hovering when you step off it.</p>
    <p>Each turn, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, moving the sled up to an additional 60 feet on a success.</p>
    <p>While outside a Syranian manifest zone, the plane’s energies rapidly fade, and the Soarsled can only be activated once, by taking a Magic action. When it has been used to fly for a total of 10 minutes, or when you deactivate it by stepping off it, it loses its energy and can’t be used again until it spends at least 8 hours in a Syranian manifest zone.</p>
    <p>Tools of the Master</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item (Any Artisan’s Tool), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very Rare (+3) (Requires Attunement by a Character Proficient with the Tool)</p>
    <p>While using this tool as a Spellcasting Focus, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls. The bonus is determined by the tool’s rarity. In addition, you can add this bonus to any ability check you make using this tool.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Symbionts</h2>

    <p>The daelkyr create living tools and weapons, objects formed from chitin, bone, and muscle. Many of these items bond to their bearer, drawing sustenance from the creature attuned to them; for this reason, they are commonly called “symbionts.” Though symbionts are living tools, they are mechanically considered a magic item, not a creature.</p>
    <p>This section introduces eight new symbiont items, like those in chapter 5 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. In addition, you could present any existing magic item as a daelkyr-made symbiont by describing the item as being made from organic materials. A Dagger of Venom crafted by Valaara could be a chitin blade that’s warm to the touch. A Cloak of the Bat might feel like membranous leather, with veins running through the material. A Periapt of Wound Closure could be a scarab that burrows into the flesh of the bearer, enhancing their blood. Even Common magic items can be symbionts; an Everbright Lantern could be a sluglike creature with a luminescent body.</p>
    <p>When presenting an existing item as a symbiont, the DM must decide whether to add the Symbiotic Nature feature that other symbionts have. When such an item is attuned, it can’t be removed from the bearer, even if they desire it; the only way to end the Attunement and remove a symbiont is to use an effect that ends a curse. This prevents the item from being taken away, but limits a character’s free will, so it’s up to the story you want to tell. While Symbiotic Nature is a common attribute for symbionts, it’s not a requirement. A slug that functions as an Everbright Lantern wouldn’t require Attunement. Even if the Periapt of Wound Closure is a scarab that digs into the flesh of the bearer, perhaps it could be pried loose, or it might release its grip voluntarily if the bearer ends the Attunement.</p>
    <p>Crawling Gauntlet</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>Crafted by the daelkyr, this gauntlet appears to be the forearm of a monstrous humanoid. When you attune to it, it surrounds your hand and forearm, fusing to your flesh.</p>
    <p>When you make an Unarmed Strike, you can slash with the talons on the gauntlet. On a hit, you can deal Slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.</p>
    <p>Additionally, you can project an ectoplasmic duplicate of the gauntlet, allowing you to manipulate objects at a distance. While wearing this gauntlet, you can take a Magic action to cast Mage Hand from it.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Coat of Many Eyes</p>
    <p>Armor (Studded Leather); Uncommon, Rare, or Very Rare (Evolves with Service to Belashyrra, Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This armor is a creation of the daelkyr Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes. Made from a tough, leathery material, the coat is warm to the touch and covered with eyes—eyes of many different types of creatures, constantly glancing around as it studies your surroundings. When you attune to the armor, it binds itself to your flesh and shares its insight, granting the following benefits:</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</p>
    <p>Eyes Everywhere. The armor lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
    <p>Gifts of the All-Seer. All Coats of Many Eyes are linked to Belashyrra, and while wearing one you may receive visions— flashes of things the Lord of Eyes wishes to see through you. If you follow through with these tasks, your armor can evolve, gaining additional powers and increasing its effective rarity.</p>
    <p>Rare. A rare coat also grants you a +1 bonus to AC and allows you to see Invisible creatures and objects within 120 feet.</p>
    <p>Very Rare. A very rare coat also grants you a +1 bonus to AC and allows you to see Invisible creatures and objects within 120 feet. Additionally, you can take a Magic action to cast Arcane Eye with it. Once you cast the spell in this manner, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Hungry Weapon</p>
    <p>Weapon (Any Melee), Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>A creation of the daelkyr, this weapon is formed from muscle and bone. It may moan, growl, or wail, and it twists in your grip if it doesn’t like you. If any creature attempts to wield this weapon while not attuned to it, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls made using the weapon. Additionally, if you are attuned to this weapon when another creature tries to wield it, the weapon’s hilt extrudes sharp thorns and that creature takes 1d4 Piercing damage each turn.</p>
    <p>While attuned to and wielding this weapon, you can take a Bonus Action to bond to it, causing tendrils from the hilt of the weapon to burrow into your flesh. You can end the weapon’s bond as a Magic action, causing the tendrils to retract so you can release the weapon. You can remain attuned to the weapon regardless of whether you’re bonded to it. While bonded to it, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <p>Secure Grip. The weapon is bound to your hand and can’t be removed from your grasp, voluntarily or involuntarily. If it’s a Two-Handed weapon, only one of your hands is bound to the weapon.</p>
    <p>Drain Life. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to expend one Hit Die to deal additional damage with the attack, and as you do, drain the life from your foes. Roll the Hit Die and add your Constitution modifier; the attack deals extra Necrotic damage equal to the result, and you <br/> regain an equal number of Hit Points.</p>
    <p>Shadow Sibling</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>Crafted by Dyrrn the Corruptor, this black jewel-like object fuses to the center of your forehead when you attune to it. As a Bonus Action, you can cause the sibling to exude or retract an ectoplasmic shadow that surrounds your body and conceals you from prying eyes. While the shadow is active, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have Disadvantage, and you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to Hide.</p>
    <p>In addition, when you are hit by an attack, you can take a Reaction to expend one Hit Die to shield yourself. Roll the die and add the result to your AC, including against the triggering attack. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Spellburrow</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>These scarab-like symbionts, bred by the daelkyr Valaara, have brilliant, iridescent shells. To attune to it, you must place it on your head; during the process of Attunement, it burrows through your skull, establishing a psychic connection with you. While it lacks human consciousness, it possesses a strange alien sentience that responds to your desires. There are tales of rare Spellburrows that possess greater knowledge and sentience; such stories sometimes end with the Spellburrow consuming the brain of the wizard who pushed it too far—but these are surely just fanciful stories!</p>
    <p>A Spellburrow knows one cantrip of the DM’s choice drawn from the Sorcerer or Warlock spell list, and you can cast this cantrip as if you know it. In addition, a Spellburrow knows one level 1 spell and one level 2 spell from the same spell list its cantrip is from. If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, you can cast these spells as if you had prepared them, and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can choose to use either your Intelligence modifier, or a spellcasting ability modifier you have gained from another source, for these spells.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Throwing Scarab</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>Bred by the daelkyr Valaara, this bizarre symbiont burrows into the palm of its host, secreting razor-sharp chitin blades that can also be used as throwing weapons. When you attune to the scarab, it fuses with one of your hands, visible only as an iridescent, chitinous growth on your palm.</p>
    <p>For every attack you make as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can extrude a shard of razor-sharp chitin from the symbiont into your empty hand, using it for the attack. The shard counts as a magical Simple Melee weapon with which you are proficient. It has the Finesse, Light, and Thrown properties with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 Piercing damage and 1d4 Acid damage. The shard dissolves as soon as it hits or misses its target.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Tongueworm</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This coil of muscle terminates in a sharp barb. When you attune to it, this daelkyr-bred worm attaches to your throat and nestles under your tongue. You can take a Bonus Action to make an Unarmed Strike with the worm, using your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the attack. On a hit, you deal Piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the start of your next turn.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>
    <p>Wandering Eye</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</p>
    <p>This disturbing daelkyr-made symbiont is a leathery tentacle with one end terminating in a single bulbous eye, and the other sporting a barb designed to burrow into flesh. When you attune to the eye, it burrows into one of your shoulders, then rises up from it, studying the world and projecting insights into your mind. The eye may occasionally take an interest in some random element of your current environment; in this case, the DM may draw your attention to this object or person.</p>
    <p>While the eye is uncovered, you gain the following benefits.</p>
    <p>Always Vigilant. The eye remains watchful while you sleep. When you take a Long Rest, the eye remains active, allowing you to use your Passive Wisdom (Perception) score to notice threats even while asleep. If the eye spots danger, it sends you a mental alarm in the form of a nightmare that immediately wakes you up.</p>
    <p>Periscopic Vision. The eye can stretch up to 18 inches and can be used to peer around corners or over cover. When extended and used in this way, the eye has an AC of 20 and 6 Hit Points. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, it uses your statistics. If it is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you cannot benefit from any of the eye’s properties until you finish a Short or Long Rest, after which it regains all lost Hit Points.</p>
    <p>Third Eye. When you make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check involving sight, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.</p>
    <p>Symbiotic Nature. Once you attune to this symbiote, you can&apos;t remove it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Siberys Dragonmarks</h2>

    <p>The thirteen true dragonmarks are manifestations of the Draconic Prophecy. From the inception of Eberron, the idea has been that when a dragonmark first appears, it is quite small, but that over time the mark and the powers it grants can grow—potentially becoming a Lesser or Greater dragonmark. In addition, there has always been the concept of Siberys Dragonmarks: massive dragonmarks that can appear unexpectedly and which grant exceptional power.</p>
    <p>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer presents dragonmarks as feats: A base feat that grants the dragonmark, and a Greater Mark feat that enhances it. Forge of the Artificer also includes an Epic Boon feat called Boon of Siberys, which grants the use of a single spell. While the Boon of Siberys could be used to represent a Siberys Dragonmark, this book presents another approach. The Siberys Dragonmarks that follow are Supernatural Gifts, as described in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Such a mark is something to be granted at the DM’s discretion, when circumstances unlock power within a character that they never knew they possessed. Traditionally, these marks only manifest on people who have a blood tie to a dragonmarked house, although this connection could be distant and unknown to the person who develops the mark. Siberys Dragonmarks can appear on someone who already has the dragonmark in question, but the basic Dragonmark feat is not required. Likewise, a character can choose to take the Boon of Siberys regardless of whether or not they have one of these Siberys Dragonmarks. While a Siberys Dragonmark is something granted by the DM, they are more powerful that the example Supernatural Gifts presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and should not be bestowed lightly or at low levels. A character cannot possess more than one Siberys Dragonmark, and they cannot have a Siberys Dragonmark while also having a Dragonmark feat associated with a different dragonmark.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Ramifications of a Siberys Mark</h3>

    <p>Usually a mark appears when the character engages in a heroic action somehow related to the gifts of the mark—but ultimately, a Siberys Dragonmark is a manifestation of the Prophecy, and its appearance is a signal that the bearer has a destiny to fulfil. Regardless of whether they manifest on a dragonmarked heir or an unknown foundling, the dragonmarked houses value heirs with Siberys Dragonmarks. A character who displays such a mark is treated with more respect by other members of the house, but the barons and seneschals may also place greater demands on them. So, a Siberys Dragonmark is a blessing, but it can also be a burden.</p>

    <p>Kra&apos;uul: Dreambound Items</p>
    <p>The chot’uul monks, who guard the dreams of Dhakaan, craft objects that are drawn to Dal Quor with a dreamer. When you dream, your Kra’uul objects accompany you. The physical object remains with your body in Eberron, but the idea of it travels with you and you can use it while exploring Dal Quor.</p>
    <p>Any Kra’uul made of an otherwise-mundane object is a Common magic item. Kra’uul made of other magic items are the same rarity as the standard version. While the techniques of crafting Kra’uul objects are known only to the chot’uul, the DM can introduce other dreambound objects. A cursed sword might follow its bearer even into dreams, while a powerful Artifact could be even more glorious when seen in Dal Quor.</p>

    <p>House Products</p>
    <p>The dragonmarked houses form the foundation of Khorvaire’s magical economy, and they’re the source of many of the magic items you can buy in the Five Nations. 90% of Potions of Healing are either made by House Jorasco or produced according to their specifications. If you have two +1 Shortswords produced by a Cannith forge, they’ll be essentially identical, while an Aereni Shortsword would be lovingly crafted by a particular artisan.</p>
    <p>In dealing with house products, consider whether the item is military or civilian in nature. During the war, a large portion of House Cannith’s manufactured goods were designed for military use. If you buy a Cloak of Protection from a Cannith dealer in Sharn, is it an elegant model made for a noble to wear to the Tain Gala, or is it a Brelish Bear cloak, originally issued to an elite commando? If an item is essentially a tool of war, then it may have actually been used in the war; if so, which nation was it made for? Is it legitimate surplus? Was it likely sold by a retired soldier, or salvaged from a battlefield?</p>
    <p>Military gear is often more functional than decorative. It may bear the markings of a particular nation, and it’s possible it shows signs of use. On the other hand, civilian products need to lure in customers. Consider a Potion of Healing. The potions Jorasco sold to the Brelish army were known as “coppers” because of the coppery taste of the fluid, and the potency is clearly marked for accurate administration; a Brelish soldier might call a Potion of Superior Healing a “copper-3.” By contrast, a civilian Potion of Healing could be called something like “Vivacity,” with a shiny label and available in a variety of flavors. You might find a barker in a part of town where the people are wealthy enough to buy such a product. “Feeling worn down? Perhaps you’ve had a little fall? Get back on your feet with a shot of Vivacity!”</p>
