<h1 class="compendium-hr">Chapter 1: Discovering Eberron</h1>

<aside class="epigraph">
    <p>You think it’s safe?” The crackling <br/> arcs of energy wreathing the elemental engine cast a pale blue light across the platform. Dela smiled back at him. “It’s perfectly safe, Rev. Haven’t you been on a lightning rail before? What you see there is just a secondary manifestation—”</p>
    <p>Not that.” The warforged soldier’s voice was deep and solemn, like a heavy drum. “This task. The mountains. The island. The journey into dreams. Rusty says it’s impossible.”</p>
    <p>Just because something&apos;s never been done doesn’t mean it’s impossible. It just means it’s a problem I’ve never tried to solve. But safe? No, it’s definitely not safe.” She reached up, resting her hand on his steel shoulder. “That’s why I’m bringing you.”</p>
    <p>Rev gave a single, slow nod. A series of clicks emanated from his right arm, a sound quite familiar to Dela; the warforged was testing his embedded armblade, preparing it for release.</p>
    <p>Eberron is a world shaped by the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations. It’s a setting scarred by the impact of the Last War and defined by the ongoing evolution of magic and artifice. What were the weapons of the Last War? How is magic a part of everyday life in the Five Nations? What events of the distant past could play a role in the present day?</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Ages Past</h2>

    <p>The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the Last War hangs over Khorvaire, setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient. The goblins in Sharn’s slums are descended from the founders of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that humanity stole their homeland. The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters. The Church of the Silver Flame was founded at the end of the third century, but it&apos;s simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that began at the dawn of time—a battle still fought in the shadows by the fiendish Lords of Dust and the dragons of the Chamber.</p>
    <p>Eberron: Rising from the Last War touches briefly on Eberron&apos;s history, but a detailed accounting of the world&apos;s hundred-thousand-year recorded history could easily fill an entire book. This section provides an overview of ancient history, focusing on aspects that are particularly relevant to adventurers—presenting echoes of each era that can be seen in the present day and suggesting story elements that could inspire modern adventures.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Dawn of Creation</h3>

    <p>Period: Dates unknown</p>
    <p>Before history began, legend holds...</p>
    <ul>
            <li>The three Progenitor dragons created the planes.</li>
            <li>In a cosmic quarrel, Khyber destroyed Siberys. Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No one knows what came before the world’s creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation—that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.</p>
    <p>Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.</p>
    <p>Knowing she couldn’t defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.</p>
    <p>While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don’t worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she’s the source of all life, but doesn’t actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.</p>
    <p>Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there is a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Age of Demons</h3>

    <p>Period: More than 100,000 years ago</p>
    <p>During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Eberron was dominated by the overlords, approximately thirty archfiends who shaped reality to their will.</li>
            <li>Champions, later known as the Sovereign Host, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.</li>
            <li>The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the Silver Flame.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber—fiends, aberrations, and other monsters—rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.</p>
    <p>The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions—now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods—or perhaps something else entirely—these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn’t be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It’s commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons—for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It’s up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.</p>
    <p>While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there’s no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.</p>
    <p>Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.</p>
    <p>Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh’s power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Character Ideas</h4>

    <p>Though the overlords are bound and the Sovereigns no longer walk the earth, consider these ways your character might be caught up in their legendary struggle:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>You have a dragonshard embedded in your flesh, the source of some of your class abilities (e.g. Warlock magic or a Barbarian’s Rage). This is a sliver of an overlord’s prison. How did it come to be a part of you? Do the Lords of Dust want to take it from you, or are you destined to become an avatar for an overlord?</li>
            <li>You possess an object your parents swore once belonged to a Sovereign. Currently it has no magical powers, but perhaps there’s some way to activate its potential.</li>
            <li>You were born in the Demon Wastes and spent your life battling fiends. Have you traveled south pursuing a particular fiend? Or do you follow visions granted by the Silver Flame?</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Age of Giants</h3>

    <p>Period: 80,000–40,000 years ago</p>
    <p>During the Age of Giants, scholars describe how...</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Giant nations in Xen’drik unlocked secrets of arcane magic still unmatched in the modern age.</li>
            <li>The giants fought the inhabitants of Dal Quor, ending the conflict by destroying a moon and thereby breaking Dal Quor’s link to Eberron.</li>
            <li>The giants threatened to crush an elvish rebellion with dangerous epic magics, prompting the dragons to step in, utterly destroying Xen’drik and cursing the land.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen’drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons’ increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber’s power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.</p>
    <p>Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen’drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it’s thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul’sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it’s not known whether the Cul’sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.</p>
    <p>These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul’sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves—both those oppressed by the Cul’sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul’sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen’drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler’s Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen’drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du’rashka Tul—“the madness of crowds”—causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed to be the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>The curses laid on Xen’drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen’drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul’sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.</p>
    <p>While Xen’drik’s many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn’t stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Character Ideas</h4>

    <p>Though the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these ideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>As an Elf, you’re haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless Xen’drik. What is the force that’s calling you there?</li>
            <li>As an Artificer, you’re on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the giants. You’ll need to search through their ruins for clues.</li>
            <li>You possess a trinket from Xen’drik—a prospector’s map? an ancient key?—tied to an ancient Sulat vault.</li>
            <li>You own a deed to a small stretch of land outside of Stormreach. Will you try to develop it?</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Age of Monsters</h3>

    <p>Period: 40,000–5,000 years ago</p>
    <p>During the Age of Monsters, history recounts that...</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Elf refugees fleeing the devastation of Xen’drik settled in Aerenal, birthing the Undying Court, the Aereni, and the Tairnadal.</li>
            <li>Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.</li>
            <li>The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Though the daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.</li>
            <li>The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After Xen’drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal—“Aeren’s rest” in Elvish—instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes—the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what’s now Q’barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.</p>
    <p>However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered—along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves (see chapter 4).</p>
    <p>Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids’ shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani ruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the remnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees merely as a useful magical weapon could be an important cultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn’t as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan—discussed in depth in chapter 4—produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.</p>
    <p>This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.</p>
    <p>Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. As described in chapter 4, the Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed—and scheming—in Khyber, adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Character Ideas</h4>

    <p>Whether your character is a goblinoid, orc, or a more recent inhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of Monsters might inform your past and your future:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>As a character from the Shadow Marches, you carry an heirloom amulet you’ve sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it’s part of the wards that bind the daelkyr in Khyber—and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?</li>
            <li>You’re obsessed with the early history of Khorvaire and are always searching for leads on ancient Dhakaani ruins and daelkyr relics. Are you a city Goblin or Tharashk Half-orc searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another species that’s fascinated with the period?</li>
            <li>As a Dhakaani goblinoid (see chapter 4) you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani kech. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?</li>
            <li>You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven’t. Can you master the blade? And what will happen when you encounter the Heirs of Dhakaan?</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Recent History</h2>

    <p>Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire. The gnome sages of the Library of Korranberg call it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of the dragonmarks and the achievements of the dragonmarked houses are more significant in the grand sweep of history than mere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by simply referring to it as the modern age.</p>
    <p>Regardless of where you stand on this argument, a great deal has happened over the last five thousand years. This section begins with an abbreviated timeline, highlights some pivotal moments in Eberron’s history, then delves into some of the more interesting events of recent millennia.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The War of the Mark</h3>

    <p>Period: Approximately 1,500 years ago</p>
    <p>The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors “protecting communities from the aberrant threat.”</p>
    <p>Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them—superstition and fear did the rest. The title “War of the Mark” implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan’s mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.</p>
    <p>Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan’s earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>Aberrant dragonmarks don’t seem to deserve the prejudice leveled against them. They aren’t that powerful, and player characters rarely lose control of their marks. But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve? Or will you try to change public perception and fight the fears?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Kingdom of Galifar</h3>

    <p>Period: 1–894 YK</p>
    <p>Karrn the Conqueror failed to unite Khorvaire by force, but centuries later, his descendant Galifar Wynarn succeeded through might and clever diplomacy. Galifar didn’t just want power—he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.</p>
    <p>Galifar can also be faulted for his precarious system of succession. By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside. This system led to multiple rebellions and attempted secessions over the course of history, the Last War simply the largest and last of them.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>A century of brutal war has divided the people of the Five Nations, but they are still united by a host of common laws and customs—the legacy of Galifar. And there are still many who look back to Galifar as a golden age, who would be willing to go to war again for a chance to return to that supposed paradise.</p>
    <p>Many of the institutions that define the nations—the Arcane Congress, the King’s Citadel, Rekkenmark Academy—were originally dedicated to the common good of Galifar. Members of the longer-lived species, such as elves and dwarves, likely trained at these institutions, regardless of the nations they serve today.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Silver Crusade</h3>

    <p>Period: 830–882 YK</p>
    <p>Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed—the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood—that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.</p>
    <p>In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.</p>
    <p>The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren’t as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.</p>
    <p>While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith—later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame—sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents—including a great many shifters—were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Why Does It Matter?</h4>

    <p>The Silver Crusade is a classic example of a virtuous act with bloody consequences. It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It’s the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes—when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered ‘thropes in Stormreach, Q’barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.</p>
    <p>If you’re playing a follower of the Silver Flame or a Shifter, think about your view of the Silver Crusade. Likewise, if you’re from Aundair or the Eldeen Reaches, consider if your family suffered during the lycanthropic terror.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Untold History</h3>

    <p>Galifar stood for almost a thousand years before collapsing into the Last War. This section has highlighted some particular moments in history that can be used as inspiration for adventure. But both in this book and in the wider canon of Eberron lore, there are vast stretches of time that remain largely undeveloped.</p>
    <p>Within your campaign—whether as a player or Dungeon Master—feel free to develop and explore additional moments of history if they enhance the stories you want to tell. The Untold History table provides a starting point for ideas. As a Dungeon Master, this can be a way to add depth to a story. Have the players arrived at a currently unremarkable inn? Perhaps two hundred years ago, that inn was the headquarters of an alliance of peasants that rose up against the monarchy, only to be brutally suppressed—and they still don’t think much of characters with the Noble background! Or in developing a character, perhaps one of your ancestors was a wizard who made an important arcane breakthrough, only to have it covered up by the dragonmarked houses.</p>
    <p>The crucial point is that established history is a place to start, nothing more. Use the ideas presented here when they can help you. But always feel empowered to expand the world and develop the history of your Eberron, even if it may not match official sourcebooks that come out in the future.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Cyre: Before the Mourning</h2>

    <p>The Jewel in Galifar’s Crown. Wondrous Cyre. Cyre was the heart of the united kingdom of Galifar. But what was the nation actually like? Since Cyre has fallen, lore often focuses on the current plight of the refugees and not on the nation they lost. As a Cyran character, what are the memories you treasure? What was your childhood like? If you hope to rebuild your nation, what is it that you aspire to recreate?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">What Our Dreams Imagine</h3>

    <p>Galifar Wynarn was a military genius, but it was his eldest daughter Cyre, twin to Aundair, who imagined the warring nations working together as a single family: Karrnathi might, Daskari faith, and the wisdom of Thaliost working together for the greater good. In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows—the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future. Cyre’s motto captures the heart of this nation and its people: “What our dreams imagine, our hands create.”</p>
    <p>The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King’s Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together—the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the Everbright Lantern, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece—a city of wonders—this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.</p>
    <p>This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever. The people of Cyre can trace their roots to all of these nations, believing they share these strengths; and beyond that, Cyrans strive to be creative, innovative, and artistic.</p>
    <p>Cyre’s artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith’s greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It’s said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There’s no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. “What our dreams imagine, our hands create,” but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.</p>
    <p>This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar’s traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch’s children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Outer Cyre</h4>

    <p>Galifar’s goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol—which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland—the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre’s dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.</p>
    <p>Southern Cyre covered what is now Darguun. Largely unsettled when Galifar was founded, it persisted as a backwater in the shadow of the kingdom. Its people ultimately prospered and took pride in their identity as Cyrans, mimicking the customs of the central kingdom. However, they had little of the wealth invested in the north or the wonders that came with it. There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal’dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.</p>
    <p>Eastern Cyre—now Valenar—was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar’s greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it’s because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called “thrones”), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Cyre and the Last War</h3>

    <p>Under the reign of King Jarot, Cyre continued to shine. Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre—expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.</p>
    <p>Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre’s finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a Paladin, Karrnath is a Fighter, Aundair is a Wizard, and Breland is a Rogue. In this party, Cyre is the Bard—elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.</p>
    <p>Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar’s treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be—and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King’s Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre’s new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Cyran Style</h3>

    <p>For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the Epic of Valiant and Vigilant, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.</p>
    <p>Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre—to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there&apos;s no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there’s always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera—a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it’s a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they’re constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation—that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the “Cyran appreciation.&quot;</p>
    <p>In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Fashion</h4>

    <p>Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation—this base layer may be colorful, but it’s first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it’s more functional than decorative.</p>
    <p>After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a Glamerweave lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren’t intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with Glamerweave). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear—clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cuisine</h4>

    <p>Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn’s culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation—adopting new favorites from the place they’ve found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Magic</h4>

    <p>Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it’s also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, Bard, or Wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a Wizard who’s studied at the Wynarn Institute, Somatic components are almost a dance, while Verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Cyran Religion</h3>

    <p>The Silver Flame had some devoted followers and temples in central Cyre, though the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith. However, religion is driven by faith and tradition, and Cyrans have always been encouraged to question and search for new paths. Outer Cyre is a different story. The nobles of Eastern Cyre were and are devout Vassals, convinced they have a divine right to leadership. The people of Southern Cyre are less arrogant, but most hold to a quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns.</p>
    <p>The war drove some Cyrans to embrace their faith more tightly, but for others it was another source of doubt. Likewise, the Mourning threw many devout Cyrans into a crisis of faith, while for others, it actually strengthened it. A devout follower of the Silver Flame doesn’t question the cause of the Mourning, they simply seek to protect the innocent from harm. Vassals of the Sovereign Host trust that there is a purpose to their suffering. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Mourning, some Cyrans have turned to the Blood of Vol or cults of the Dragon Below, cursing the gods they once worshiped or following a darker vision. There are also a number of new strains of the old faiths, Cyran twists on the Flame and the Host that seek to adapt traditions to make sense of the war and the world.</p>
    <p>In playing a Cyran, whether a divine caster or other religious character, consider the impact the Mourning had on your faith. Are you conflicted and struggling to hold to your beliefs? Or was the Mourning a source of inspiration—you know you have a divine purpose, that your people need you? If you’re tied to an existing faith, do you follow the standard traditions or have you found an unusual path?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Three Cyres</h3>

    <p>When most people say “Cyre,” they’re thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you’re from.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Central Cyre</h4>

    <p>If you’re from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the “true” Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Eastern Cyre</h4>

    <p>As an Eastern Cyran, you’re tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don’t accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being “the best of Galifar” or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You’re not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn’t your Cyre that was destroyed—now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you’re unlikely to choose the Noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the true royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Southern Cyre</h4>

    <p>Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service—it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you. Many of your friends and family chose to idolize Queen Dannel and central Cyre, believing that she had a vision and would rebuild Galifar, restoring an age of wonders. Did you feel that way? Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Wonders of Cyre</h3>

    <p>Cyre was a land of wonders, but it’s now lost to the Mournland, leaving Cyrans with only memories. Some of its most renowned marvels stood in Metrol, including...</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Vermishards</h4>

    <p>Seven spires rise up from Metrol, a natural (or supernatural) wonder. These plateaus held the ancestral homes of the noble lines of old Metrol with the Royal Vermishard the seat of the Cyran crown. However, over centuries, other powers—such as House Cannith and House Phiarlan—made their way to the Vermishards as well. Cannith and Phiarlan worked together with Cyran magewrights to embed illusory lighting into the Vermishards, their glittering spires becoming a remarkable part of the Metrol skyline.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Wynarn Institute of Art</h4>

    <p>The Wynarn Institute was both one of the foremost academies of magic in Khorvaire and one of its most amazing museums, exploring the artistic potential of the arcane. Treasures of the pre-Galifar kingdoms were displayed here along with modern works of art. In addition to purely artistic exhibits, the Hall of Kings allowed visitors to converse with illusory replicas of the past rulers of Galifar. Though some cultures preserve their rulers so they can advise successors—such as the Aereni elves in chapter 3 and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal in chapter 4—the illusions of the Hall of Kings were merely a tourist attraction.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Vault</h4>

    <p>The Royal Treasury of Galifar was commonly known as the Vault. While there were reserves hidden around the kingdom, the Vault included both the mint, Cyre’s primary reserves of currencies and precious metals, and important cultural artifacts deemed too valuable to be displayed. Salvagers have dreamed of finding this “Golden Palace,” but there are some stories saying that the Vault no longer remains where it was built, but is actually missing. The Mourning had strange effects on Metrol, and it’s possible the Vault was simply physically displaced, or it could have fallen into another plane.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host</h4>

    <p>Following the spread of the Church of the Silver Flame in Thrane, the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host became the primary seat of Vassal devotion in Galifar. Many of the rulers of Galifar would build an addition to the Cathedral as a way of showing their piety. By the reign of King Jarot, it was a wonder indeed. Nine colossal statues encircled the temple, illusory displays within depicted scenes from the faith, and it held a vast collection of relics and artifacts. The fate of the Cathedral and its treasures remains unknown.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Countless Wonders</h4>

    <p>These wonders just scratch the surface of what was possible. Aundair had floating towers; Cyre expanded on this with floating gardens, flower petals falling on the wind to the cities below. Even small towns had crystal theaters where audiences could scry on the great performances in the Demesne of Shape. There was always music in the air and lights in the sky. With this in mind, feel free to create wonders of your own imagination. Cyre was the seat of House Cannith and House Phiarlan, second only to Aundair in arcane sophistication. What your dreams imagine, their hands could create. And even if they didn’t create the things you dream of, people might believe that they did, as the legends of Cyre only continue to grow now that the kingdom is lost.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Playing a Cyran Survivor</h3>

    <p>As a Cyran, you come from a culture that strove to find the best in all things, that encouraged creativity and innovation. But your people also lived through a century of betrayal and war, fighting enemies on all sides. How has this affected you? Are you an idealist who still believes in the promise of Galifar—someone who believes that the Five Nations can and should unite, someone who tries to bring people together? Or do you curse the traitors who betrayed Mishann and doomed Galifar? Are you scarred by the memory of the Mourning and determined to reclaim your homeland—or rebuild it somewhere else—or are you always looking forward to what happens next? Do you have any living relatives, and if so, where are they now and what is their situation? Will you send money to your family in High Walls or New Cyre, or are you alone in the world? Where was your home and what did you leave behind? Is there anything you wish you could recover from the Mournland, whether something with practical value or simply sentimental? What do you still possess that reminds you of Cyre?</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">The Last War</h2>

    <p>The Last War shaped the modern age. Eberron: Rising from the Last War explores the bitter grievances lingering after a century of strife and discusses options for running campaigns set during the war itself. The third-edition sourcebook Forge of War presents a detailed timeline for the war. This section expands on the tools of modern warfare and the ways in which this conflict might shape a character.</p>
    <p>At a glance, Khorvaire can appear medieval. Soldiers carry spears and swords and Thrane is renowned for its archers. But magic is a central part of life in the Five Nations, used for communication, transportation, entertainment... and war. What weapons were employed on the battlefields of the Last War? What forces can be found patrolling the borders? And what were some of the major innovations of the Last War?</p>
    <p>To clarify what lies ahead: This section does not present a system for running mass combats. Rather, it explores the tools and tactics used in the Last War so that adventures can incorporate those elements into the story. This allows for an adventure in which the heroes have to make their way through a field of Blast Disks, or must seize a Siege Staff to halt bombardment. But this section doesn’t include a system detailing artillery spotting and the accuracy of sustained bombardment. It explores the tools of the Last War with the intent that they could appear in traditional adventures.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Arcane Artillery</h3>

    <p>Wands, Staffs, and Rods are well-established weapons in the world of Eberron. Similarly, arcane artillery doesn’t employ any sort of physical projectile, relying solely on magical energy—but rather than a small weapon one person can easily carry, arcane artillery refers to a variety of larger arcane foci that can increase the range and area of magical attacks. Likewise, the war employed magical explosives such as Blast Disks that could wreak devastation by triggering a previously stored spell.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, the everyday magic of the Five Nations encompasses spell effects of up to 3rd level; while 4th- and 5th-level effects exist, they are rare and remarkable. This means that effects like Wall of Force could be seen on the battlefield, but were exceptional and rarely deployed, while blasts of fire and lightning were more common.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Operating Arcane Artillery</h4>

    <p>While a specially trained spellcaster must operate arcane artillery, more than one person can assist with its operation, allowing a team to prime, aim, and fire in a single round.</p>
    <p>All attack rolls and saving throws are based on the spellcasting ability of the operator firing the weapon. When arcane artillery is used to target someone at long range, any attack roll has Disadvantage and any saving throw against the spell effect has Advantage.</p>
    <p>Using these weapons requires specialized training, similar to that of an Artificer or magewright; someone trained to operate arcane artillery is generally called a bombardier. A typical bombardier may use the Magewright stat block, but they also know one or more spells that they’re only able to cast using a focus—such as a Siege Staff or Long Rod. So an Aundairian specialist might be able to produce Cloudkill through a focus, but not cast the spell on its own. Bombardiers don’t use spell slots when casting these spells; instead, they prime the weapon using a dragonshard solution known as the Breath of Siberys.</p>
    <p>However, player characters are more versatile than magewrights or bombardiers. The DM could allow your spellcasting character to use artillery without penalty if it fits the needs of the story or if you have a background that justifies it—for example, if you’re a Wizard with the Soldier background. Otherwise, the DM could say that you can operate it at a penalty: you can’t cast spells or make attacks at long range; your attack rolls have Disadvantage; and saving throws against your attacks have Advantage. As a player character, you can prime the weapon using the Breath of Siberys, or you can expend a spell slot as usual when priming the artillery.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Siege Staff</h4>

    <p>Huge Arcane Artillery (Staff), Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster</p>
    <p>Armor Class: 15&#9;&#9;&#9;Hit Points: 120</p>
    <p>Siege Staffs, the primary form of arcane artillery, are made of wood—typically around fifteen feet long—engraved with mystic sigils and inlaid with dragonshards.</p>
    <p>Activating a Siege Staff takes 3 Magic actions: one to prime the staff; one to aim it; and one to release the spell.</p>
    <p>There are several basic models of Siege Staff, each of which serves a different purpose. When activated, it produces one of the following effects, determined by its model:</p>
    <p>Blast Staff. This model was typically used to bombard massed troops or villages, unleashing a wide burst of energy. It has a normal range of 300 feet and a long range of 1,200 feet. It targets all creatures within a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Targets must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
    <p>Force Staff. This model releases focused blasts of pure energy. Developed late in the war, these were primarily used to target fortifications, warforged titans, and airships. It has a normal range of 600 feet and a long range of 2,400 feet. A target takes 44 (8d10) Force damage.</p>
    <p>Focus Staff. This model amplifies the spells cast by an attuned spellcaster. Any spell that requires an attack roll or saving throw can be cast through this model of Siege Staff. The range is magnified by a factor of 5, with a long range of up to 10 times the spell’s standard range—so a Fire Bolt cast through a Focus Staff has a normal range of 600 feet and a long range of 1,200 feet. The spell’s area of effect is doubled. If the spell normally affects a single target, it instead affects a 20-foot-radius Sphere; if the spell normally requires an attack roll, targets must instead make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no other effect.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Long Rod</h4>

    <p>Large Arcane Artillery (Rod), Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster</p>
    <p>Armor Class: 15&#9;&#9;&#9;Hit Points: 40</p>
    <p>A Long Rod is a more portable version of a Siege Staff, measuring around 8 feet long. Including the stand required to brace it, it weighs close to 350 pounds.</p>
    <p>It takes 5 Magic actions to set up a Long Rod, and the same to tear down for transport. Once set up, it takes 1 Magic action to prime the rod, 1 Magic action to aim it, and 1 Magic action to fire it.</p>
    <p>Any spell that requires an attack roll or saving throw can be cast through a Long Rod. The range is magnified by a factor of 3, with a long range of up to 6 times the spell’s standard range. The spell’s area of effect is increased to 150%. If the spell normally affects a single target, it instead affects a 10-foot-radius Sphere; if the spell normally requires an attack roll, targets must instead make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no other effect.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Enhanced Artillery</h4>

    <p>While arcane artillery is a powerful force, there’s still a place for mundane siege engines that use physical projectiles, described in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The Ballista, Mangonel, and Trebuchet are all common forms of artillery, seen on both the battlefield and on warships. However, just as a Thrane archer may have used an enchanted bow, the siege engines of the Last War are enhanced with magical power.</p>
    <p>Animated Engines. A siege engine can be partially animated, speeding its use. Generally, an animated engine loads itself while the crew aims it, requiring only 2 Magic actions to fire an animated Ballista or 3 Magic actions to use an animated Mangonel. House Cannith also manufactured fully animated siege engines, capable of self-aiming. Such an engine required the same number of Magic actions to aim and fire as a crewed engine, it simply had no need of a crew. However, these engines could only follow simple instructions and had little ability to adapt, requiring clear, absolute orders to be effective: “Continue to attack the north tower until it is destroyed.”</p>
    <p>Cannons. A Cannon is a weapon that can inflict significant Bludgeoning damage at great distances. As noted in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, a Cannon doesn’t have to use gunpowder, and those used in the Last War did not. The most common form of Cannon is the Elemental Cannon produced by the gnomes of Zilargo, which uses the essence of a bound earth elemental to project stone cannonballs with tremendous force; Zilargo began supplying Breland with these weapons toward the end of the Last War. While Cannith and the Five Nations experimented with other Cannon models, the Siege Staff typically filled this role on the battlefield.</p>
    <p>Enchanted Ammunition. Ballista bolts and Mangonel missiles are often enchanted with spell effects that trigger when the bolt strikes its target. This effect is in addition to the standard damage inflicted by the siege engine.</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Explosive Ammunition affects a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on the impact of the bolt. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Typically, Explosive Ammunition deals Fire damage, igniting flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. However, Karrnathi Deathbolts deal Necrotic damage and only harm living creatures, while Thrane Tira’s Tears deal Radiant damage.</li>
            <li>Summoning Ammunition conjures creatures around the point of impact. Aundairian Firestones produce a temporary Flaming Sphere that randomly rolls around the area of impact. Zil binders developed a more powerful form of this ammunition which casts Conjure Elemental on detonation, but it is extremely costly and rare.</li>
            <li>Panic Stones force all creatures within a 90-foot-radius Sphere centered on the impact of the stone to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw drops whatever it is holding and has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. On each of its turns, a Frightened target must take the Dash action and move away from the Panic Stone by the safest and shortest route available. If an affected creature moves to a space at least 90 feet away from the Panic Stone where it can’t see the stone, this effect ends.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Arcane Explosives</h3>

    <p>The Blast Disk is the most common form of magical explosive used in the Five Nations. While Blast Disks serve a similar role to bombs or landmines, they can produce a wide range of magical effects; a blast disk could trigger a burst of Confusion and start a riot, or summon a rampaging elemental into a crowded town square.</p>
    <p>All nations employed Blast Disks during the Last War; when exploring abandoned battlefields, untriggered Blast Disks are an ongoing threat. While all nations used simple Force or Fire explosions, there were a few variations tied to specific nations:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Aundair made extensive use of high-powered Blast Disks; they were infamous for dragonhawk squads equipped with Cloudkill disks.</li>
            <li>Breland utilized the base model of Explosive Disks.</li>
            <li>Cyre experimented with psychoactive effects—Confusion, Fear, and explosions that dealt Psychic damage.</li>
            <li>During the ascendancy of the Blood of Vol, Karrnath created disks that first dealt Necrotic damage, then inflicted effects such as Danse Macabre—killing victims with the initial explosion then animating the corpses to prey on survivors.</li>
            <li>Thrane developed Blast Disks that dealt Radiant damage—a useful tool against Karrnathi undead. Toward the end of the war, Thrane was working on Sunbeam disks that would blast enemies for a full minute after activation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the basic Blast Disk is a Common magic item, under the Code of Galifar, they’re illegal for civilians to own or carry. House Cannith manufactures Blast Disks, but won’t sell them to civilians (at least, not openly). So if you’re looking for a Blast Disk, you’ll need to have criminal connections or build your own.</p>
    <p>The following statistics describe the standard rules for Blast Disks, but more powerful versions can be created to serve the needs of a particular story. A powerful Explosive Disk could have a radius of hundreds of feet instead of just twenty, while a Cloudkill disk could unleash a force that expands as it moves and lingers for hours or days.</p>
    <p>Many different forms of artillery and explosives were developed during the war, often abandoned once they proved too expensive or difficult to produce. The above are only a few examples of the magic-empowered tools used during the war, and as always, you are encouraged to introduce others if they enhance your story.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Blast Disk</h4>

    <p>Wondrous Item, Common, Uncommon, or Rare</p>
    <p>A Blast Disk holds destructive arcane power. A typical Blast Disk is about nine inches in diameter and one inch thick, made from layers of different metal; dragonshards are embedded in the surface of the disk and arcane symbols are engraved in its surface. Anyone studying the surface of the disk can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check corresponding to the save DC of the disk. On a success, they identify the spell effect contained within the disk.</p>
    <p>There are three elements to a Blast Disk: the trigger, the payload, and the charge. Each effect is selected at the time it is created.</p>
    <p>Trigger. A spellcaster touching a Blast Disk can take a Magic action to activate it. However, generally you don’t want to be holding a Blast Disk when it goes off. A Blast Disk can be created with one of the following triggers, or with a more complex trigger of the creator’s choosing (e.g. to detonate when a certain word is spoken, when a specific object comes within range, etc.):</p>
    <p>Time. When the disk is activated, the user can set a time delay of up to 10 minutes before it releases its effect.</p>
    <p>Proximity. 30 seconds after the disk is activated, it can trigger when someone comes within a certain distance of the disk or when someone first makes contact with the disk, then breaks that contact.</p>
    <p>Impact. The activated disk can be set to detonate on impact, then used by throwing or dropping it.</p>
    <p>Payload. When the Blast Disk is triggered, it produces one of the following magical effects, chosen when it was manufactured:</p>
    <p>Explosive. This creates an explosion in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the disk. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. An explosive Blast Disk deals triple damage to objects or structures. The damage type is set when the disk is created.</p>
    <p>Spell Effect. The disk produces a spell effect when triggered. The effect must target either a single creature—whoever triggers the disk—or an area of effect centered on the disk. The level of the spell in the disk determines the saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the item’s rarity, as shown on the Blast Disk Power table.</p>
    <p>Charge. A typical Blast Disk holds a single charge, the dragonshards shattering when the effect is triggered. However, more advanced Blast Disks recharge at dawn; this increases the rarity of the disk by one category.</p>
    <p>Disarming a Disk. When used on the battlefield, Blast Disks are typically buried or hidden. Finding the disk requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check, with a DC equal to the ability check that was used when it was hidden, such as Wisdom (Nature) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). To disarm a Blast Disk, a character with proficiency in Arcana must succeed on a Dexterity check using Thieves’ Tools, with a DC equal to the save DC of the disk. If the check is failed by 5 or more, the disk detonates as if it were triggered. Successfully disarming a Blast Disk expends one charge, meaning most Blast Disks will be rendered inert after disarming.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Air Forces</h3>

    <p>While the elemental airship is a recent innovation, aerial combat has long been a part of warfare. Flying scouts are a basic component of reconnaissance. Aerial commandos can bypass fortifications and strike at the heart of the enemy. Air cavalry equipped with ranged weapons or spellcasters can make devastating strikes on ground troops.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Flying Mounts</h4>

    <p>These beasts are the most common form of aerial cavalry. Most are bred and trained by House Vadalis, though a few nations have their own personal traditions:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Hippogriffs are the most common Vadalis flying mount. All nations used these to some degree.</li>
            <li>Griffons are another Vadalis staple. Tougher than hippogriffs, griffons were often used to carry a strike force into the middle of a conflict, fighting alongside their passengers.</li>
            <li>Pegasi are exceptional mounts, but are rare and can’t be forced into service. The House Vadalis enclave in Sharn is one of the few places where they’re trained, and Breland has an elite force of pegasi riders.</li>
            <li>Many Mror clans have established relationships with manticores, and Kundarak is known for its manticore cavalry.</li>
            <li>Aundair is renowned for its dragonhawks, creatures similar to giant eagles, and long ago adopted them as the nation’s national symbol.</li>
            <li>Since long before Galifar, the nobles of Thrane have maintained a small stable of wyverns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these are especially notable examples, many other animals—including glidewings, giant hawks, giant eagles, and giant owls—are used as mounts and could be encountered during the Last War. This diversity is reflected in Sharn’s annual Race of Eight Winds.</p>
    <p>While one rider needs to guide the beast, larger mounts can carry multiple riders. A hippogriff can bear a single archer or wandslinger, while a griffon or wyvern can carry several. Thrane was the first nation to employ Bags of Holding to devastating effect, allowing a rider to carry a supply of Blast Disks or, more simply, to drop any number of large, heavy objects.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Flying Creatures</h4>

    <p>Gargoyles make excellent scouts and couriers, while harpies can have a devastating disruptive effect on troops. House Tharashk only began selling the services of these creatures in 988 YK, so they were never fully integrated into the war effort. However, a number of nations are still exploring ways to effectively exploit the capabilities of these creatures.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Magic Items</h4>

    <p>In addition to its beloved dragonhawks, Aundair also deployed elite units equipped with Brooms of Flying. Other nations managed to duplicate these on a smaller scale, using them for scouts and spies, but Aundair was the only nation that fielded actual squads of broom riders in battle.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Elemental Airships</h4>

    <p>The first elemental airships went into service in 990 YK, just four years before the Mourning. Airships require a Lyrandar pilot, and initially Lyrandar was loath to devote its vessels to purely military service. It was only in 994 YK that they produced a small number of “stormships.” Today, Lyrandar is likely working with someone to develop aerial warships, but it’s up to the DM to decide which nation(s) they’re working with, if any.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Wandslingers</h3>

    <p>Magic evolves. When Galifar I forged his kingdom, his wizards hadn’t mastered Fire Bolt or Ray of Frost. The development of the cantrip—casual spells that can be used at will—took centuries, as the Arcane Congress studied Aereni techniques and the powers of sorcery. The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the War Staff and Battle Rod. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it’s no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people “arcane dragoons.” If you fight your battles with Fire Bolt or Sacred Flame, you’re known as a “wandslinger.”</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">What is a Wandslinger?</h4>

    <p>At its simplest level, a wandslinger is any individual capable of casting a damage-dealing cantrip. Beyond that, it’s about how you present yourself to the world. If you know the Fire Bolt cantrip—whether as a Wizard, a Sorcerer, or because you took the Magic Initiate feat—you could be a wandslinger. Do you carry an Arcane Focus? If so, do you display it prominently? Do you carry your Wand of Fernian Ash with pride, twirling it and doing flame tricks? If so, you’re a wandslinger. By contrast, if you’re a scholarly wizard who despises conflict and prefers not to use an Arcane Focus, you’re not a wandslinger, even though you are just as capable at magical combat. As much as anything, it’s about attitude.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">NPC Wandslingers</h4>

    <p>The typical NPC wandslinger can be based on any stat block, adding the ability to cast at least two cantrips. Most arcane dragoons could also cast at least one 1st-level spell. An exceptional wandslinger may know additional cantrips or spells as fits the needs of the story. The “Battle Magic: Range and Radius” sidebar presents two new wandslinger spells.</p>
    <p>Since NPCs don’t follow the same rules as player characters and player characters are exceptional, the DM may decide that an NPC wandslinger needs an Arcane Focus in order to cast a spell. Player characters are versatile; it’s useful for you to have a Wand, but you can work around its absence. The typical arcane dragoon needs a Wand, Rod, or Staff in order to cast a spell or cantrip. Here are a few examples of NPC wandslingers:</p>
    <p>Aundairian Dragoon. Cantrips known: Force Blast, Shocking Grasp. Spells known: Concussive Burst (1/Day).</p>
    <p>Brelish Firebrand. Cantrips known: Fire Bolt, Light. Spells known: Burning Hands (1/Day).</p>
    <p>Cyran Phantasm. Cantrips known: Minor Illusion, Starry Wisp. Spells known: Shield (1/Day).</p>
    <p>Karrnathi Ghoul. Cantrips known: Chill Touch, Poison Spray. Spells known: Cause Fear (1/Day).</p>
    <p>Thrane Beacon. Cantrips known: Sacred Flame, Word of Radiance. Spells known: Guiding Bolt (1/Day).</p>
    <p>Battle Magic: Range and Radius</p>
    <p>As Aundair expanded the use of arcane dragoons, it saw the need for spells that could match the range of the Thrane archers, or bring down large numbers of peasant levies. Force Blast is a simple spell that lacks the offensive punch of a Firebolt, but has greater range than a Longbow and a rarely resisted damage type. Concussive Burst isn’t as deadly as Burning Hands or Thunderwave, but it covers the same area as a Fireball while being accessible to a wandslinger. These spells, which are detailed in chapter 6, may not appeal to player characters, but you could find them in the hands of enemy wandslingers.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Other Specialties</h4>

    <p>While wandslingers are becoming more commonplace, at the moment this is still an elite specialty. By adding wandslinger capabilities to a standard stat block, such as a Guard, you are reflecting specialized training, much like a player character acquiring a feat. If you want to add more national flavor to current or former soldiers, you can add different feats to a stat block. Thrane is known for its archers; if you want to represent an elite Thrane archer, you could use the Scout stat block but add the benefits of the Sharpshooter feat. Karrnath fielded exceptional heavy infantry, and a Karrnathi Knight could gain the benefits of the Heavy Armor Master feat.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Wands and Staffs</h4>

    <p>The wandslinger is trained to use an Arcane Focus: the power isn’t in the Wand, it’s simply a tool for channeling a spell. But what of magic Wands, Staffs, and Rods? Under the wide-magic principles of Eberron, Common and Uncommon items are part of the magical industry; Rare items are exotic and expensive; and Very Rare and Legendary items are largely beyond the capabilities of Cannith and the Arcane Congress. As such, weapons such as a Wand of Fireballs or Wand of Lightning Bolts could be found on the battlefield, especially when dealing with Aundair, but they were rare, only assigned to elite units and critical operations.</p>
    <p>However, House Cannith and Aundair’s Arcane Congress are always working to produce more efficient weapons, and the Wand of Magic Missiles is one such recent development. Prior versions of the wand were more expensive, could only be used by trained spellcasters, or didn’t regain charges. The Wand of Magic Missiles breaks this barrier: it’s an Uncommon magic item that doesn’t require Attunement and can be used by any creature. A wealthy wandslinger could carry a brace of wands, unleashing a barrage of bolts from a new wand each round. Wands of Magic Missiles may be found in the hands of criminal enforcers, royal guards, or any number of other professionals, and can potentially be purchased across the Five Nations. However, they were perfected by the Arcane Congress just twelve years ago, and House Cannith has yet to replicate that technique. As a result, these wands are primarily found in Aundair or used by Aundairians; a wand being sold in Sharn may be surplus or salvage recovered from Aundairian soldiers during the war.</p>
    <p>Sooner or later House Cannith will duplicate this item and they’ll become available at any Cannith enclave. But for now, these wands can still be difficult to find outside Aundair.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Warforged Titans</h3>

    <p>Throughout the Last War, Cyre poured gold into House Cannith’s coffers, urging them to develop ever-deadlier weapons. In 959 YK, Cannith presented Queen Dannel with the first warforged titans. For a time, this gave Cyre an edge—but as always, Cannith began selling these creations to other nations, as well as selling Blast Disks and Siege Staffs to those who needed to fight titans.</p>
    <p>During the Last War, the warforged titan served a number of critical roles. The mere presence of an imposing titan provided a defensive bulwark for infantry, as enemy infantry could rarely afford to engage a titan without artillery or magical support. Titans are tireless, surprisingly swift, and capable of crossing almost any terrain. Thanks to the Siege Monster ability, they are also devastatingly effective against fortifications and siege engines.</p>
    <p>The statistics of a basic Warforged Titan, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, grant it additional versatility from its Platforms trait. A titan has two platforms in its chassis, each designed to hold one Medium or smaller creature. Typically, these platforms hold archers, providing the warforged with some minimal ranged support to complement its powerful melee attacks. However, specialized crew can dramatically increase the capabilities of a titan: an Evoker Wizard can provide strong ranged attacks, while an Abjurer Wizard can stand ready to counter or dispel enemy magic, and an onboard artificer can keep the titan operational. Sending your titan against Karrnathi undead? An exorcist can be a boon for dealing with undead. Alternatively, a titan could simply serve as a battering ram, carrying two spies or commandos ready to leap off and blend into an enemy community as soon as the titan breaches a defensive wall.</p>
    <p>While the Warforged Titan stat block represents the basic design, over the course of nearly forty years in service, there were many variations on that design. Consider using one of these options as a way to add flavor to a titan.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Armbow</h4>

    <p>One of the titan’s weapons can be replaced with an integrated ballista. This weapon is self-loading and conjures ammunition. If the titan has an Armbow, replace either the Axehand or Hammerfist with the following attack:</p>
    <p>Armbow. Ranged Attack Roll: +6, range 120/480 ft. Hit: 16 (3d10) Piercing damage.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Long Rod</h4>

    <p>Late in the war, Cannith developed titans that had only one platform, with a Long Rod (as described in the “Arcane Artillery” section) integrated in place of the other platform.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Shielding</h4>

    <p>Titans serving in particular regions were often shielded against a relevant type of elemental damage. For example, Force and Fire were the damage types most typically tied to Blast Disks or Siege Staffs, so Cannith often designed titans with Resistance to one of these damage types.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Troop Transport</h4>

    <p>The titan has a hollow space within its chassis and can carry up to 6 Medium creatures or extra cargo. Due to the loss of body mass, a model made for transport only has an Armor Class of 18 and 100 Hit Points, but increases its Speed to 45 feet.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Titan Consciousness</h4>

    <p>While called “warforged,” the titans are quite different from the truly living constructs that came after them. Titans have limited sentience. They imprint on their commanders, and to a lesser degree, on the uniforms of their allies. They can follow orders and general instructions such as “protect allies” or “engage enemies.” But as a rule, titans don’t feel emotion, reflected by the fact that they have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. Today, most remaining titans are simply waiting in storage, content to remain motionless until it’s time to serve again.</p>
    <p>Yet there are stories of titans who’ve developed full consciousness. If the tales are true, this could be the result of rogue artificers (possibly cultists of the Traveler hidden within House Cannith), or it could be a random spark of evolution—suggesting that the potential for sentience lies within all titans.</p>
    <p>A sentient titan loses its Immunity to Psychic damage and the Frightened and Charmed conditions, but it has Advantage on saving throws against effects that cause these conditions. Its Intelligence increases to 10 (or higher) and it is capable of making its own decisions.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">War Stories</h3>

    <p>Khorvaire has suffered through a century of war, the conflict ending with the Treaty of Thronehold just two years ago. As an adventurer, you are someone with remarkable talents and skills. Did you serve in the war? If so, what nation did you fight for and in what capacity? If not, why not? Do you feel no loyalty to your homeland? Do you oppose the idea of war? Or did you just have something better to do with your time?</p>
    <p>The third edition sourcebook Forge of War details the events of the war, while Eberron: Rising from the Last War explores ways that it can shape an adventure. This section explores how the war can shape characters—things to consider while creating your character and ideas that could inspire you moving forward.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">How Did You Serve?</h4>

    <p>If you’re human, you grew up surrounded by war. If you’re a member of a longer-lived species, you may remember a time before the war—but if so, you were alive for many decades of conflict. How did it affect you? How is this reflected by your character background, or your ideals or flaws?</p>
    <p>The Last War Background table provides ideas for characters shaped by the Last War. What impact did the war have on your life? You don’t have to have the Soldier background to have served in the Last War; someone with the Guide background could have been a scout, while a Sage or Artisan might have maintained arcane artillery. Regardless of how you served, which nation are you from? Do you feel loyalty to your nation, and if so, do you despise your former enemies? Or do you support peace and hope for a new era of unity in Khorvaire?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Ongoing Conflict</h4>

    <p>The war is over, but nobody won. How do you feel about it? As an adventurer, perhaps you believe that it doesn’t really concern you. You may be glad the war is over and look forward to a new era of peace and international cooperation. On the other hand, if you’re a patriot, you may have strong feelings about the war and current peace. Consider how your character feels about the following topics.</p>
    <p>Nationality. If you’re from one of the Five Nations, how do you feel about the others? Are you proud of your nation’s actions during the war, ashamed, or ambivalent? Do you blame the citizens of rival nations for the losses you’ve suffered? What about the new nations that have emerged during the war—Valenar, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, the Mror Holds, and Droaam? Do you support these nations, or do you consider them to be traitors and rebels?</p>
    <p>Lost Lands. Thrane still holds the Aundairian city of Thaliost, and this is far from the only town that’s changed hands. Darguun and Valenar seized land from Cyre, and the Eldeen Reaches split from Aundair. Do you have attachments to one of the new nations? If you’re from one of these regions, are you a fervent supporter of your young nation, or are you ambivalent to the struggles it may face? If you’re tied to one of the lands that was lost, do you want revenge or to restore your homeland?</p>
    <p>Rivals or Revenge. Consider what you’ve lost and what you’ve been through. Did you make any enemies during the war? Have you sworn to one day get vengeance on the Karrnathi general who slaughtered your unit and raised your dearest friends as undead? Or perhaps the cruel commandant who had you tortured in a prison camp? The incompetent Cannith magewright who supplied your troops with faulty weapons? Or do you have a more friendly rival—a fellow soldier who always outshone you on the battlefield that you’re determined to outdo in the future?</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Magic in the World</h2>

    <p>There are challenges facing every society, problems that need to be solved. Communication. Transportation. Even entertainment. In Khorvaire, magic is the tool people use to solve these problems. But what does that look like? Everyone knows about the lightning rail and the elemental airship. But what about when you walk into a tavern or down the main street of a small town? The Magical Ambience table provides a few examples of everyday magic seen at work.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Wide Magic</h3>

    <p>The Five Nations are built on a foundation of magical tools and services. Arcane magic is understood to be a form of science: anyone with the aptitude for it can train at a house trade school to become a magewright or learn how to be a wandslinger. There’s nothing strange about seeing an airship in the sky or sending a message to a distant friend using a Speaking Stone.</p>
    <p>However, a common maxim about Khorvaire is that it possesses “wide magic, not high magic.” While the Speaking Stone allows you to send messages between two stone stations, Sending is a rarer service that fewer people can afford. Lesser Restoration is available at any good Jorasco healing house, but Raise Dead isn’t so trivial.</p>
    <p>As a broad rule, the people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or spells of 1st and 2nd level. They’re familiar with 3rd-level spells—Fireballs on the battlefield, aristocrats using Sivis Sending services—but these things are expensive. Effects of 4th or 5th level are known—Orien maintains a network of teleportation circles, the dead can be raised, an oracle can cast Divination—but these things aren’t part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn’t expect to run into them. Magical effects of 6th level or higher are usually the product of more advanced civilizations—the dragons of Argonnessen, the elves of Aerenal, the ancient giants of Xen’drik. The same principle applies to magic items. Common and Uncommon items are part of everyday life. Rare items exist, but they’re rare. And Very Rare and Legendary items are typically the product of advanced civilizations or remarkable events.</p>
    <p>There are exceptions to this rule. There are higher-level spellcasters in the world: Mordain the Fleshweaver, Jaela Daran, the Great Druid Oalian. But civilization is built on a foundation of Common and Uncommon items, and spells of 3rd level and below. High-level spellcasters are capable of remarkable feats, but these can’t yet be mass produced.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Common Magic Items</h4>

    <p>Common magic items are common throughout Khorvaire. This isn’t to say they are trivial—Eberron: Rising from the Last War sets the price of a Common magic item at 2d4 × 10 GP, so even the simplest item will cost 20 GP. A farmer might treasure her Everbright Lantern and the gown of Clothes of Mending that has been in her family for generations, while a wealthy young noble may flaunt his Glamerweave and Cloak of Many Fashions.</p>
    <p>Common magic items generally aren’t all sold in one place. A high-class tailor will sell both mundane and magical clothes, but you can’t buy an Everbright Lantern at their shop. People don’t see these things as a separate class of “magic item”; they&apos;re simply the most effective tools of their type.</p>
    <p>Beyond this, consider that both in price and description, there’s a wide range of quality between items, reflected in the range of price. A 20 GP Everbright Lantern is ugly but functional, while for 80 GP you can get one inlaid with beautiful patterns, and you might even be able to adjust the shade and brilliance of the light source. Glamerweave is clothing that&apos;s been imbued with illusions: both the quality of the base clothing and the illusion factor into the cost, and the finest Glamerweave can be far more than 80 GP. In short, the magic item description tells you what a Common item does, but it’s also an object beyond that, and it’s good to think about its form and quality.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Uncommon Magic Items</h4>

    <p>Eberron: Rising from the Last War only calls out Common magic items, but at the DM’s discretion, Uncommon magic items can also be purchased in major cities (especially in Aundair). Such items are more expensive—the price is typically between 200-500 GP, set by the DM based on the power and quality of the item—but selection will be far more limited. Just because you could theoretically purchase a Cloak of Protection doesn’t mean one is always available in that particular shop or town. However, an exceptional weaponsmith may have a +1 Weapon for sale or take a commission to create one, and large House Sivis enclaves often sell Sending Stones. Ultimately, it&apos;s up to the DM to decide what sort of Uncommon magic items are available and who is selling them.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dragonmark Focus Items</h4>

    <p>Chapter 7 includes a list of dragonmark focus items. These represent that it’s easier to create an item that can only be used by someone with a dragonmark—presenting focus versions of other magic items, but with a reduced rarity. Dragonmark focus items can only be created by a character with the Mark of Making or the dragonmark used by the item; while they are more common than similar items that work for unmarked characters, they are typically only available through the dragonmarked houses and often only as rewards for house service.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Static Items</h4>

    <p>Most magic items are portable and designed for adventurers. However, you may also encounter magic items that are meant for industrial use. Just as a dragonmark focus item is easier to create because of its limitations, a large, immovable industrial item can make a Rare or Uncommon item’s properties accessible to the public. An Aundairian village may have a large Cleansing Stone set into the town square. If a theater has a magical tool that can generate Minor Illusion, it could be similar in size and shape to a pipe organ. Essentially, in thinking about the magical items that people may encounter, keep in mind that they aren’t necessarily designed for use in adventuring!</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Magewrights</h3>

    <p>The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the magewrights: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright only knows a few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they’re able to cast them in ways others cannot.</p>
    <p>An Artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren’t artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the Creation Forge), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn’t just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an Artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions.</p>
    <p>Just because you can create any Common magic item with little time and effort doesn’t mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, player characters are exceptional. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can’t match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Magewright Spells</h4>

    <p>For simplicity’s sake, Magewrights cast spells from the existing spell lists. But magewright spells are unique in a few ways. First of all, magewrights cast all their spells as Rituals—even spells that don’t normally have the Ritual tag. The drawback is that they can only be cast as Rituals with an extended casting time. All magewright spells have a minimum casting time of 10 minutes, and the DM can choose to give a spell an even longer casting time; it may take a medium a full hour to cast Speak with Dead.</p>
    <p>As magewrights can only cast spells as Rituals, they don’t use spell slots. But they do require a surge of magical energy to power the spell, typically generated by refined Eberron dragonshards, the fuel of arcane industry.</p>
    <p>When a magewright performs a Ritual, it consumes an amount of Eberron dragonshards worth 20 GP × the spell’s level, in addition to any costly Material components of the spell. This is the cost to the magewright to cast the spell; they might charge far more for offering that service to others, generally at least twice the casting cost. Following the general limitations of everyday magic, it’s unusual to encounter a magewright that can cast a spell of 4th level or higher, and any such magewright would likely charge a significant premium for their services.</p>
    <p>At DM discretion, a magewright’s spells may have expanded—or limited—effects. Consider what it takes to make a spell a viable commercial service. For example, Augury only allows the caster to predict events 30 minutes in the future—useful for adventurers in the midst of a dungeon, but not for the farmer wanting an opinion on planting crops. A professional oracle might be able to predict woe or weal anywhere from a day to a week in advance—but such an oracle could have very specific limitations, such as only being able to make predictions related to weather or agriculture. As a DM, use the existing spells as a model, but adjust them as necessary to create a viable business.</p>
    <p>Player characters can’t duplicate these effects. The unique aspects of magewright spells reflect both their devotion to a single subject and personal aptitude; the oracle has a unique talent for divination that even a diviner wizard can’t replicate. Player characters have unmatched potential and great versatility; magewrights are extremely limited, but have unique advantages.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Casual Cantrips</h4>

    <p>In Aerenal, almost every citizen knows a few cantrips. The Five Nations aren’t quite so advanced; there, cantrips are common, but still reflect specialized training. Most people rely on Common magic items; a magewright can be proud of their talents, though just as magewrights have a narrow spell selection, their cantrips are also more limited than those used by player characters. A magewright chef uses effects similar to Prestidigitation to heat and flavor food, but they can’t conjure illusions or extinguish flames. The idea is that the most versatile cantrips—such as Prestidigitation and Thaumaturgy—represent knowledge of a range of discrete spell effects, all categorized under one greater cantrip. Your spell list merely says Prestidigitation, but that encompasses a host of lesser cantrips; when you extinguish a fire, you’re actually casting Incendiary Purge, and when you chill your drink, you’re performing Culinary Transmutation.</p>
    <p>While this has no effect on player characters, consider that magewrights and other lesser spellcasters might only know limited forms of common cantrips, such as the following:</p>
    <p>Boldrei’s Broom. You clean an object or surface made from wood, stone, or metal no larger than 1 cubic foot.</p>
    <p>Culinary Transmutation. You chill or warm up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material.</p>
    <p>Grogan’s Grime. You soil an object or space no larger than 1 cubic foot.</p>
    <p>Halan’s Dramatic Entrance. You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window within 30 feet to fly open or slam shut.</p>
    <p>Incendiary Purge. You extinguish a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</p>
    <p>Kellan’s Kindling. You light a candle, torch, or small campfire.</p>
    <p>Phiarlan Whispers. You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within 30 feet, such as a rumble of thunder, the hooting of an owl, or ominous whispers.</p>
    <p>Shol Flame. You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.</p>
    <p>Tialaen Tongue. Your voice is up to three times as loud as normal for up to one minute.</p>
    <p>Verran’s Textile Restoration. You clean an object made of cloth or leather no larger than 1 cubic foot.</p>
    <p>Zolan Zest. You flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material; this lasts for one hour.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Magewrights in Action</h4>

    <p>Magewrights weave magic into their work. They are not only limited spellcasters, but skilled professionals who use magic as a tool. In addition to a limited range of magic ability, magewrights are also skilled in the mundane aspects of their specialty. A magewright chef doesn’t make food by snapping their fingers; they’re skilled with Cook’s Utensils, as well as using Culinary Transmutation and Zolan Zest as tools in their repertoire. Below are a few examples of magewright professions.</p>
    <p>Arcane Locksmith. Locksmiths are typically trained by the Warding Guild of House Kundarak, and most people expect a locksmith to be a dwarf. An arcane locksmith is proficient with Thieves’ Tools and Tinker’s Tools, using these for most of their work. They can cast Arcane Lock and Knock as Rituals. When casting these Rituals, they use Tinker’s Tools as an Arcane Focus, tracing symbols and sprinkling powdered dragonshards over the object to be locked or unlocked.</p>
    <p>Artisan. Blacksmith, cobbler, or cooper, a typical artisan is proficient with their tools and learns Mending and Magecraft. The Magecraft cantrip allows them to enchant their tools and supplies, creating the perfect conditions for their work. Most receive this training from the Fabricator’s Guild of House Cannith, but others apprentice with local magewrights, while adepts cast Magecraft by invoking Onatar or the Traveler.</p>
    <p>Healer. Professional healers are usually trained by House Jorasco. A healer is proficient with Medicine and Herbalism Kits, using these to treat common injuries. They know the cantrips Spare the Dying and Detect Poison and Disease, and can perform Lesser Restoration as a Ritual, but the Ritual uses the Herbalism Kit as a focus and includes the trappings of mundane healing. They don’t just snap their fingers to cure people; they use pinches of herbs and tap glands and pressure points.</p>
    <p>Medium. No dragonmarked house trains mediums. Instead, some come from communities steeped in the Blood of Vol, while others are Vassals who invoke Aureon and the Keeper. A medium performs Speak with Dead as a Ritual, and many use a form of Minor Illusion to conjure up an image of the deceased in conjunction with the ritual. Some less-scrupulous mediums rely on Insight, History, or Deception to simulate speaking with the dead without going through the full ritual.</p>
    <p>Oracle. Every oracle has a preferred method of divination. Some use cards, others use bones or dice. The bread and butter of the oracle is Augury. As noted earlier in this chapter, most oracles can use Augury to make predictions stretching further into the future than the spell normally allows, but they may be limited in the subjects they can predict—some oracles only make predictions related to agriculture, while others discuss romance. Greater oracles may have the ability to cast Divination, but this requires the oracle to have a connection to a spiritual guide. A religious adept will deal with a celestial tied to their faith, while a secular oracle may deal with a fiend or other spirit.</p>
    <p>Truthteller. Licensed by the Warning Guild of House Medani, truthtellers are proficient in Insight and can cast Zone of Truth as a Ritual. The Ritual casting includes a lengthy invocation and chalk symbols traced across the area of effect. The truthteller knows if someone succeeds or fails their saving throw, and encourages them to voluntarily submit to the Ritual; thus, saving against it will be seen as an attempt to evade questioning.</p>
    <p>The above are just a few examples of magewrights. A launderer uses Verran’s Textile Restoration to clean the toughest stains, while a professional stagehand uses Phiarlan Whispers or Shol Flame to add details to a performance. The critical element is to see these things are part of their profession. They aren’t dropping everything to cast a spell; the spell is incorporated into the way in which they perform their job.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">What About Adepts?</h4>

    <p>Arcane magic is a science—magewrights master its techniques. However, there are other forms of magic which can likewise be adapted to everyday functions. An adept derives their magic from their faith, a more limited form of what a cleric can do; similarly, a gleaner masters the simplest forms of druidic magic. Especially with the adept, this is more of a calling than a job; you don’t decide to become an oracle of Aureon, you find that you are gifted with visions. The rituals of an adept invoke divine forces, while a gleaner draws on the world around them and often uses an Herbalism Kit as a Spellcasting Focus. Adepts are common in Thrane and other religious communities, while gleaners provide useful services in the Eldeen Reaches.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Magical Services</h3>

    <p>This section supplements the list of magical services presented in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, offering a few additional services as well as options for some existing ones.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Entertainment</h4>

    <p>Most theaters employ illusions to add special effects to a performance, whether provided by magewrights or static items. Dream parlors provide entirely illusory entertainment. House Phiarlan’s latest innovation is the Crystal Theater. A large device uses a tiny scrying crystal to project an image on a screen. The crystal is tied to a single location—one of the grand stages in House Phiarlan’s central demesnes. This allows the patrons of a crystal theater to watch a live performance occurring on a distant stage. As this practice expands, this could provide entertainers and bards with a global reach; Phiarlan might even pay adventurers to license the rights to dramatize their exploits.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cosmetic Transmutation</h4>

    <p>One form of fashion that hasn’t been discussed in depth is the practice of cosmetic transmutation. A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations—for a price.</p>
    <p>Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you’re dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent. The more complicated the transmutation, the more costly—and hard to find—the service becomes.</p>

  </table>

    <p>Minor (Natural). Simple transmutation can temporarily change the color of your hair, skin, or eyes within the standard parameters for your species.</p>
    <p>Minor (Unusual). If you’re seeking unnatural effects—cat’s eyes or moving tattoos—you’ll need a highly skilled beautician.</p>
    <p>Moderate. Significant physical transformation allows you to alter your weight, height, or sex. These substantial transmutations require an expert in their trade.</p>
    <p>Major. Specialized or exotic physical transformation can match the appearance of a specific individual or change your apparent species. While this alters your appearance, you don’t gain the traits associated with your selected form. Those seeking to imitate another’s appearance must be wary. Duplicating the appearance of another person is a crime under the Code of Galifar—malicious theft of identity—and even those who can perform the magic won’t do so without good reason.</p>
    <p>It’s always up to the DM to decide what services are available in any given community, and as with any magewright, beauticians are often specialized; a hairdresser might be able to give you permanent silver hair but be unable to change any other feature. In Sharn, Transmutation in Upper Tavick’s Landing and The Veil of Flesh in Upper Northedge are salons that specialize in cosmetic transmutation. A House Jorasco clinic can help with gender transition, shaping muscle tone, and similar services, while the criminal Tyrants of Tavick’s Landing are the masters of exotic physical transformation.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Medicine</h4>

    <p>As noted in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, nonmagical care is the basic service provided by House Jorasco. If you have the gold, Lesser Restoration can provide instant relief from common diseases. Larger healing houses can provide Greater Restoration, and the finest can even raise the dead.</p>
    <p>But that’s where complications arise. It’s up to the DM to decide how easy it is to be raised from the dead. If it suits the story, this can be a simple and reliable service, performed by a player character, Jorasco medic, or religious adept. However, it could also be dangerous. As discussed in chapter 5, raising someone from the dead draws their spirit back from Dolurrh; this might catch the attention of a Dolurrhi Marut, or even bring back the wrong spirit, causing a Ghost to manifest or ending up with a hostile personality in your friend’s body. Most religions hold that raising the dead defies fate. If you share these concerns, it’s common practice to cast Augury before Raise Dead; if the result is “woe,” the request for resurrection is rejected. So player characters might return from the dead— because they do have destinies to fulfill—but bear in mind that being raised from the dead is about more than just having 750 GP, and that even nobles may not be able to return.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Transportation</h4>

    <p>The prices of transportation may seem prohibitively expensive for commoners or poor adventurers. Airship travel is new and expensive, but when traveling by elemental galleon or lightning rail more inexpensive fares are available. Eberron: Rising from the Last War lists a price of 5 SP per mile, which represents the finest quality of travel, equivalent to a stay at an inn of Wealthy or Aristocratic quality. However, the standard fare is 2 SP per mile, which is Modest to Comfortable in its appointments. Those on a budget can book passage in steerage for only 2 CP per mile, but this is typically Squalid or Poor in quality, and a long journey can be dangerous. Depending on their reputation, adventurers may also be able to exchange services for their passage, whether working as security or employing useful skills.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the listed speeds of water and air transport represent the average rate of travel on a standard-fare vessel. Both Orien and Lyrandar have prototype vehicles capable of significantly higher speeds; however, travel on such vessels is both more expensive and dangerous.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Manifest Zones</h3>

    <p>Manifest zones are areas where the influence of the other planes bleeds through into the Material Plane. Eberron: Rising from the Last War presents some possible manifest zone effects, and chapter 5 of this book explores these in more depth. Some manifest zones are dangerous, and such regions are shunned. However, other manifest zones have effects that can be quite useful for commerce or industry, and like any natural resource, these tend to be harnessed over time. The towers of Sharn are made possible by the manifest zone to Syrania, and any other city with a similar zone could support skycoaches and high towers. Lamannian manifest zones often promote fertility and growth, and many of the greatest farms and vineyards in Khorvaire are in such zones. Ultimately, this is one more factor in the wide magic of Khorvaire: it’s not simply what spells can be cast, it’s that there are places in the world itself that are inherently magical.</p>
    <h2 class="compendium-hr">Artificers: <br /> Invention and Innovation</h2>
    <p>Arcane magic is a science. Wizards use words of power and mystic gestures, but there are many ways to channel arcane energies—suspended in the liquid of a potion, trapped in the sigils of a scroll, or focused through a wand.</p>
    <p>The Artificer is an arcane engineer; instead of working directly with mystical energy, they use tools to perform wonders. In a world where wandslingers take to the battlefields and airships sail through the skies, Artificers are innovators and inventors developing tools to shape the future. Chapter 6 presents two new Artificer subclasses, representing the diversity of artifice styles and specializations.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Style of Artifice</h3>

    <p>As an Artificer, you possess remarkable talents. You don’t need the eldritch machines or vast resources that are traditionally involved in arcane industry, and can produce magical effects using just your personal tools. But what’s the foundation of your magic? Are you building on the basic principles used by House Cannith or exploring less traditional paths of arcane science?</p>
    <p>The Artificer Techniques table presents a few ideas. Use one of these or develop your own, considering how this affects your appearance and the way you cast your spells. Your unique style doesn’t have to change any of the default rules associated with your magic. For example, you may say that you’re working with principles of mundane science, but your spells will still be negated by Counterspell. Find creative ways to explain how your character’s techniques interact with game rules. Perhaps some of your theories are completely false; while you believe that you’re producing magical effects by talking to spirits or using Thelanian logic, it’s possible you’ve stumbled on a different way to trigger traditional arcane reactions. If you want to explore mechanical advantages and limitations based on your unusual techniques, discuss it with your DM.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Tools of Magic</h3>

    <p>When you cast an Artificer spell, you follow the same rules as other spellcasters—but what are you doing when you use your action to produce a magical effect? You aren’t praying for divine intervention, invoking a supernatural patron, or producing a ball of fire with words and gestures. To cast spells, you must be holding a tool you’re proficient with—why? Because you’re using that tool and its associated skills to produce magical effects. If you’re using Alchemist’s Supplies to cast Cure Wounds, you aren’t just poking someone with a beaker; you’re mixing a healing salve.</p>
    <p>Think about what your tools actually are. Artisan’s Tools are an abstract concept—10 pounds of assorted objects and supplies, not just a singular tool. You may have a satchel holding them or a bandolier of pouches. If you use Tinker’s Tools to create an effect, what specific tools are you using, and how? Some of the most common tools of artifice are discussed below, but you can cast spells using any Artisan’s Tool you’re familiar with. You could even perform your alchemy using Brewer’s Supplies or Cook’s Utensils; why drink a potion when you could eat a magical pie?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Alchemist&apos;s Supplies</h4>

    <p>The challenge of creating an alchemical potion is in suspending the mystical chemical reaction for later consumption. It’s much easier to trigger an instant effect, and that’s what you’re doing when you cast your spells. Your Fire Bolt could be a thrown flask, Poison Spray is flinging foul substances. Cure Wounds, False Life, and Water Breathing could be potions you mix and serve on the spot. Disguise Self or Alter Self could be magical cosmetics.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Calligrapher&apos;s Supplies</h4>

    <p>Sigilry channels arcane power through symbols and sound, using special inks and techniques. As with alchemy, it’s much easier to produce an instant effect than to suspend and sustain it as a scroll. When you cast Fire Bolt, perhaps you use your quill to trace the name of fire in the air before you; or you might have the sigil written down and you just read it to produce the effect. Whether you draw sigils onto things or craft simple scrolls and read them, your pen is mightier than most swords.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cartographer&apos;s Supplies</h4>

    <p>This is a twist on the sigilist, and you could use your tools in the same way, drawing arcane glyphs. Or, more exotically, you could specialize in calculating ley lines and the relationships between the planes. The world is filled with micro-manifest zones waiting to be triggered; you’re using your tools to calculate the proper alignments to channel the planar energies you need.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Painter&apos;s Supplies</h4>

    <p>If you want to be fanciful about it, you could paint what you need into reality. When you Cure Wounds, you’re literally painting over the injury; when you cast Fire Bolt, you paint the flame in the air and it flies toward your opponent. This is a variation of sigilry, but the same underlying principles apply. You might even create scrolls that are images rather than words.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Thieves&apos; Tools</h4>

    <p>Artificers are proficient with both Thieves’ Tools and Tinker’s Tools, and you use them in similar ways. Thieves’ Tools include picks and other fine manipulators. You don’t cast Fire Bolt by pointing a lockpick at someone; but you could use it to clear a problematic valve on a dragon-pistol you made with Tinker’s Tools.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tinker&apos;s Tools</h4>

    <p>You can justify all manner of odd gadgets with Tinker’s Tools, putting together a prototype that becomes part of your toolkit. A dragon-shaped sidearm could produce Fire Bolt or a modified gauntlet could deliver Shocking Grasp. These unstable prototypes can’t be used by anyone else, needing constant tinkering to keep them working. So you always carry your tools, and to cast a spell, a “tool” must be in hand—but it can be a dragon-gun, as opposed to pliers. You might cast Cure Wounds using a tiny metal spider you’ve tinkered; while it looks like a mundane clockwork construct, magic lets it move and think. Mundane engineering is part of a tinker’s creations, but magic makes them work.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Woodcarver&apos;s Tools</h4>

    <p>Wands, Staffs, and Rods are some of the most basic forms of Arcane Focus. If you perform magic with Woodcarver’s Tools, you aren’t actually blasting someone with a saw. Instead, you are using experimental, exotic, or temporary Wands or Rods. As with Tinker’s Tools, you have to have a tool in your hand and you have to possess Woodcarver’s Tools to perform your magic, but the exact nature of which tool is in your hand is up to you. It could appear to be a traditional Wand, or you could have come up with a new revolutionary form of Wand, Staff, or Rod.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr">Spell Preparation <br /> and Item Replication</h3>
    <p>As an Artificer, you prepare spells during a Long Rest, but it’s not like a Wizard reading a book. It’s about assembling the specialized supplies and tools you need for the things you want to do. A sigilist can’t create a scroll with just any ink, but has entirely different inks based on the type of effects they’re going to produce. Likewise, an alchemist prepares special reagents that combine to produce spell effects. If you use Tinker’s Tools, you’re creating and fine-tuning your gadgets. You can’t create a dragon-pistol in six seconds; you prepare the pistol during your rest, and when you cast a spell, you’re simply loading enchanted ammunition or triggering the arcane sigils you set in place.</p>
    <p>This also explains the idea of spell slots. The reagents you’ve prepared are tricky to produce and don’t last forever. You’re preparing as much as you can, but once you go through all your mystic inks, you can’t produce another scroll effect until you have a few hours to work on it. Effectively, your spells use temporary magic items that only you can use, created during a long rest.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, you also have the ability to create longer-lasting tools that you can share with your companions. Artificers create magic items, but to maintain class balance, you can’t flood the party with them; it’s up to you what you do with this limited resource.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Firearms and Homunculi</h3>

    <p>Artillerists produce Eldritch Cannons and arcane firearms. Battle Smiths make Steel Defenders. Any Artificer can craft a homunculus companion. But what are these? Are Artillerists wielding guns like those of our own world? Not necessarily.</p>
    <p>These items are “arcane” and “eldritch.” Much as the primary form of arcane artillery is the Siege Staff, the Artillerist uses Woodcarver’s Tools, turning “a Rod, Staff, or Wand into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.” So you’re a specialized wandslinger with improved Wands, Staffs, and Rods. You choose their appearance—a wand, a specialized hand crossbow, a flintlock pistol, a tiny metal dragon, or any aesthetic you like. “Arcane firearm” doesn’t necessarily mean “handgun.”</p>
    <p>While the name “Eldritch Cannon” sounds like a massive piece of artillery, an Eldritch Cannon is either Small or Tiny, possibly small enough to hold in your hand. What does it look like, and does it have legs? Is it an animated ballista? A small Siege Staff? A tiny brass dragon that breathes fire on your enemies?</p>
    <p>The same principle applies to a homunculi’s appearance. Consider your style and the tools that you use for your magic. Your Homunculus Servant can deliver your Touch spells, but how? If you use Painter’s Supplies to perform your magic, your homunculus could be a tiny humanoid paintbrush, a floating palette, or even a creature made out of living paint. An alchemist’s homunculus could be a tiny cauldron or a little humanoid creature made from glass and beakers.</p>
    <p>Through all of these, the mechanics don’t change. The shape of your arcane firearm makes no difference in combat rules; what it changes is the story that you’re telling. What’s interesting about your Artificer? What does your homunculus say about you?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Backgrounds Ideas</h3>

    <p>You’ve developed your style and chosen your tools. But how and where did you develop your skills? Do you have a connection to an established order of artificers? Consider these ways your background could reflect your experience as an Artificer.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Wage Mage (Artisan)</h4>

    <p>You worked your way up in House Cannith or the Arcane Congress, studying at a trade school and working in an industrial forgehold. While you’ve abandoned the factory in favor of adventure, you still have strong ties in the Fabricator’s Guild.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Siege Engineer (Soldier)</h4>

    <p>You operated and maintained the engines of war. What nation did you serve? Are you proud of your service, or haunted by your deeds? Did you serve and retire with distinction—or are you a folk hero who deserted to help innocents?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Savant (Sage)</h4>

    <p>You don’t do well with authority. You may have started with Arcanix or the Twelve, but you were thrown out after challenging the system one too many times. You’re brilliant—but determined to find your own path.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Natural (Wayfarer)</h4>

    <p>You’ve never studied arcane science, but you have an intuitive talent for artifice. Perhaps you grew up on battlefields, scavenging parts from warforged titans or shattered floating fortresses. Your work isn’t pretty—and often seems like it shouldn’t work—yet you can do things no magewright can match.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Technical Support (Criminal)</h4>

    <p>You provided arcane assistance to an organization operating out of the public eye. Did you serve with the Royal Eyes of Aundair or the King’s Citadel of Breland, crafting Common items for agents? Or was it a shadier operation like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan? Why did you shift to a life of adventure? What pieces of your old life could come back to haunt you?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Bastions of Artifice</h3>

    <p>If you’re an Artisan, what guild did you work with? When you buy a Wand of Magic Missiles in Sharn, who made it? Here are some institutions that employ or train artificers, factions that could be tied to your background or play a role in an adventure.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Arcane Congress &amp; Arcanix (Aundair)</h4>

    <p>Throughout the golden age of Galifar, the Arcane Congress delved into magical mysteries for the good of all. Today, it only serves the people of Aundair, yet remains the largest institute of both wizardry and artifice outside of House Cannith. The Arcane Congress was largely devoted to the war effort, but it has also continued to develop Common magic items and other magical tools to improve the daily life of people in Aundair.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Daashor (Darguun)</h4>

    <p>The Heirs of Dhakaan maintain their own ancient tradition of artifice, which is discussed in chapters 4 and 6.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">House Cannith (International)</h4>

    <p>House Cannith is the single largest source of artifice in the Five Nations, providing training through its trade schools and employing magewrights and artificers in its factories and forgeholds. The Fabricator’s Guild creates both magical and mundane goods, while the loosely organized Tinker’s Guild focuses on maintenance and repair. While Cannith has a broad range of expertise, Cannith West in Aundair excels at alchemy, Cannith South in Breland has the edge in general industry, and Cannith East specializes in artillery and dabbles in necromancy.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Crucible (Thrane)</h4>

    <p>Developed during the Last War, this small order of adepts and artificers crafts items drawing on the power of the Silver Flame.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Military</h4>

    <p>Every nation employed enhanced and arcane artillery in the war, along with battle magic. While most relied heavily on House Cannith, every nation has its own program researching military applications of magic, along with a corps of magewrights trained to operate artillery. Adventurers could run up against ambitious military artificers whose ambitions stretch beyond their skills.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Onatar&apos;s Chosen (Five Nations)</h4>

    <p>In a parallel to the cults of the Traveler, this secret order of magewrights and artificers believe they’re directly inspired by the Sovereign Onatar. Members can be found scattered throughout the other organizations in this section. Onatar’s Chosen believe that artifice should serve the greater good, and they seek to drive their organizations toward such positive purposes.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tasker&apos;s Dream (House Sivis)</h4>

    <p>This elite think tank focuses on developing new and improved forms of communication, both through enhancing existing tools such as the Speaking Stone, and pioneering new techniques.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Traveler Cults (Five Nations)</h4>

    <p>These cults are a dark reflection of Onatar’s Chosen. Followers of the Traveler are found in most organizations in this section, with a strong presence in House Cannith. Traveler cultists pursue innovation at all costs, creating weapons or tools that could shatter the existing balance of power or cause chaos in other ways. Some outsiders believe airships (which cause strife between Orien and Lyrandar) and warforged may have been created by these cultists—and many blame the Traveler for the Mourning.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Twelve (Karrnath)</h4>

    <p>While House Cannith is the primary source of general industry, the Twelve focuses on cooperation between all of the dragonmarked houses. The Kundarak vault network was developed here, along with most tools that draw on the specialties of multiple houses.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Zil Binders (Zilargo)</h4>

    <p>The Zil elemental binding industry is an important source of magewrights and artificers, especially those following the path of planar influence. This isn’t a monolithic organization; there are six major families involved in binding. The Zil consider their binding techniques to be an important national resource, and are unlikely to train anyone other than a gnome.</p>

<aside>
    <p>Breath of Siberys</p>
    <p>Wondrous Item, Common</p>
    <p>Arcane artillery requires a powerful surge of magical energy to fuel the attack. Wizards and other spellcasters can prime arcane artillery by expending a spell slot, but bombardiers don’t have spell slots. Instead, a bombardier charges the weapon by using the Breath of Siberys—a small globe containing a highly refined solution of dragonshards held in a suspended state. While priming arcane artillery, the operator crushes the Breath of Siberys against an engraved brass plate; the sphere dissolves and the weapon is charged.</p>
    <p>House Cannith has been developing traditional staffs that can be charged using Breath of Siberys. It takes a Magic action to dissolve the breath on the charging plate, restoring 1d4 charges to the staff. Cannith artificers are working to adapt other charged items to use Breath of Siberys.</p>

    <p>The Scale of Damage</p>
    <p>At first glance, the damage associated with many weapons described here may seem low. How is it that a massive Siege Staff could end up dealing less damage than a Staff of Fire? But in developing weapons of war, consider who those weapons are targeting. The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the Guard or Bandit stat block, both of which have 11 Hit Points. When large numbers were called for, nations would employ peasant levies, most of whom would use the Commoner stat block with a mere 4 Hit Points.</p>
    <p>Hit Points are an abstract concept, a “combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.” That range of 4-11 Hit Points is normal; a typical person on the street could be mortally wounded by a single well-placed crossbow bolt. The high Hit Points of exceptional individuals—such as player characters—reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.</p>
    <p>So consider the Fireball spell. It has a range of 150 feet, affects a 20-foot Sphere, and deals 8d6 Fire damage. This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you’re fighting 120 guards with Longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your Fireball. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 Hit Points). Fireball is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The Siege Staff may not inflict as much damage as a Staff of Fire, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.</p>
    <p>This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn’t want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a Siege Staff; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of Fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. 3d6 damage may feel low because it won’t kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are.</p>

    <p>Telling Time: Chronal Cantrips</p>
    <p>The people of Eberron don’t use mechanical clocks, and if you’re in a Mror mine or the heart of one of Sharn’s towers, you can’t see the sun. So how do you tell time?</p>
    <p>The answer is simple: magic. There are a wide range of cantrips that tell time—some tied to an absolute time, some tied to the moons, some set to a local time. In Eberron, any character that has the skill to cast Prestidigitation, Thaumaturgy, or Druidcraft can produce an additional effect allowing them to tell time. Clocks in Eberron are Common magic items, and in most major cities, bells are rung to identify the hour; three bells means “three o’clock.” An Orb of Time is another Common magic item—a small polished stone disk, often connected to a chain like a pocket watch—that tells time.</p>
