    <p>Dela could feel the mind flayer’s hatred, inflaming the anger of the crowd around her. His thoughts washed over her as he made his announcement to the gathered monsters. Outsiders came to Graywall, scheming to steal an ancient treasure from our governor’s palace. These arrogant easterners have been taken into custody, and within the hour they’ll fight their first match in the arena. Who will stand as the champions of Graywall? Who will spill the blood of the East?</p>
    <p>The crowd around Dela roared as one. The minotaur in front of her raised his axe—made on a Karrnathi forge, from the look of it—and bellowed his righteous fury. Dela was glad for the illusion that made those around her see her as an orc; this was a bad moment to be the only human in the crowd.</p>
    <p>A sudden sense of calm silenced the mind flayer’s rage. It was Gentle; the kalashtar’s telepathic projection momentarily shielded Dela from the governor’s wider projection. Do not fear, Dela. We’ll save them.</p>
    <p>The nations of Galifar have been detailed in many books, from Five Nations to Sharn: City of Towers, with relatively little attention given to other areas. This chapter delves into four regions and cultures that have never been explored in depth: Droaam, a nation of creatures most humans consider to be monsters; the goblinoid Heirs of Dhakaan, keepers of an ancient legacy; the dwarves of the Mror Holds, caught in a conflict with the terrifying daelkyr; and the denizens of the Thunder Sea.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Droaam</h2>

    <p>Of all the new nations to rise from the Last War, Droaam is both the youngest and most exotic. It is an alliance of creatures often seen as monsters, founded by villains who stepped out of storybook tales. Denied recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold, Droaam remains an enigma. How did this nation come to be, and what could draw adventurers to it?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Droaamish History</h3>

    <p>For the last millennium, children of the Five Nations have known the fate awaiting the naughty: they’ll be sent to the Barrens, where ogres will use them for footstools until the trolls eat them for dinner.</p>
    <p>When Galifar was established, the province of Breland was granted dominion over all lands south of the Byeshk Mountains and west of the Seawall, extending to the waters of the Thunder Sea. This bold claim considerably extended the territory held by the preceding nation of Wroat—but it was nothing more than a claim. The Brelish people had no need of the lands to the west, nor did they want them. The Barrens—their name for everything west of the Graywall Mountains—were known to hold foul swamps and barren plains, an untamed region filled with all manner of deadly monsters. Explorers to Breland’s newly acquired territory soon confirmed these tales. The plains were filled with goblins and hungry gnolls. The mountains were home to harpies whose songs could lead the unwary into deep chasms, where trolls slept on piles of bones. The Barrens had nothing the Brelish believed worth fighting for, and so it was left alone. Occasionally, questing knights or bold templars would cross the Graywall to battle giants and slay ogres, but the region was largely ignored. Over centuries, the Brelish slowly expanded west toward the Graywall. Castle Arakhain became a favored royal residence in the eighth century, bringing new prosperity to Ardev and Shavalant. However, the ensuing wave of western settlers was met by fierce raiders crossing the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake. Bloodied settlers brought back tales of bellowing minotaurs, orcs, ogres, and goblins lurking in every shadow. An attack at Castle Arakhain led to the brief Westward War, the might of Galifar driving the raiders back across the Graywall and obliterating many of the marauding bands. The fortress Orcbone was established as the gate between the people of Breland and the monsters of the Barrens, and the king founded the Westwind Riders to patrol the border. The Riders held the line throughout the ninth century, and Brelish settlers even staked claims along the Graywall. This period peaked with the founding of the fortress-town of Stubborn in the foothills (now known as Stonejaw). Then the Last War changed everything.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">An Ancient Land</h4>

    <p>The land known as the Barrens is far older than Galifar or Wroat. While less fertile than the fields of Breland or Aundair, this region holds rich mineral deposits. Some believe it was the original homeland of the goblinoids, a theory supported by a significant number of Dhakaani ruins along and below the mountain ranges, as well as below the Great Crag itself. In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.</p>
    <p>The region was dominated by anarchy from then on—some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region’s inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization—the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost—but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as “chieftain,” but it literally means “boss” or “big person”—and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll—a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader—a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni—would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The War Begins</h4>

    <p>As the Last War began, the harpies held the Byeshk Mountains, where their flights endlessly feuded. Cazhaak Draal was in the hands of the medusas that claimed it centuries earlier. Wise creatures knew to avoid the Watching Woods, home to worgs and worse. In the plains, the strongest leader was the minotaur warlord Rhesh Toraa; around her keep, countless minor chibs fought one another more frequently than they struck the settlers.</p>
    <p>The first days of the Last War led to a reduction of forces in the west of Breland; while it was a violent, unstable region, there were few settlers across the Graywall needing protection. Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan’s coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster. She reduced the Westwind Riders to a minimal force—enough to patrol between the fortresses of Orcbone and Stubborn, but little more.</p>
    <p>Many Aundairians had been part of the Westwind Riders, and on receiving their reports, Spy Master ir’Galanatyr saw an opportunity. The Royal Eyes of Aundair worked with Rhesh Toraa and other chibs in the Barrens, providing equipment and training to support attacks against Graywall settlers and raids across the gap. With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west. But ultimately, the provocateurs from Aundair and Karrnath found the Barrens raiders undisciplined and impossible to unify, never posing the dire threat Breland’s enemies had hoped for.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Daughters Arrive</h4>

    <p>The fortress-town of Stubborn survived decades of raids and skirmishes, as the chibs of the Barrens had no patience for sieges and no weapons for breaking strong walls. Many lesser settlements and claims were overrun and lost, but Stubborn repelled countless attacks by goblins and minotaurs. However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn’s defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies’ songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones. Survivors were herded into the plains to face the leaders of the army; this was the first recorded encounter with the assembled Daughters of Sora Kell, three enigmatic hags discussed in depth later in this chapter.</p>
    <p>“Tell your rulers there’s a new power in the west,” Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. “What you’ve called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.”</p>
    <p>Once news of the fall of Stubborn reached Orcbone, the Westwind Riders traveled west in full force. But Sora Katra was true to her word; there were no survivors. A retaliatory strike from Droaam—merely a fraction of the forces at Stubborn—inflicted terrible damage on Orcbone itself. King Boranel swiftly deployed all the soldiers he could spare to this new front, reinforcing and fortifying Orcbone. In 987 YK, he formally ordered all Brelish citizens to withdraw from the lands west of Graywall, but he refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Daughters, and over the next decade, clashes continued.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Building A Nation</h4>

    <p>To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere—and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya’s Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya’s Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved—that Maenya’s lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation—but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.</p>
    <p>Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with—and dominated—the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.</p>
    <p>In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region’s most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient—when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters—Maenya’s Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.</p>
    <p>The Daughters’ ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam—at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. Gargoyle and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn, and the Gargoyle even replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Present Situation</h4>

    <p>The Daughters of Sora Kell sent representatives to Thronehold for the treaty negotiations, demanding to be recognized as a sovereign nation. This petition was denied. In practice, Droaam is a nation, and most recent maps include its name and mark its territory. But legally, the land is still part of Breland. It’s debatable whether the Droaamites are legally invaders or rebels defying the Brelish crown, but either way, they aren’t considered citizens of Breland and aren’t entitled to the protections of the Code of Galifar. However, their standing outside the law makes them a haven for war criminals, dissidents, deserters, and others who can find no place in the Five Nations.</p>
    <p>Most of the leaders of the Five Nations are convinced that Droaam won’t last—that it’s unstable, that these monsters will turn on each other any day now. They might be right; the Daughters have already had to crush a number of rebellious warlords and lesser chibs. But after eleven years, Droaam is stronger than ever. Its new cities are expanding. Dragonmarked houses are exploring their opportunities in the region. One important question still remains unanswered: What do the Daughters of Sora Kell want? Will they attack Breland in force if their demands aren’t soon met? Or is there some grander scheme, tied to the prophetic visions of Sora Teraza?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">What Defines Droaam?</h3>

    <p>While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride—driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. “Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we’ve done in one decade, and imagine what we’ll achieve in the next!”</p>
    <p>Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs—miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn’t yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it’s easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there’s much change yet to come.</p>
    <p>While many outsiders may think Droaam’s system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist—ground meat made of troll flesh—that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they’re building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder—the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they’ll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they’ll build something glorious.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Language</h4>

    <p>Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.</p>
    <p>When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen’drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it’s nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa’ran orcs that still speak it.</p>
    <p>Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it’s up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common—and if so, just how much it speaks. It’s possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma (Performance) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.</p>
    <p>Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.</p>
    <p>While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren’t dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in muut or atcha, and don’t use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don’t use the terms chaat’oor or gath’dar to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use aravaat—easterner—to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don’t bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that’s all most people really care to know about it.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Political Structure</h4>

    <p>The nation of Droaam, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it’s constantly evolving. The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment’s notice. As it stands, Droaam has been split into lheshat—a Goblin term meaning “domain of a warlord.” Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.</p>
    <p>For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won’t own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city—though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent.</p>
    <p>Katra’s vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse—foremen shouldn’t beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin’dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn’t always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it’s balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.</p>
    <p>In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:</p>
    <p><strong>Katra’s Voice.</strong> The agents of Katra’s Voice are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra’s Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.</p>
    <p><strong>Maenya’s Fist.</strong> A few elite soldiers of Maenya’s Fist usually accompany an emissary of Katra’s Voice; if the Voice can’t soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.</p>
    <p><strong>Teraza’s Eye.</strong> The agents of Teraza’s Eye are sages, versed in the region’s history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg—that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.</p>
    <p>These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, “I am Teraza’s Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here.”</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Law and Order</h4>

    <p>Droaam isn’t bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra’s Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa’aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don’t mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don’t care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don’t care if someone stole your purse. They aren’t interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers—anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won’t interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall—but they also won’t interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.</p>
    <p>In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.</p>
    <p>There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra’s Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it—but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice—but it’s a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.</p>
    <p>Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor’chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.</p>
    <p>A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don’t interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn’t as common as outsiders think. There’s an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; everyone clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra’s plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She’ll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her—he needs to know better—but she won’t go out of her way to kill him, and she won’t eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don’t interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cruel World</h4>

    <p>Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There’s little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you’ll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey—and it’s always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.</p>
    <p>Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it’s because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it’s the only life you’ve known.</p>
    <p>This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you’ll have food and shelter. But that’s all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that’s a perfectly reasonable arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Economy</h4>

    <p>Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary “currencies.” Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It’s also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it’s from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won’t accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth—so you can’t just carve “wyvern” on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage—”the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver”—adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn’t threaten the people of Droaam—or is perhaps even an ally—there won’t be a bounty on its teeth.</p>
    <p>While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it’s also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can’t make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter—any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.</p>
    <p>Droaam’s main exports—brokered through House Tharashk—are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron dragonshards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it’s also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon’s blood is described in chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user Advantage against saving throws to avoid the Frightened condition; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim’s life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can’t be found anywhere else. It’s a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!</p>
    <p>In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the Droaamish Artisanship table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they’re skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Religion</h4>

    <p>Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned King, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury’s voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron’s cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Demesne believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.</p>
    <p>Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed—an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.</p>
    <p>The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered “monsters” by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa’s gaze, the troll’s regeneration, the ogre’s strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.</p>
    <p>Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find your path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she’ll guide you through them; she’s also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice’s coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species—from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.</p>
    <p>All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign’s hoard; likewise, it’s customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn’t grow jealous.</p>
    <p>Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don’t interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don’t argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that’s sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren’t upset if you invoke Aureon, and don’t care what kalashtar or elves believe.</p>
    <p>There’s one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam—the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered “supernatural threats.” The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won’t soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it’s wise to never wander off alone.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cuisine</h4>

    <p>Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn’t feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam’s inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren’t lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.</p>
    <p>While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra’s Voice and Maenya’s Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the “grist mills” have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish—for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn’t eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that’s blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.</p>
    <p>Every major town has a “grist mill”—a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate—though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily—stew, sausage, meat broth—but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it’s free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew— there’s plenty more where it came from!</p>
    <p>For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Wide Monster</h4>

    <p>It’s commonly said that Eberron is “wide magic, not high magic.” The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society—communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster—finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa’s gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Harpy Song.</strong> The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted “songbird” can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.</p>
    <p><strong>Medicine.</strong> The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it’s not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with Troll’s Blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is “suck it up,” but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce Troll’s Blood, it could revolutionize public health.</p>
    <p><strong>Brute Force.</strong> With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Denizens of Droaam</h3>

    <p>The population of Droaam is staggeringly diverse. In addition to the sentient creatures that are part of this culture, the region is home to a remarkable number of monstrosities and exotic beasts. In part, this is due to the ancient influence of the daelkyr and the more modern experiments of Mordain the Fleshweaver. There are a considerable number of manifest zones in the area, along with passages to Khyber. But most of all, this has been a frontier for thousands of years. The central region of Khorvaire has long been home to powerful civilizations, and over time, its people actively worked to eliminate dangerous threats. Some monsters were exterminated, while others were driven away—and Droaam is one of the places they were driven to. There may have been a time when trolls and manticores roamed freely across all of Khorvaire; now, Droaam is the land of monsters.</p>
    <p>So Droaam is a place where you can meet three impossible things before breakfast—and one of them may be the one serving you breakfast. While there are enclaves—such as Cazhaak Draal and the Venomous Demesne—that are largely populated by a single species, most of the great cities of Droaam are diverse communities hosting all manner of monsters. It’s important to recognize just how varied the inhabitants of Droaam can be. There are significant differences in basic biology, psychology, and intellect. Ogres, trolls, hill giants, and ettins possess great physical power but are not as intelligent as humans, and Droaam’s other citizens know to express things in ways they can understand and not antagonize them unnecessarily. Gargoyles are elementals and don’t eat or drink; if you want to make a kind gesture to a gargoyle, you don’t offer it a drink, you present it with a riddle.</p>
    <p>Here’s an overview of the most common sentient creatures in Droaam and the roles they play in society. If you’d like more information, Frontiers of Eberron: Quickstone goes into greater detail about Droaam and its inhabitants and includes playable species for Gargoyles, Harpies, Medusas, and Worgs.</p>
    <p><strong>Changelings.</strong> The changelings who leave their city of Lost often work directly for the Daughters. Most use their skills as part of Katra’s Voice, serving as entertainers, mediators, and bards; others gather information as Teraza’s Eyes. Unless they have reason not to, the changelings of Lost wear their true faces; however, they use their shape-shifting aesthetically, creating exotic or ever-changing patterns across their skin. Skindancing is a changeling art that blends physical motion with transformation, and it can be a remarkable experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Gargoyles.</strong> Since the rise of the Daughters, gargoyles have been deployed across Droaam; they are also favorite recruits of House Tharashk. Civilian gargoyles serve as messengers and couriers, while most warlords also have a unit of combat-ready gargoyles that serve as scouts and rapid response. As elementals, gargoyles don’t eat, sleep, or drink, and they can remain motionless for months or years. While gargoyles have traditionally been depicted as cruel predators, the fact is that they love the thrill of hunting. They yearn for challenge, and love riddles and puzzles almost as much as hunting prey.</p>
    <p><strong>Giants.</strong> The mountains of Droaam are home to ettins and hill giants, both of which are native to Khorvaire. Ettins are distantly related to orcs, while the hill giants of Khorvaire are a form of ogre; while they use the same stat block as the devolved hill giants of Xen’drik, they aren’t actually related. In the Barrens of the past, giants would come down from the mountains and dominate groups of goblins and kobolds. In Droaam today, they have primarily been drawn into heavy labor, as well as providing raw power to the armies of Droaam. Giants are not especially bright; as long as they are fed well (which requires a lot of food!) and celebrated for their efforts, they are generally content to serve their purpose.</p>
    <p>Vralkek is also home to a small contingent of giants from Xen’drik that found a home in this land of monsters. Most serve the fire giant Gorodan Ashlord, or at least acknowledge him as their spokesman to the Daughters of Sora Kell.</p>
    <p><strong>Gnolls.</strong> The gnolls of Droaam are described in more detail later in this section, and a playable species is presented in chapter 6. Every major city has a garrison of gnoll soldiers, who protect the interests of the Daughters. These gnolls aren’t part of Maenya’s Fist, and generally serve as peacekeepers rather than being used in punitive actions. Some warlords hire additional gnolls to serve their own personal agendas. While almost all gnolls in Droaam serve as mercenaries with the Znir Pact, there are always those whose services aren’t currently contracted. Idle gnolls often work as hunters, selling fresh game to the local markets; grist is sustaining, but there are many creatures who prefer other meat when they can get it.</p>
    <p><strong>Goblins and Kobolds.</strong> Both goblins and kobolds were once oppressed underclasses within the Barrens, dominated by almost every other species in the plains. Over time, they developed their own shared culture that’s entirely different from the cultures of either species elsewhere in Khorvaire; when someone says “goblin” in Droaam, it’s understood that they mean “goblins or kobolds.” Most goblins and kobolds feel a close kinship and look out for each other. They learned long ago to value cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever. They are patient and enduring, and tolerate endless suffering while waiting for an opportunity to present itself.</p>
    <p>Those goblins who serve the Daughters of Sora Kell lead far better lives than their ancestors in the Barrens, and they are among the most numerous inhabitants of the large cities—and the most devoted supporters of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Most are especially excited about Kethelrax the Cunning, the kobold warlord; they believe that this marks the beginning of a new age where goblins will be recognized and rewarded for their work. However, there are still goblins in the domains of some warlords—notably Turakbar’s Fist—who live miserable, short lives. While most goblins are content to focus on their work, some seek to help their oppressed kin or take petty vengeance on ogres and giants for the vast suffering inflicted on their people.</p>
    <p><strong>Harpies.</strong> The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains claim to be the children of the Fury, and they take joy in flight and song. They are wild and passionate, embracing love and hate alike with reckless abandon. Those harpies who left the mountains to “sing Katra’s song” have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. They are generally more intelligent than the standard harpy in the Monster Manual and have more control of their supernatural voices, being capable of inspiring a range of emotions. Harpies call the hour and summon workers; they also help with crowd control, serve as town criers, and entertain the people.</p>
    <p>In representing a harpy character or interacting with one, highlight their passion. Harpies love what they do; if they don’t, they won’t do it. Singing isn’t merely a magical tool; it’s a joyful act, a communion with the Fury and a work of art woven together. Whether singing weary goblins to sleep in a grist mill or acting as a courier in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But harpies hate just as strongly as they love—and there are harpies who hate the Daughters and the entire idea of Droaam.</p>
    <p><strong>Humans.</strong> Most humans living in Droaam are easterners—brigands or renegades evading the law, or merchants seeking opportunities. However, a few are natives, serving Droaam as part of the Venomous Demesne. While the demesne’s nobles are tieflings, humans are a significant part of the population, and Demesne humans can be found serving as magewrights in other cities. The humans of the Venomous Demesne have little in common with the people of the East and feel no kinship to the Five Nations.</p>
    <p><strong>Medusas.</strong> There are relatively few medusas in Droaam, but their intelligence and mystical power makes them a vital part of this growing nation. Medusa architects direct construction in the blended cities, laying the foundations of what this nation will become. Medusas who choose to serve as Voices of Katra are often called upon to resolve disputes and enforce justice, for who dares challenge the ruling of a medusa? Cazhaak Draal is also the seat of the most organized religious tradition in Droaam—the worship of the Dark Six—and most powerful priests of the Six are medusas. Compared to many denizens of the region, medusas tend to be calm and rational; however, they expect to be treated with respect and aren’t above a few harsh lessons to make a point.</p>
    <p>The medusas of Droaam are capable of receiving visual impressions through their serpent mane, and can close their primary eyes to prevent any threat of petrification. Medusa magewrights can also master a ritual—the Medusa’s Kiss—that undoes the effects of medusa petrification, allowing this power to be used in a number of useful ways (such as preserving the life of a creature about to die). Medusas can control the movements of their serpents, and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have developed a simple sign language called Serpentine that uses the movements of the serpents to convey messages. Other species can learn to understand Serpentine as a rare language, but there’s no way to speak it without a mane of living serpents.</p>
    <p><strong>Minotaurs.</strong> The minotaur clans of Droaam are spread across the plains. They are fierce barbarians and warriors who dominated goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other creatures in the days of the Barrens, and to this day, it is these clans that often lead raids into Droaam. However, this fierce aggression has prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves.</p>
    <p>The minotaurs believe that they are the chosen warriors of a being commonly known as the Horned King, and they hone their skills in battle so they may join the King after death. Each clan has their own private name for the King and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects of his followers. In most cases, the Horned King seems to be an analogue to the overlord Tol Kharash, desiring only bloodshed and conquest. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage—much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Horned King—the Dawn Gorer—encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya’s Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.</p>
    <p>Minotaurs are fierce and brave, but they generally lack patience and discipline; they are terrifying raiders, but most have trouble with large-scale tactics and operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Ogres.</strong> Ogres are more common than their giant cousins, but fill much the same role in society. Physically powerful but somewhat dimwitted, they pursue simple pleasures: food, drink, and crushing small creatures that annoy them. The warlords charm them with harpy song and fill them with grist, then set them to work lifting heavy things and smashing things that need to be smashed. They’re often recruited in local “brute squads” and serve as basic shock troopers in the armies of Droaam.</p>
    <p>Ogres fall below human standards on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma; not only do they struggle with rational thought, they’re impulsive and relatively weak-willed, and in many ways can be treated as mighty children. While physically powerful, they’re easily swayed by strong personalities and compelling stories. They are very emotional—though they can shift between emotions rapidly—and love stories and songs, even if stories need to be kept simple. It’s not uncommon for an ogre to develop a deep attachment to its favorite harpy or changeling storyteller.</p>
    <p><strong>Oni.</strong> The origins of the oni are a mystery. Some people believe oni are the offspring of hags and giants, and that some are children or grandchildren of the Daughters themselves. Other stories claim there’s a kingdom of oni in Khyber, likely a demiplane, and that the oni of the surface world are criminals banished from this wondrous realm. While rare, their intelligence and power make them valuable to the Daughters of Sora Kell. The oni Tzaryen Rrac is a trusted warlord, while other oni serve as commanders in Maenya’s Fist, inquisitors in Katra’s Voice, or administrators throughout the realm.</p>
    <p>Oni are cunning and curious. Some serve the Daughters in exchange for treasure, others for arcane lore, while some are simply content with the power they hold as agents of the hags. You could tie their broader goals to their true origin—if the oni are exiles from a hidden kingdom, they might be building power to reclaim that kingdom. If they are the children of the Daughters, they could be competing with one another to impress their parent, and generally engaging in sibling rivalry.</p>
    <p><strong>Orcs.</strong> Over countless generations of life in the Barrens, the orcs of the region developed two distinct cultures. The larger of the two are the Gaa’aram—Children of Wrath. The Gaa’aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often forced into service by more powerful creatures, the Gaa’aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa’aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa’aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they’re the reason for the name of the Orcbone fortress that guards the Gap of Graywall. Gaa’aram orcs can be found in all of the diverse cities, and they’re usually passionate supporters of both Droaam and their local warlords.</p>
    <p>In the days before Droaam, few people of the Five Nations had even heard of the smaller of the two cultures, the Gaa’ran—Children of Sacrifice. The Gaa’ran orcs are pacifists and farmers—one of the only cultures to farm in the open Barrens. They believe that violence stains the soul—that those whose souls are pure pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa’ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torture and death, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa’ran settlements to stand—with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa’ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa’ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.</p>
    <p>The Gaa’aram and Gaa’ran are both local cultures with no direct ties to other orcs of Eberron. Gaa’aram orcs are among those monstrous mercenaries House Tharashk has recruited in Droaam. The Gaa’ran have a talent for primal magic that suggests they were once tied to the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches, but they are not Gatekeepers and don’t fight aberrations; their interest lies solely in cultivation.</p>
    <p><strong>Shifters.</strong> There are a significant number of shifters among the humanoid population of Droaam. In the former Barrens, shifters were largely mixed together with the Gaa’aram orcs, much the same way that the goblins and kobolds of Droaam have formed a collective culture. These orcs call shifters taarka’va— wolf brothers. Pairings between shifter and orc can produce offspring, but the resulting half-orcs are almost always sterile.</p>
    <p>Another group of shifters are found in the Watching Woods. They call themselves Ur’haakar—First Panthers. These shifters shun civilization and take pride in their primal connection. Experts at stealth, they possess both Hunter Rangers and Living Weapon Monks. A few of the Ur’haakar have joined the Dark Pack and left the woods to serve the Daughters and Droaam, but most of the panthers prefer their isolation and consider the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack to be corrupted shifters.</p>
    <p><strong>Tieflings.</strong> The Venomous Demesne lies in the west of Droaam, hidden by powerful illusions. It was founded by tiefling refugees from the ancient Sarlonan kingdom of Ohr Kaluun, and its four ruling families possess great knowledge and vast arcane power. Tiefling wizards and warlocks can be found serving as Katra’s Voice or Teraza’s Eye. The people of the Venomous Demesne—including a significant human population—look down on both the inhabitants of Droaam and the Five Nations, but they value their alliance with the Daughters of Sora Kell and are willing to suffer some indignities for this cause.</p>
    <p><strong>Trolls.</strong> In the Barrens, trolls often established themselves as chibs. A clever troll would gather a band of Gaa’aram orcs and dominate (and occasionally eat) a pack of goblins and kobolds, ruling a tiny fiefdom with strength and fear. This arrangement still persists in places, especially around Turakbar’s Fist. Elsewhere, trolls have been drawn into the greater society of Droaam, serving in the military or performing heavy labor; those trolls who refuse to cooperate are “sent to work at the grist mills.” Given this, most trolls aren’t too disruptive to society. However, trolls expect to be treated with respect by smaller creatures—if you’re killed after you insult a troll, it’s considered an unusual form of suicide, not a fault on the part of the troll.</p>
    <p>Trolls are proud of their strength, and enjoy engaging in tests of strength, like tug of war or lifting, with other trolls or ogres. While they generally dismiss smaller creatures, a troll is impressed by anyone that performs remarkable feats of strength; they generally respond better to intimidation than to diplomacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Worgs and Lycanthropes.</strong> In the wake of the Lycanthropic Purge, many lycanthropes fled to Droaam. Most congregated in the Watching Wood under the leadership of the werewolf Zaeurl. However, there are a few independent lycanthropes scattered across the region. At the end of the Purge, the power of the curse of lycanthropy was weakened, and most of these survivors couldn’t spread the curse to others; they could only pass it to their offspring. Keen to avoid any chance of further persecution, many of these renegade lycanthropes spent their lives solely in animal form. Even today, most members of the Dark Pack are born in animal form and consider it their true form. The natural lycanthropes of Droaam have the ability to speak in beast form, as worgs do, though this gift isn’t passed on to creatures they afflict with lycanthropy.</p>
    <p>In time, Zaeurl forged an alliance between the renegade lycanthropes and the native worgs of the Watching Wood, and this bond—the Dark Pack—remains strong to this day. However, just as there are a small number of lycanthropes with no ties to the Pack, there are worg packs scattered across Droaam. Worgs would often ally with Barrens chibs, and gnolls of the Barrakas clan often form bonds to worg companions. In general, the people of Droaam are quite comfortable with the presence of large predators, and it’s polite to say ta kuur—You speak?—to a beast you’ve never met before.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the potency of the lycanthropic curse has returned. Under the rules of fifth edition, all lycanthropes can spread the curse, but the Daughters and Zaeurl both wish to avoid spreading lycanthropy—at least for the moment. The Dark Pack follows strict instructions—don’t bite unless you intend to kill. As with trolls, most town guards understand this rule; if your friend picks a fight with a werewolf, sorry, it has to kill them after biting them; that’s just a matter of public safety. Sora Katra is studying the curse of lycanthropy and may develop ways to prevent accidental contagion... or instead, she might develop a program of carefully managed infection to create a new corps of lycanthrope soldiers.</p>
    <p><strong>Others.</strong> These are the common species of Droaam, but there are many more that could appear. Mordain the Fleshweaver unleashes strange things into the world. Manifest zones can create monstrosities. And in general, the creatures of Droaam haven’t been subject to the expansion of a great nation and their subsequent extermination, unlike other regions. There may be a colony of yetis in the mountains. A lamia may rule over an ancient Dhakaani ruin. There may not be a large community of manticores, but you could easily find one living in Graywall. The Daughters of Sora Kell find a place for every creature.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Daughters of Sora Kell</h3>

    <p>The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn’t the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales—mostly terrifying ones in which things don’t end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can’t believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they’ll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.</p>
    <p>In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a “human.” It’s a foundation—a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what’s normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sora Katra, the Voice of Droaam</h4>

    <p>The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she’s a gifted shape-shifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She’s the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers’ hearts. She’s the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king—the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It’s only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra’s true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring tragedy.</p>
    <p>However, Sora Katra isn’t always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero’s wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge—which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them—and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It’s this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.</p>
    <p>Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she’s found weaving curses on her loom—plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale The Sleeping Prince, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter’s Daughter kills the giant in the King’s Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter’s Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra’s motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn’t kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter’s Daughter—did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there’s no question that Katra’s actions always bring misfortune to someone—especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.</p>
    <p>Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples’ anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want—such as the ambitions of her warlords—and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal—just as the prince in The Sleeping Prince was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter’s Daughter. It’s possible Droaam is another of her tests—but who’s being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?</p>
    <p>In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she’s dealing with—taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful Bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.</p>
    <p>Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters—she’s spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince—who Katra torments, seemingly without reason—or are they the Woodcutter’s Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an Artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character’s backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character’s family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sora Maenya, the Fist of Droaam</h4>

    <p>Sora Maenya is often depicted as a monster, said to wander the Towering Wood. She is known for her strength and her endless appetite; it’s commonly said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. Stories often depict her through her absence, as an unstoppable force that punishes arrogance or cruelty. The shepherd warns the foolish farmers not to settle in the forbidden meadow; later, he returns to find their bones picked clean and stacked near the hearth, but without their skulls. There’s no need to say who it was or to show the battle. The tale notes the missing skulls, and everyone knows that Maenya keeps the skulls of her victims, binding their souls to the bone and using them as lanterns.</p>
    <p>Maenya greatly enjoys games and challenges, and she may spare someone who shows spirit. While she doesn’t lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it’s not simply that she’s hungry, it’s that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song Edar’s Last Jig, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.</p>
    <p>Sora Maenya is the general of Droaam’s armies, the iron fist that crushes any rebellion. The core of her power is Maenya’s Fist, an elite corps of war trolls and skullcrusher ogres. Everything about the Fist is shrouded in mystery. Some say Maenya bred and trained them in a buried Dhakaani fortress; others say that Maenya herself forged the imposing plate armor that they wear. Whatever the truth, the members of the Fist are fanatically devoted to Maenya. While Droaam has yet to assemble an army combining the full force of its warlords, thus far, Maenya has shown herself to be a brilliant and unorthodox strategist, one not to be underestimated.</p>
    <p>In her natural form, Sora Maenya is an annis hag—a towering, powerful figure. She can assume smaller forms, but rarely seeks to play psychological games with her shapeshifting as Katra does. She appears in many tales as a hungry woman—tall and thin, with ragged clothing and long black hair, seeking shelter and food. While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven’t been revealed in the tales...</p>
    <p>While she’s known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn’t just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a Monk or Barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain—asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she’ll come to collect. Or perhaps it’s the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it’s she who owes the character a favor.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sora Teraza, the Dream of Droaam</h4>

    <p>Sora Teraza is the most enigmatic of the Daughters of Sora Kell. She’s known to be blind, yet she’s perfectly aware of her surroundings; it’s not that she can see, she simply knows where everything is. In some tales, it’s said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It’s also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people—books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.</p>
    <p>Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she’s not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn’t always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge—that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn’t actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn’t as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.</p>
    <p>Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there’s an Aundairian war criminal—a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for—hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart—leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information—via Dream or Sending—that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn’t mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza’s knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it’s a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Why Go to Droaam?</h3>

    <p>Droaam is a wild frontier filled with monsters. It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common species of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can’t tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It’s a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren’t just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It’s an opportunity to make bargains you couldn’t make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don’t exist elsewhere.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Patrons</h4>

    <p>The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation—even if Droaam isn’t currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don’t easily translate to low-level play—there’s no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll—it’s easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents a new species option for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you’re from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?</p>
    <p>As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important Artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Peculiar Needs</h4>

    <p>There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam—perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon’s blood and blood gin; it’s also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon’s blood, but to find out exactly who’s creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Peering Into The Past</h4>

    <p>Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they’re haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost Artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be Legendary treasures hidden in the depths.</p>
    <p>The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa’vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region’s goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Politics</h4>

    <p>Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations—especially Aundair—might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel The Queen of Stone covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Pursuit</h4>

    <p>Droaam—and Graywall in particular—is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It’s a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it’s a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It’s the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.</p>
    <p>A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Gnolls of the Znir Pact</h3>

    <p>There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. Rak Tulkesh, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they’d devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.</p>
    <p>Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren’t directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought trolls, ogres, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.</p>
    <p>Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin—then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir—a word that simply means “stone”—and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one—not chib, god, or demon—to hold dominion over them.</p>
    <p>This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.</p>
    <p>Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally—to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles—but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Znir Clans</h4>

    <p>The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units comprise gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan’s moon.</p>
    <p>The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls—though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Demon Within</h4>

    <p>The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there’s still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence—to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren’t easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of Rangers and Barbarians; the Ranger’s primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the Barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to Warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don’t serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.</p>
    <p>In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as hwyri—Gnoll for “warden”—and wield powers similar to those of Paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don’t worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren’t crusaders, they’re mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.</p>
    <p>So as a Gnoll, there is a spark of demonic influence within you. The Znir learn to control this at an early age. But how does it manifest in you? Do you suppress it completely, or do you channel it in some way—possibly reflected by your class abilities? Are you a hwyri who seeks to fight supernatural threats, or are you not concerned with such things?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Mercenary Service</h4>

    <p>While Droaam has risen around them, the Znir Pact continues as it always has. They don’t work for shelter and grist, and expect to be paid for their service. This is perfectly acceptable to the Daughters of Sora Kell, who have placed a full half of the Pact forces on extended retainer. Most large communities have a Znir garrison employed by the Daughters. These troops are present to protect the region from brigands or invaders, and to help maintain order. But they serve the Daughters, not the local chib; it’s understood that if the chib or their warlord turns against the Daughters, the local Znir will act against them. The remainder of the Pact serves other masters, and many warlords of chibs employ Znir gnolls as bodyguards, enforcers, or hunters.</p>
    <p>The Znir take their contracts seriously. If the client breaks the terms of the agreement, the contract immediately ends; but as long as terms are met, Znir will face any danger and never betray a client. They have earned this reputation over the course of centuries, and this gives them a place much like the Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith in Khorvaire; everyone knows that the word of the Znir is as unbreakable as stone.</p>
    <p>House Tharashk has begun brokering the services of Znir gnolls within the Five Nations, but the Pact leaders are cautious about this arrangement. Within Droaam, Znir customs are known and respected, and the Znir can unite against anyone who defies them. The Znir recognize that they don’t hold such power over the rulers of the Five Nations, and are concerned about serving so far from their stones. In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world. This scouting role is a reasonable path for a gnoll player character; it’s their job to travel the world beyond and learn its ways, and to make friends and allies.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Gnoll vs. Gnoll</h4>

    <p>Droaam is a small place, and the Znir serve any who will pay a fair price. This inevitably leads to conflict between Znir gnolls fighting for two opposing sides. In such situations, Znir fight one another with all their skill, but they strike to wound, not kill. A gnoll wounded by another gnoll immediately withdraws from battle, no matter how superficial the wound. While some clients take umbrage at this—“You can still fight! Get back out there!”—this is an absolute rule of all Znir contracts, and gnolls who defy this are punished by the united clans.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">What Defines the Znir?</h4>

    <p>Here are some common characteristics of gnolls—some of them biological, others cultural—that can help make a Znir character come alive.</p>
    <p><strong>Physical Appearance.</strong> A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on the clan, this can be uniform in color, or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green, and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don’t grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.</p>
    <p><strong>Bone Eaters.</strong> Gnolls possess powerful jaws, as reflected by their Bite attack. They can chew through and digest bone, and dislike letting food go to waste. When feral gnolls raid a village, they consume even the bones of their victims. Znir gnolls won’t eat their fallen foes if they’re in the company of creatures who are uncomfortable with such behavior. But they often eat a small piece of any creature they slay—even if it’s just a finger—to form a bond with the victim. The Znir believe that those you kill wait for you in the realm of death, and honoring them ensures that they won’t be hungry when you travel to that land.</p>
    <p><strong>Pack Instincts.</strong> Gnolls have very strong pack instincts. They instinctively work together in combat, and think nothing of placing themselves in harm’s way to protect their kin. Znir gnolls won’t deceive members of their pack; if there are problems, they call them out directly. If a Gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters—but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don’t show them the same respect.</p>
    <p><strong>Casual Aggression.</strong> Gnolls often seem very aggressive to other creatures. However, gnolls themselves don’t consider casual intimidation to be a hostile act; it’s just a way to establish a place in the hierarchy of the pack, largely ignored once that hierarchy is established. This manifests in how gnolls make demands rather than requests, and use active statements rather than passive queries.</p>
    <p><strong>Cunning Hunters.</strong> Gnolls are strong and aggressive by nature. But both the Znir gnolls and their uncivilized kin are cunning hunters rather than simple brutes. Gnolls work together as a pack, always searching for weaknesses in enemies and supporting injured allies. Znir gnolls won’t break their word, but they don’t hold to any idea of honorable conduct on the battlefield; they are ruthless and efficient, and see nothing wrong with ambushing or tricking a superior foe. Some gnolls have a supernatural knack for mimicry (which could be represented by the use of Minor Illusion or the Actor feat) and use this gift to draw enemies into danger.</p>
    <p><strong>Working Relationships.</strong> Droaam is a diverse region, and the Znir gnolls have always been prepared to work for any master. They don’t judge people by appearance or by their beliefs; just as they put up with demon-worshiping minotaurs in Droaam, a Znir hwyri can work alongside a templar of the Silver Flame or a warforged paladin of Dol Arrah. They may not like the people they are working with, and they may think that the beliefs of their companions are vile or foolish. But they place duty before such personal concerns, and won’t insult allies or pick fights with them.</p>
    <p><strong>Communication.</strong> The Gnoll language is unique, with a range of pitches that are difficult for humans to hear, let alone duplicate. At first, it sounds much like the vocalizations of hyenas, with whining and chattering “laughter.” It’s possible for non-gnolls to learn Gnoll, but it’s a difficult feat. When stealth isn’t necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it’s common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond.</p>
    <p>Body language and posture—usually slumped—are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises up. The Znir dislike written communication, though they do use it for contracts.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">The Heirs of Dhakaan</h2>

    <p><strong>Raat shi anaa:</strong> the story continues. In the distant past, six mighty kings rose to power. Each sought to do their duty to their people: to bring them prosperity and security, to defeat all who would threaten them. Time and again, the six kings clashed on the field of battle, but the kings were matched in cunning and their warriors were equals in courage and skill. No victory could be won, and no compromise could be found.</p>
    <p>Jhazaal Dhakaan called the six kings together, and none could resist her summons. She brought them to a field soaked with blood and strewn with blunted blades. Jhazaal Dhakaan sang the song of the dar, reminding the kings that they were all one people. She sang the song of muut, of the duty all dar share. She sang the song of atcha, of the glory awaiting the people, of the heroes of the past and of those yet to come. With her words, she wove a dream, and she gave that dream to the six kings and to all who followed them. It was with this song that the Empire of Dhakaan was born, and it is this dream that guides us still.</p>
    <p>Our empire was so grand that even the spirits grew jealous. The Lords of Madness crawled out of the shadows. They made monsters of our children and sought to break our people with terror. But no power could stand against the champions of Dhakaan. Our heroes blinded the Lord of Eyes and cut the roots of the Rotting Queen. They fought the great Corruptor and brought him down, but even as he fell, he whispered to the hero who defeated him. His foul words lingered, clinging to the champions, and they drowned out Jhazaal’s song. As the whispers spread, those who heard them forgot the ways of muut and atcha. They forgot the glorious dream. They forgot what it meant to be dar. The duur’kala and the chot’uul came together, but there was no easy answer; only time would still the poisoned words. Our greatest leaders each took one of the treasures of our people and bore them down into the depths, into ancient fortresses that neither enemy nor poisoned word could penetrate. And there we remained, waiting for the echoes of that ancient curse to die, waiting to restore the dream of the people.</p>
    <p>Now that time is upon us. We have risen from our vaults and returned to a world that has been twisted by madness. Chaat’oor—defilers—have built foul cities on our foundations. The so-called “goblins” who remain have forgotten their glory and what it means to be dar. We must unite the Keepers of Dhakaan. We must reclaim our ancient treasures and crown the Emperor Yet to Come. And under their banner, we shall cleanse this land and restore our tarnished dream.</p>
    <p>Raat shan gath’kal dor: the story stops but never ends.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Goblin History</h3>

    <p>Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It’s commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory—that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the dar—a Goblin word meaning “the people.” For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.</p>
    <p>The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur’kala bard of the age and the Artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn Ghaal’duur in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This Uul Dhakaan—Dream of Dhakaan—gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first marhu—emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.</p>
    <p>The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the duur’kala—dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance—identified the threat but couldn’t find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the Kapaa’vola—the Treacherous Whisper—had faded. These armies called themselves the Kech Dhakaan, Keepers of the Empire—a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.</p>
    <p>On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa’vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn’t even know the term Kapaa’vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn’s curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor—artificers of Dhakaan—and the duur’kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa’vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. It was in this time that the terms goblin, bugbear, and hobgoblin took root, even among the former dar themselves. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth—that the foundations they’d built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel.</p>
    <p>The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner. Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.</p>
    <p>In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal’dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal’dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued muut and atcha—their duty to their people and their personal honor—though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the chaat’oor–the non-native defilers—who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal’dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat’oor in the process. And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh’dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur’kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa’vola had faded; these Ghaal’dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan. And so, over the last two decades, the Keepers of Dhakaan have emerged from their vaults and returned to the world above.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Uul Dhakaan</h4>

    <p>To unite the Six Kings, Jhazaal Dhakaan created a dream they could share—a vision that bound them all together. However, this isn’t just a metaphor. When mortals sleep, their spirits touch Dal Quor and create temporary dreamscapes. Jhazaal Dhakaan bound the spirits of the dar together, creating a vast, permanent dreamscape within Dal Quor—a vision of the ideal empire. With the spirit of every dar tied to this place, when one of them sleeps, they dream of the empire and their place within it.</p>
    <p>The Uul Dhakaan isn’t oppressive. Each dreaming dar has their own unique dreams within the Uul, and just like normal dreams, these are a place to process recent events and experiences. But the Uul Dhakaan provides a foundation that shapes and flavors those dreams, teaching and inspiring even while allowing the dar to process their own experiences. The Uul Dhakaan also retains the memories of all those who have gone before. While dreaming in the Uul Dhakaan, a warrior could experience a battle against the daelkyr that occurred thousands of years ago, fighting alongside one of the greatest heroes of that age. A smith could forge a blade alongside a legendary daashor. These things aren’t real; both the hero and the smith are dreams, pieced together through memory. And as with any dream, the dreamer likely won’t remember most of it after they wake up. But it remains in their subconscious as a source of inspiration and instinct. The dar know what the empire could and should be. They know the role they are supposed to play, the meaning of muut and atcha. And they feel the connection to the dar around them, understanding they all share that common vision. As discussed in the next section, this reinforces the other aspects of the Dhakaani psyche, strengthens their martial discipline, and underlies their adherence to caste roles.</p>
    <p>The Uul Dhakaan is a dream, and for most dar, it’s nothing more than that. It’s not something they discuss with outsiders, nor something they give much thought to from day to day; dreaming of the empire is just a part of life. But there are a few people within each kech who deal with the Uul Dhakaan in a more concrete fashion:</p>
    <p><strong>Chot’uul.</strong> The “dream watchers” are an order of monks who monitor the Uul Dhakaan and protect it from corruption. In addition to specialized training and mental discipline, the chot’uul employ tools to retain their full consciousness and memories while dreaming, even allowing them to bring prized possessions into the dream. These Uul’kur and Kra’uul items are described in more detail in chapter 7. The chot’uul protect the Uul Dhakaan from quori manipulation, the corruption of the daelkyr, and other spiritual threats.</p>
    <p><strong>Duur’kala.</strong> A dirge singer’s training often includes time within the Uul Dhakaan. An Uul’kur allows the novice duur’kala to experience historical events within the dream or to study with the memory-shades of duur’kala masters.</p>
    <p><strong>Uul’kala.</strong> The “dream singers” are dirge singers who specialize in walking in dreams. The deep vaults of the Kech Dhakaan are spread across Khorvaire, and the uul’kala act as their ambassadors and emissaries, maintaining communication between each kech and planning strategies. This serves a similar role to the Speaking Stones of House Sivis, for a duur’kala equipped with an Uul’kur can report back to superiors in their dreams. While useful, this practice isn’t as widespread as the Speaking Stones of the Five Nations. Uul’kur are a limited resource, and even with one, it takes skill to navigate within the dream. There are kech vaults that lost their last uul’kala over the centuries in isolation, and as a result, that clan’s fate remains unknown to the present day.</p>
    <p>The Uul Dhakaan serves as a foundation for the Dhakaani</p>
    <p>psyche, reinforcing their beliefs and traditions. But it’s</p>
    <p>not an oppressive force, and for most Dhakaani, it’s simply</p>
    <p>a source of instinct and inspiration. In creating a Dhakaani</p>
    <p>character, consider whether the Uul Dhakaan holds any</p>
    <p>special importance for you.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Who Knows About the Dhakaani?</h4>

    <p>When humans first came to Khorvaire, they knew nothing of the fallen goblin empire. What does the typical citizen of the Five Nations know today? Can a Brelish soldier tell the difference between a Ghaal’dar mercenary and a Dhakaani duur’kala? For that matter, what do the Ghaal’dar hobgoblins know about the Heirs of Dhakaan?</p>
    <p>Anyone who has received the common education of the Five Nations knows that there was a goblin empire that fell before humans arrived on Khorvaire. Recalling the name “Dhakaan” requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. With a DC 15 check, a character also knows broad details—the territory controlled by the empire, the timeline of its rise and fall, the role of the subspecies, and its clashes with other cultures. A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa’vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat. Goblinoids of Darguun are more broadly familiar with their history, and would certainly know the name of the Empire of Dhakaan, know about the duur’kala and the Silent Clans, and understand the idea of muut and atcha, even if they don’t experience these concepts in the same way as the dar. Darguuls must still make an Intelligence (History) check to recall the names of specific heroes or events tied to the empire, but generally receive Advantage on such checks.</p>
    <p>So this is what people know about the fallen empire—but what about the Kech Dhakaan and its many clans? Do people know the origin and goals of the Keepers? This is more complicated, as the Kech Dhakaan have chosen to hide in plain sight. Before Darguun, goblinoid tribes and clans were scattered across the wilds of Khorvaire. When Haruuc established his nation, many unknown tribes stepped out of the shadows to take a place in his court. This was a perfect opportunity for the Kech Dhakaan and its Silent Clans. Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal’dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur’kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors. But the Ghaal’dar don’t know that these clans have a direct tie to the ancient empire, that they possess powerful Dhakaani relics and daashor artificers, or that these clans are preparing to choose a new emperor of their own. Likewise, the Ghaal’dar don’t know anything about the Uul Dhakaan, and they don’t understand the fundamental differences between the modern goblins and the ancient dar. And because the Kech Dhakaan hide their true numbers and capabilities, the Ghaal’dar don’t realize just how powerful these clans are; most of the Ghaal’dar tribes believe that the kech are small and somewhat backward, out of touch with modern life.</p>
    <p>If the Darguuls know little about the Kech Dhakaan, the people of the Five Nations know even less. When traveling abroad, the Heirs of Dhakaan generally take advantage of the broad ignorance of goblin culture, allowing people to assume that they’re Darguul mercenaries. They won’t hide their names or distinctive equipment, but it’s a rare human who recognizes Dhakaani designs. Generally, the only way someone knows details about the Kech Dhakaan is if they’ve had personal experience with them.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">What Defines the Dhakaani?</h3>

    <p>To understand the Dhakaani, one must know the factors that shape them—biological, cultural, and supernatural. Some of these factors apply to all goblinoids, while others were weakened or destroyed by the Kapaa’vola, and apply solely to the Kech Dhakaan. As with any species or culture, these are generalized traits, and any individual dar could stray radically from this foundation. But it’s a place to begin when creating a Dhakaani player character or NPC.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Biology</h4>

    <p>At a glance, the goblinoid subspecies are as different from one another as humans and halflings. The subspecies can’t interbreed and have different lifespans. But a primal connection binds the dar together, with scent, body language, and other subtle factors uniting them; at an instinctual level, they feel more comfortable around goblinoids than they do with other humanoids.</p>
    <p><strong>Born Underground.</strong> Goblinoid civilization began in the caverns of Khyber, and the Kech Dhakaan have lived in subterranean vaults for countless generations. They are comfortable in close and barren environments, and may find vast open spaces to be disorienting.</p>
    <p><strong>Living in Darkness.</strong> Tied to their subterranean origins, the dar are used to living by the dim light of luminescent fungi or with no light at all. While absolute darkness impairs their Darkvision, it’s still possible to see and operate under those conditions, and many goblin tunnels have no light whatsoever. As a result, the dar have no inherent fear of darkness. They generally prefer to be active in times of Dim Light when their night-blind enemies are disadvantaged but the goblins can see freely, and Dhakaani communities come alive as night falls.</p>
    <p><strong>Lawfully Inclined.</strong> At a primal level, the dar seek structure and hierarchy. They prefer to work in groups and to have a clear plan of action, and tend toward lawful alignments. This doesn’t mean that they feel any compulsion to follow the laws humans impose; rather, they are more inclined to work with others and to respect authority within their own communities. This basic instinct strengthens both the cultural drive of muut and the impact of the Uul Dhakaan.</p>
    <p><strong>Inherently Rational.</strong> The minds of dar are inherently pragmatic and rational. They have trouble engaging with entirely abstract concepts or things that cannot be proven. They prefer history to fiction; while the duur’kala inspire troops with stories, these are tales of things that actually happened. As a result, divine spellcasters are rare among the dar, as they struggle with the transcendental faith required to channel divine magic. While this could be considered a cultural trait, it’s tied to the underlying psyche of the dar; they take well to structure and discipline, but struggle with pure faith. The Kapaa’vola weakened this trait within the wider goblinoid population, and there are priests of the Sovereigns and Six among the Ghaal’dar hobgoblins, but even there, priests, paladins, and divine magic are less common than among humans and their kin.</p>
    <p><strong>Body Language.</strong> The pointed ears of the dar are more flexible than human ears, and are an important part of the body language of the dar. Hobgoblins have especially expressive ears, and it’s common for hobgoblin soldiers to use their ears to signal allies when silence is required, the same way a human soldier would use hand gestures. Two quick flicks of the ear is a common signal to allies to be on guard. Consider the ears of a dar in describing its mood.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Muut and Atcha</h4>

    <p>Dhakaani society revolves around the concepts of muut and atcha. Muut is typically translated as “duty,” though it can also be seen as “the honor of the empire”—something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don’t expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to “thank you” is ta muut, which simply means, “You do your duty.”</p>
    <p>By contrast, atcha refers to “personal honor” or “glory,” an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation paatcha means, “This is a chance to gain honor!”</p>
    <p>The Ghaal’dar have adopted the concepts of muut and atcha, but merely as abstract concepts. For the dar, muut and atcha are the driving poles of daily life. Every dar knows muut; they know what is expected and what they owe to the empire. They feel a deep bond to their fellow dar, and know that in pursuing muut, they serve the common good. At the same time, they yearn to attain atcha—to exceed expectations, to do deeds that will be remembered by those who follow you. The deep role of muut and atcha is shaped both by childhood training, by daily life, and further by the Uul Dhakaan. So while Dhakaani have personal desires and ambitions, muut should always come first.</p>
    <p>The Dhakaani idea of “honor in victory” is quite different from that of Dol Arrah and the people of the Five Nations. The Dhakaani prize victory and efficiency, both on and off the battlefield. Atcha comes from standing your ground against seemingly impossible odds and from displaying skill and discipline. There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire—but when possible, it’s always better to kill for the empire. Muut demands that dar honor their debts and keep their promises; but ultimately, muut only binds dar to dar, and some feel no shame in lying to the chaat’oor who have stolen their lands and pillaged their tombs.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dar United</h4>

    <p>The culture of the Kech Dhakaan is relentlessly martial. The Keepers are armies who have been keeping the dream of the empire alive for thousands of years. There is no place for indolence or waste among the Dhakaani; surviving countless generations in the deep vaults required strict discipline. The young are assigned roles based on their subspecies and their aptitudes, and progress is based on performance. Now that the Dhakaani have returned to the surface, resources are more plentiful and life is less austere. However, thousands of years of strict tradition remain in place.</p>
    <p>Within the Kech Dhakaan, all of the dar subspecies are celebrated for their strengths and what they have to offer the empire. This is reinforced both by the principle of muut and by the Uul Dhakaan. While different subspecies fill different roles in their community, it’s important to note that among the Dhakaani, all roles are respected. Among the surface-dwelling Darguuls, goblins are often oppressed and dismissed, forced into menial tasks—by contrast, the Dhakaani are grateful for the service of the golin’dar, whether they are skilled crafters or menial workers. The goblin who cleans the latrines is serving the demands of muut as fully as a formidable hobgoblin warlord. The ghaal’dar lead because they are natural leaders. The guul’dar use their strength for the greater good. These things are simply understood, and the ghaal’dar don’t have to use force to enforce their rule.</p>
    <p>Stemming from this sense of unity, dar avoid killing other dar whenever they can. The Kech Dhakaan have different views on the future course of the empire, and each kech hopes to fill the throne. But they recognize that they are few against a world, and can’t afford to carelessly spill the blood of other dar. This principle doesn’t apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the “bugbears” and “hobgoblins.” Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don’t know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don’t understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa’vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age. But compromise has never been a virtue of the Dhakaani, and what happens next will depend on the Emperor Yet to Come.</p>
    <p>While the principle of muut calls for individual sacrifice for the good of the empire, the dar generally have no great empathy for other species, and they are willing to take harsh action to secure the prosperity of their people. The Dhakaani don’t subjugate other species—but not because of compassion. Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don’t share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them. They are fine with coexistence—as long as the enemy exists over there, and as long as the dar don’t need more land.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Before Family</h4>

    <p>Family lines are of minimal importance among the Keepers. Rank must be earned, not inherited from a parent, and family names are only used within a clan. In a formal situation, the full clan name is used with no article (“Dhaaka of Kech Volaar”). Leaders often use the surname Dhakaan as a way of indicating that the empire itself is their family; thus, Tuura Dhakaan of Kech Volaar and Ruus Dhakaan of Kech Shaarat aren’t actually related, it’s a formal affectation.</p>
    <p>Depending on their purpose in the wider world, it’s common for dar to use a “traveling name” among gath’dar—a general term for non-Dhakaani, without the pejorative tone of chaat’oor. The Kech Volaar and Kech Shaarat have both revealed their presence (though while posing as Darguul clans) and their names are used freely; other clans may or may not choose to operate openly.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Fashion and Art</h4>

    <p>The dar are soldiers. Most wear common uniforms, which have diverged slightly across clans, but the core designs are similar. Dhakaani uniforms and armor are durable and functional, designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods. Officers often sport hornlike protrusions on their helmets or shoulder plates that indicate rank. Many dar also wear an armored mask that covers the lower face; for lower-ranking soldiers, the design of the mask is usually tied to the clan, while for officers, it may evoke an honored ancestor or an imposing beast.</p>
    <p>Many dar make use of tattoos or scarification. Kech symbols are a common marking, but some—notably the Kech Volaar—take this further, with an ongoing series of tattoos that reflect the bearer’s life and accomplishments.</p>
    <p>Dhakaani art, like the rest of their culture, is practical and functional. Dar aren’t fond of abstraction, and their art is primarily instructional (depicting an ideal to strive toward) or commemorative (preserving the deeds of heroes). Dar art can be realistic—faithfully representing historical figures—or symbolic—depicting Dhaakani ideals in simple and iconic ways.</p>
    <p>Dar clothing and art is generally designed to be viewed in dark subterranean tunnels, where Darkvision conveys color in shades of gray. As a result, color combinations can seem quite odd to human eyes, but this is because they aren’t chosen for their color, but for how they appear in the dark.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cuisine</h4>

    <p>The Kech Dhakaan began as armies, and further had limited resources in the deep vaults; as a result, their food focuses on practical nutrition, and waste is unacceptable. Dhakaani cuisine is simple, hearty, and very portable once prepared. Food tends to be thick and chewy, with sour and bitter flavors central to the dar palate, and strong spices sometimes used to mask undesirable tastes. On the surface, a grain known as noon is a primary source of sustenance. In the subterranean vaults, a fungus called suur fills this role. Surface-dwelling dar enjoy lizards and snakes—sources of both eggs and meat—while in the depths, blind cave fish and insects are common sources of protein.</p>
    <p>Suur and noon are usually eaten in the form of starchy balls. Other Dhakaani meals are typically boiled or steamed in flavored liquids, such as eggs boiled in broth. In addition to being used for seasoning, pickling is a crucial form of preservation. Dehydrated meats, especially chewy lizard and fish jerky, are also common staples.</p>
    <p>While sweet foods are rare within the kech, the golin’dar have a noted sweet tooth. Traveling goblins often indulge in sweets and desserts while traveling with gath’dar. However, dar are often lactose intolerant, and as a result, might avoid many gath’dar foods.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Traditions and Equipment</h4>

    <p>Dhakaani daashor are the finest weaponsmiths on Khorvaire, their skill at metallurgy outstripping even House Cannith. Their traditions blend mundane skill and transmutation to create and manipulate remarkable alloys, including adamantine, mithral, and byeshk, and Dhakaani champions often wield weapons forged from such material. Dhakaani equipment is designed for durability and efficiency, rarely gaudy or bejeweled. Likewise, armor is tough and flexible—often with the properties of Mithral or Adamantine Armor—but not dramatic in style.</p>
    <p>Dhakaani magic items are either created by the daashor (who specialize in armor and weapons) or by gifted duur’kala. Dhakaani magic rarely focuses on evocation effects, and they have no tradition of elemental binding. While the Dhakaani lack the wide-scale production capacity of House Cannith, they’ve had thousands of years to build supplies. Elite units are often equipped with Uncommon magic items, such as Adamantine Armor, Cloaks of Protection, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and Vola’khesh (described in chapter 7). Shaarat’khesh assassins may use Hats of Disguise, Bags of Holding, or Cloaks of Elvenkind—though not by that name!—and sometimes more powerful weapons, such as Daggers of Venom or Keeper’s Fangs (also in chapter 7). So while the Dhakaani dar are relatively few in number compared to the people of the Five Nations, they’re not only disciplined and highly skilled, but also well equipped.</p>
    <p>When the empire was at its height, the daashor and duur’kala could create grand Artifacts and Eldritch Machines, such as Ghaal’duur and the Grieving Tree presented in chapter 7. The creation of such Artifacts was never trivial, and relied on remarkable talents, knowledge lost during the daelkyr incursion, and the use of rare substances and planar conjunctions. As such, while it’s possible for the Dhakaani to create new Artifacts, they are primarily concerned with recovering and reclaiming ancient treasures forged in the past. The Kech Dhakaan are deeply concerned about how many of their treasures have been claimed by chaat’oor, and react with anger toward other species carrying Dhakaani relics.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Dhakaan</h3>

    <p>As the Kapaa’vola spread and the Empire of Dhakaan quickly unraveled, many of its greatest leaders sealed their followers in deep vaults. Each of these units took responsibility for preserving one of the pillars of the empire. Together, they called themselves the Kech Dhakaan—the Keepers of the Empire. The name of each individual clan was given based on their chosen ideal; thus the Kech Volaar are Keepers of the Word, and the Kech Shaarat are Keepers of the Sword. Uul’kala helped to coordinate this effort and to maintain communication between the isolated vaults over time, but there are kech vaults that never had uul’kala, and others who lost their uul’kala over time.</p>
    <p>Chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War includes general information about the Heirs of Dhakaan, campaign hooks, and possible NPCs. This section expands on the clans named in that chapter, including descriptions of some Keeper clans that are known or active. This isn’t intended to be a complete list, and DMs should feel free to add additional kech—whether they have been in communication with the others or have been in isolation—or to remove kech from this list if they don’t fit the story of a campaign.</p>
    <p>Of these clans, both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar have made their presence known in Darguun. But while the Darguuls have heard of these clans, they don’t fully understand their origins. The other clans are currently obscure and mysterious, though dramatic action could quickly bring them fame—or infamy.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Draal: &quot;Keepers of the City&quot;</h4>

    <p>While the Dhakaani are renowned for their weaponcraft, it may be surpassed by their skill with fortifications and civic engineering. Many of the greatest cities of the Five Nations are built on Dhakaani foundations, and ruins of other Dhakaani fortresses still linger after many thousands of years. These techniques are the treasure guarded by the Kech Draal, and Draal daashor specialize in transmutation effects and the shaping of earth and stone. Every kech has its architects, just as the Draal have their soldiers and their duur’kala—but stonework and mining are the pride of the Kech Draal.</p>
    <p>The Kech Draal have little interest in filling the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come. While they look forward to building the next empire, they have no interest in competing with the other Keepers; they seek only the realization of the dream. They have not yet made their presence felt in the world, and it is up to the DM where their deep vault lies. It’s possible that they are beneath Wroat or Korth, secretly dwelling below the deepest foundations of a modern capital.</p>
    <p>The golin’dar play a more central role in the Kech Draal than in many clans. While the clan is formally led by the dirge singer Kuula Dhakaan and the warlord Druun Dhakaan, the ghaal’dar consult with a golin’dar council on all major decisions. The golin’dar Taala is the senior voice on this council, respected for her wisdom and skill.</p>
    <p>The neutrality of the Kech Draal can make them a good choice for a Dhakaani character, as they can find a welcome with any of the Keepers. A Draal character might be gathering information about the world, seeking lost treasure, or even just eager to survey the styles of architecture that have developed over the past millennia.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Ghaalrac: &quot;Clan of Heroes&quot;</h4>

    <p>When the kech sages identified the threat posed by the Kapaa’vola, some chose retreat—hiding in the deep vaults and waiting for the curse to pass. One of their leaders, Khaas Dhakaan, had no interest in hiding. Gathering the greatest heroes of the age—Dhakaani champions, Khesh’dar assassins, Gatekeeper orcs—Khaas led his army into the depths of Khyber, and into the demiplane that served as the prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Khaas swore to end the Treacherous Whisper and to recover Artifacts stolen by Dyrrn and its minions—Artifacts that Khaas believed could restore the splintering empire.</p>
    <p>Khaas and his champions were never heard from again, neither in the waking world nor in the Uul Dhakaan, and it was assumed that they were lost. In truth, they were trapped within Dyrrn’s demiplane, fighting an endless struggle against the minions of the daelkyr. Time moves strangely in Dyrrn’s realm, and by the reckoning of the Ghaalrac, it has been less than three centuries since they set out on their mission. Trapped in a realm of madness, the Ghaalrac have blended Dhakaani and Gatekeeper techniques with the symbionts of the daelkyr, with results that others might find horrifying. They have crafted powerful living weapons and Artifacts, along with magebred champions with unnatural powers—armored bugbears with the regenerative abilities of trolls, goblin assassins with the ability to slip through space. They have found ways to bind aberrations to their will, and have forced beholders and grells to serve them.</p>
    <p>The descendants of the Gatekeeper orcs that ventured into Khyber with the Kech Ghaalrac remain to this day, having found their own place in the clan’s caste system as specialists in druidic magic. However, the traditions carried by these once Gatekeepers vary greatly from their surface counterparts, in part because they’ve been cut off from the natural world. While still driven by the goal of fighting aberrations, after hundreds of years in an alien land, the orcs of the Kech Ghaalrac would seem similarly alien to other Gatekeepers.</p>
    <p>Now, after centuries of struggle in Khyber, the Kech Ghaalrac have returned. The current leader—who also uses the name Khaas—possesses what the Ghaalrac call Ur’taash, the “First Crown.” It’s said that this was the final creation of Jhazaal Dhakaan, forged to unite the empire; it protects his mind, allows him to communicate with Ghaalrac squads across great distances, and possesses powerful coercive abilities. Khaas claims to have torn this crown from Dyrrn’s grip as he dealt a mortal blow to the Corruptor. He believes that it is the Ghaalrac who broke the power of the Treacherous Whisper, and that only they can restore the Empire of Dhakaan.</p>
    <p>Khaas and the other leaders of the Kech Ghaalrac carry the names of heroes of ancient Dhakaan: Torrm of the Gatekeepers, the master assassin known only as Khesh, the mighty guul’dar Korrga. The original heroes are long dead, but these dar claim to be their descendants and carry their ancient weapons. They possess tremendous power, and they intend to use it. But there are many questions about the Kech Ghaalrac. Are they truly what they claim to be, or have they been corrupted by Dyrrn and turned into tools of the daelkyr, whether they realize it or not? They aren’t part of the Uul Dhakaan as experienced by the other Keepers, but they have their own version of the dream that sustained them through the long war, and believe that it is the other clans who have lost sight of the dream. The other Keepers will know nothing of the Kech Ghaalrac until the Clan of Heroes reveals itself; will they support Khaas Dhakaan of their own volition, or be compelled by the power of Ur’taash? Or will the Heirs of Dhakaan oppose these transformed heroes?</p>
    <p>The Kech Ghaalrac can appear anywhere that suits the needs of the campaign. When they appear, it should be dramatic. One option is for them to seize the Gathering Stone, House Deneith’s fortress in Darguun; this strikes a dramatic blow against chaat’oor and gives the Ghaalrac an opportunity to bend Darguuls to their will. Khaas Dhakaan believes that dar and Darguul alike are all flawed—but that all can be redeemed by the power of Ur’taash.</p>
    <p>The Kech Ghaalrac is an unlikely origin for a player character; their story works best when people don’t know if they have been corrupted or are righteous, despite their unnatural tools and techniques. However, a Dhakaani character from another kech could be determined to uncover the truth about the Kech Ghaalrac. Or a character could be the distant descendant of one of the Ghaalrac heroes, seeking to learn the final fate of their ancestor and to recover a prized relic from the Ghaalrac champion who carries it.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Hashraac: &quot;Keepers of Thunder&quot;</h4>

    <p>Siege warfare and combat engineering are the specialties of the Kech Hashraac. The Dhakaani don’t employ Siege Staffs or evokers, and the Hashraac has spent generations developing new weapons to dominate the battlefield. If the DM wishes to add the conventional firearms and cannons presented in the Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide to a campaign, the Kech Hashraac could have developed these weapons during their long isolation. Alternatively, the Hashraac could specialize in the enhanced artillery described in chapter 1, alchemical explosives, or an entirely new form of weapon.</p>
    <p>The Kech Hashraac have yet to reveal their presence to the world at large. While few in number, the force they command could be vital in any conflict that lies ahead. Will they support another kech claiming the imperial throne, or will they pursue it themselves? The warlord Duul Hashraac leads the clan; he is noteworthy both for being a daashor as opposed to a common warrior, and for using his clan name instead of “Dhakaan” as his sobriquet. Duul is proud of what his people have achieved; whether he seeks the throne or serves as kingmaker, he believes the Kech Hashraac hold the keys to Dhakaani victory.</p>
    <p>The Kech Hashraac are a logical choice for a Dhakaani Artillerist Artificer; the Artificer’s magic can be tied to the tools the DM chooses to provide to these Keepers. A Hashraac player character could be dispatched to study the battle magic of the Five Nations, to seek out rare components needed for new weapons, or to investigate the Mournland and the theory that the Mourning was caused by battle magic. Alternatively, a Hashraac Artificer could have left the clan to pursue their own unorthodox weapons research, hoping to return in triumph once they have perfected their techniques.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Nasaar: &quot;Keepers of Night&quot;</h4>

    <p>Long ago, interaction with the Aereni line of Vol led to the dirge singer Iraala becoming the first dar vampire. She shared this gift with her lover, the warlord Muurat. In the centuries that passed, the two were placed in charge of the covert operations of the empire. Spying and assassination remained the domain of the Khesh’dar, but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first recognized the threat of the Kapaa’vola, and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.</p>
    <p>Over their long seclusion, the Kech Nasaar have continued to study unconventional paths of warfare. Nasaar duur’kala often train in the techniques of the bardic College of Whispers (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), while elite soldiers of the Kech Nasaar might be Gloom Stalker Rangers (also from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything). Under the leadership of Iraala and Muurat, the Nasaar have also explored the arts of necromancy, though it’s up to the DM to decide just how far they’ve continued down this path. Do they have squads of vampire commandos? Have they developed entirely new forms of undead? Given their penchant for psychological warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by raising the bones of soldiers who died in the Last War, making it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them to seize control of undead raised by other necromancers—a technique that could cause untold chaos in Karrnath.</p>
    <p>Iraala and Muurat continue to lead the clan, giving a direct tie to the ancient empire. The edict of a long-dead emperor asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown; while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are severed from the Uul Dhakaan and cannot draw on the wisdom of the past or see Jhazaal’s dream. The Nasaar could have fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest devotees of the concepts of muut and atcha, placing the needs of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to ensure the Dhakaani Empire follows the proper course.</p>
    <p>A player character from the Kech Nasaar could follow unusual paths. A Nasaar dar might be gathering information for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities of the other Keepers, especially the Kech Ghaalrac and Kech Shaarat. Iraala may have hidden Artifacts across Khorvaire before the fall; a Nasaar character could seek to recover these in her service, or could have gone rogue to pursue one of these treasures.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Ruuska: &quot;Keepers of the Tiger&quot;</h4>

    <p>Beasts served many important roles in the Empire of Dhakaan. The Ruuska dar fill much the same role that House Vadalis does for the Five Nations: tending and training the many beasts of the empire, while always searching for—or creating—new beasts to fill a need. Ruuska is the Goblin word for “tiger,” and tigers and dire tigers are often used as cavalry in the vanguard of Dhakaani armies. But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.</p>
    <p>Just as there are soldiers in every kech, there are tenders in every vault who maintain the beasts of that vault. However, the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them, producing the finest Beast Master Rangers, and keeping the widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska also work with magebreeding and may have produced entirely new beasts or monstrosities previously unknown on the surface. While the Ruuska don’t have a spiritual bond to the natural world, they might have developed a form of Druid—a Moon Druid serving as a specialist in assuming animal forms and controlling beasts. The Ruuska have also experimented with lycanthropy. It’s up to the DM to decide if they were able to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately came to nothing, or if lycanthropy has spread throughout the Ruuska—a secret they are concealing from the other clans.</p>
    <p>The Kech Ruuska are led by the Beast Master warlord Lhaar Dhakaan and the duur’kala Oruul. The Kech Shaarat are putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.</p>
    <p>The Kech Ruuska are a good option for a Dhakaani Ranger. The clan can also be an interesting way to add new or exotic beasts or monstrosities into the world, and could be an intriguing foil for a storyline involving House Vadalis.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Shaartat: &quot;Keepers of the Sword&quot;</h4>

    <p>The Kech Shaarat are the largest of the Keeper clans. Founded by the Warlord of the South in the final days of the empire, the Shaarat possess an Artifact known as Skai Shaarat—the Great Blade—a sword handed down from warlord to warlord since the days of the Six Kings. While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept Artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths—though the Dhakaani don’t generally employ constructs, these Artificers have created innovative steel defenders. On the other hand, the Kech Shaarat have not emphasized the role of the duur’kala as much as other clans, and have a weaker bardic tradition.</p>
    <p>The Kech Shaarat have emerged into the open and are the most active of the Dhakaani tribes. The warlord Ruus Dhakaan (no relation to the Kech Ruuska, though his name does mean “Tiger”) has reclaimed several ancient Dhakaani fortresses in the Seawall Mountains, and is working to refortify these ruins. In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan—the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire—which has expanded their resources. They are actively pressuring the Kech Ruuska to submit to an alliance acknowledging Ruus as the Emperor Yet to Come, and Shaarat warriors have a bitter rivalry with the Kech Volaar.</p>
    <p>Ruus has sent representatives to Rhukaan Draal and pledged to support Lhesh Haruuc, but this is a ruse designed to bide time and to take the measure of an enemy. Ruus hasn’t revealed the true nature of his people or the full scale of his forces to the Ghaal’dar, and most Darguuls believe the Kech Shaarat are a Ghaal’dar clan with strange traditions. House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat’oor.</p>
    <p>Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned Skai Shaarat with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he’s determined to claim the imperial throne, he’s also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won’t butcher his own kind. However, he’s ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat’oor, and doubts whether the modern “goblins” can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he’s considering whether it’s simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.</p>
    <p>The Kech Shaarat are the most aggressive of the clans, and this is an interesting option for an entire party of dar adventurers. A lone Shaarat dar could be an exile from the clan or a spy evaluating the strengths and fighting styles of the chaat’oor. One option is for a Shaarat player character to have challenged Ruus and been defeated; now they seek an ancient Artifact that would allow them to face Ruus again and claim leadership over the clan.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Uul: &quot;Keepers of the Dream&quot;</h4>

    <p>The Kech Uul are a small clan. Their vault is a fortified monastery hidden deep in Khyber. This is the seat of the chot’uul, the monks who watch over the Uul Dhakaan and protect the dreams of the empire. This clan also has the largest number of uul’kala bards, and knows the most about how to produce Uul’kur and dreambound objects.</p>
    <p>The Kech Uul have yet to return to the surface of Khorvaire. Its people spend much of their time within the Uul Dhakaan itself, using drugs and meditation to enter the dream even while waking. The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting the dream from outside influences, but they’re also experts in navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dream-vestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable guide. Likewise, the uul’kala of the Dream Keepers are the backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the uul’kala maintain message stations at various points within the dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.</p>
    <p>There are several ways that the Kech Uul could fit into a campaign. They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they’re not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal’s dream from outside influences, but it’s possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they’re actually long dead, and the chot’uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.</p>
    <p>The name of the Kech Uul’s current leader is unknown outside the clan. Uul dar often wear masks or veils; they do not seek atcha, and desire only to help others achieve Jhazaal’s dream.</p>
    <p>A player character tied to the Uul dar could be an uul’kala, a Bard (likely of the College of Glamour) pursuing a dream-vision or searching for dream-related Artifacts. An exotic possibility is that the character believes it’s possible to bring other species into the Uul Dhakaan, allowing for a peaceful union; if this is the case, is this goal supported by the clan elders, or is the character an eccentric renegade? Alternatively, any dar character could have a mentor from the Uul dar, who visits them in their dreams offering guidance and inspiration.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Kech Volaar: &quot;Keepers of the Word&quot;</h4>

    <p>The Kech Volaar believe that knowledge is power. Their deep vault holds scrolls and tablets recording thousands of years of imperial history. While they have strong warriors and a proud martial tradition, the Volaar value the song over the blade and have the strongest duur’kala of any clan.</p>
    <p>While the Volaar weaponsmiths aren’t a match for those of the Kech Shaarat, the clan leaders recognize the value of arcane magic over pure mundane might. The Volaar have long worked to push the limits of duur’kala magic, and to master the techniques that created wonders such as the Uul Dhakaan and the greatest Artifacts of the old empire. The Volaar have experimented with warlocks—working with supernatural patrons under carefully controlled conditions—and sought to cultivate sorcerers when they have appeared among the dar populace. Since their return to the surface, the Kech Volaar are working both to recover the greatest Artifacts and treasures of the empire, and to study the arcane techniques of the modern gath’dar. Where the Kech Shaarat believe that Dhakaani might can sweep aside any enemy, the Volaar recognize the arcane power wielded by the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and are doing everything they can to study and master this unfamiliar science.</p>
    <p>Perhaps because of this, the Kech Volaar are also the most conciliatory of the Keeper clans. They are the most willing to interact with the gath’dar, both because they recognize the need to understand these possible enemies, and in the hopes that some form of coexistence may be possible. Like the Kech Uul, Volaar leader Tuura Dhakaan wonders if the Uul Dhakaan can expand to incorporate other creatures—if the empire can unite gath’dar as it does the dar.</p>
    <p>Despite these hopes, the Kech Volaar are devoted to the dar above all else. They are the Keepers of History, and they know the sacrifices their ancestors had to make and the bitter wars against the chaat’oor and the taarn (elves). They are wise and willing to seek all paths to prosperity, but will never surrender the dream of the eternal empire.</p>
    <p>Tuura Dhakaan has revealed herself to the world, and has sent representatives to the court of Lhesh Haruuc. Like the Kech Shaarat, the Volaar have concealed their true history and power. Volaar duur’kala often travel among the Ghaal’dar sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of muut and atcha; this ties to Tuura’s hopes that the “goblins” can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful Artifacts and building allies.</p>
    <p>The Kech Volaar are one of the most active Dhakaani clans. Adventurers could encounter Volaar reclaimers across Khorvaire as they search for Dhakaani relics. A Volaar Wizard or Artificer could be struggling to master the techniques of the gath’dar, while a duur’kala could be an envoy sent to recover an ancient treasure or to seek allies among the outsiders.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Khesh&apos;dar</h4>

    <p>Under Dhakaani tradition, the golin’dar—goblins—are traditionally laborers and artisans. While the guul’dar and ghaal’dar train for war, the golin’dar maintain the hearth. But there is a force that stands outside this tradition, lurking in the shadows of the Dhakaani Empire. These are the Khesh’dar—the Silent Folk—golin’dar who use their speed and cunning as spies, scouts, and assassins.</p>
    <p>While the Khesh’dar are part of the Uul Dhakaan, they have always remained separate from its traditions. They have always served the emperor and their warlords, but they do so in their own time. Their refuges have always been hidden, even before the Kapaa’vola. The ascetic Khesh’dar aren’t compelled by money or power; they choose when to offer aid, and set a fair price on their services. The Khesh’dar take no sides in disputes between clans, and they do not seek to rule; in the present day they serve both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar. However, they don’t accept missions that they see as threatening the empire itself; as a result, they rarely accept a charge to kill a warlord or a duur’kala.</p>
    <p>Because of this long tradition of secrecy, even the warlords of the Kech Dhakaan don’t know where the vaults of the Khesh’dar are located, or just how many of the Silent Folk are out there. Goblins are spread throughout Khorvaire and most of the great cities of the Five Nations have significant goblin populations, and this provides an easy opportunity for the Khesh’dar to move freely throughout the modern world without drawing attention. The Khesh’dar have been active throughout the last century, spying on the chaat’oor and building up resources and safe houses across the Five Nations. They’ve recruited many eyes among the modern city goblins and the goblins of Darguun, though these contacts rarely understand exactly who they are dealing with. The Khesh’dar likewise have spies and agents among the golin’dar of every Keeper clan, ensuring that there are few secrets hidden from the Silent Folk.</p>
    <p>The Khesh’dar are split into two primary traditions. The Taarka’khesh (“Silent Wolves”) are swift scouts, experts in wilderness reconnaissance and targeted strikes. The Taarka’khesh typically rely on worg cavalry; many develop an unusual primal bond with their worg companions, and the golin’dar view the worgs as partners, not beasts. Though worgs don’t have an innate tie to the Uul Dhakaan, the Beast Master Rangers of the Taarka’khesh can summon their worg companions to them while dreaming.</p>
    <p>The second Khesh’dar tradition is that of the Shaarat’khesh (“Silent Blades”), spies and assassins trained to operate within cities. Both usually operate covertly, disguised to blend in with the local goblin population. However, each order has a distinctive half-mask that is worn over the lower face during formal interactions.</p>
    <p>It’s up to the DM to decide just how widespread the Khesh’dar are. They may have a single deep vault and only a few hundred operatives, or it could be that they are the largest of the Dhakaani clans, with outposts hidden across Khorvaire. They may have been building networks for thousands of years, simply waiting for the Keepers to rise before putting these resources to use. But are they truly content to serve any emperor? Or do the Khesh’dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they’re tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?</p>
    <p>The Khesh’dar could serve as an espionage agency patron for a group of golin’dar adventurers. More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh’dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It’s not unusual for the Khesh’dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath’dar. It would be unusual for one of the Khesh’dar to explain their traditions to an outsider, but it’s not impossible that a Khesh’dar could form a bond with a gath’dar comrade over the course of their adventures.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani NPCs</h4>

    <p>Members of the Kech Dhakaan can be found across the world, seeking information, relics, and pursuing the goals of their people. They can be deadly foes—or unexpected allies against a common foe. While most of the characters on the Dhakaani NPCs table aren’t spies, they won’t volunteer information about their people or background unless they come to know and trust someone; generally, they allow others to believe that they’re from an obscure Darguun clan.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Emperor Yet to Come</h3>

    <p>For the Kech Dhakaan emerging from their vaults, the modern world is a waking nightmare. Modern goblinoids are hollow mockeries of the true dar. Foul chaat’oor hold the lands of the empire and pillage the treasures of the People. But the dar still have their dream. They know what the world should be, and know that together, somehow, they can defy the chaat’oor and restore the eternal empire. However, a long path lies ahead. The dar are badly outnumbered, and can’t take on all of the Five Nations in open combat. They don’t yet understand the enemy or know what they’re capable of. The Kech Volaar, in particular, realize the power of the wide magic of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and recognize they need to know more. There’s also the question of whether there’s any hope for the modern goblinoids. Can they be instilled with Dhakaani values? Or are they no better than chaat’oor?</p>
    <p>Only a new emperor can make this decision. But the last emperor was lost to the Kapaa’vola before the Kech Dhakaan descended into the depths, and no single kech has the power to create a new emperor. The duur’kala speak of the Emperor Yet To Come, with the belief that once all the Keepers rise, a single emperor will somehow win universal acclaim, uniting them all against the chaat’oor. But whether they be lhesh, duur’kala, or daashor, it’s unclear what will bring this to pass. The Kech Uul believe that when a single dar has the support of the majority, the Uul Dhakaan will reveal them—that the emperor will be proclaimed and crowned within the universal dream. But even if true, what will trigger this?</p>
    <p>The Kech Shaarat believe that power will determine the emperor. They have already absorbed the Kech Nozhii and are pressuring the Kech Ruuska, using a combination of force and fear to convince the smaller clans that the path to victory lies through uniting under a single clan. The Kech Shaarat would prefer not to kill other dar, but Ruus Dhakaan is willing to take steps to prove his power and right to lead, and Shaarat and Volaar agents have clashed in the field.</p>
    <p>Tuura Dhakaan of the Kech Volaar is following a different path as she pursues the crown. She seeks to recover lost Artifacts, reminding the dar of their glory while also amassing powerful tools. There are a few she is especially keen to find: Ur’taash, the First Crown; Guulen, the Rod of Kings; and Ghaal’duur, the horn of Jhazaal Dhakaan. Ur’taash is currently in the possession of Kech Ghaalrac, though its authenticity is in question. The whereabouts of Guulen and Ghaal’duur remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.</p>
    <p>Other Keepers may devise their own paths to winning allies or the throne, and there may be Keeper clans that have yet to be revealed. For now, the Kech Dhakaan are focused on gathering information and competing among themselves. Once they unite behind a single leader, they’ll have to decide how to deal with the Darguuls, the dragonmarked houses, and the Five Nations.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Playing Dhakaani Characters</h3>

    <p>There are a few factors to consider when creating a dar character. This section examines questions about the story—What’s your clan? What’s your background? In addition, chapter 6 presents three new species for Dhakaani player characters, along with two new class archetypes associated with the Dhakaani: the Forge Adept Artificer specialist, and the bardic College of the Dirge Singer.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Starting at 1st Level</h4>

    <p>The Dhakaani are among the most effective and elite forces on Khorvaire. They possess excellent training and techniques, exceptional discipline, and masterful equipment. If you’re in a campaign where characters are starting at a higher level, this isn’t an issue. But what if you’re starting at level 1? Dhakaani fighters are often Battle Master or Samurai Fighters (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) in Adamantine Armor, but you don’t gain your archetype until you’ve been adventuring outside your kech for several levels. Here are four ideas of how to explain the inconsistency:</p>
    <p><strong>Disorientation.</strong> You don’t have your traditional equipment, and it takes you a little time to get used to working with this inferior gear. You’re not used to working with chaat’oor; they don’t respond to your obvious cues, and their behavior constantly confuses you. The wide sky above is extremely disorienting, as you’ve spent much of your life underground. And worst of all is the smell. It’s going to take you a few adventures to get your groove back.</p>
    <p><strong>Injury.</strong> You’ve suffered a significant physical or psychological injury and it’s going to take you a while to recover. Frankly, after everything you’ve been through, it’s impressive that you’re even capable of functioning as well as you do. Is it a mundane injury, or something more exotic? Maybe you were possessed by a quori for a few years and you’re still reclaiming your identity. Or perhaps you were struck by shards of an exploding dragonshard; once you’re fully recovered, might those same slivers explain some of your unusual class abilities?</p>
    <p><strong>Working Undercover.</strong> Most clans don’t want the world to know their full history and capabilities. You would rather be mistaken for a Darguul or city goblin, and are keeping a low profile. You don’t have Adamantine Armor because it would raise questions, and you intentionally conceal your full capabilities until you trust your fellow adventurers enough to reveal your true talents.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Growth.</strong> All of your training up to this point has set you on this path; your past life experience readied you for the new skills you’re learning today. You underwent endless training while in your kech, but the pieces didn’t click into place until you spent time fighting in the field. One month of adventuring didn’t trump a decade of intense training, but it helped to trigger it.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, this is all about creating a story to carry you through your first few adventures. It doesn’t have to be a flawless explanation, just use your imagination and keep adventuring; soon, you’ll reach level 3!</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan and Purpose</h4>

    <p>The Dhakaani dar went into hiding thousands of years ago to avoid the Kapaa’vola. They have only recently emerged from those deep vaults and reclaimed fortresses on the surface. As a Dhakaani character, you were surely born in one of the deep vaults and indoctrinated into the traditions of your clan. Consider the following questions about your character’s origins:</p>
    <p>Which clan are you tied to? Are you one of the Kech Volaar, or are you a Hermit from the Kech Uul? Consider the list of clans from the previous section and see which works best for the story you want to tell.</p>
    <p>What was your role within your clan? The Dhakaani are armies, working with limited resources and absolute focus. Everyone had a function to perform, likely reflected by your background and your class. What training did you receive, and what was the purpose of that training? Were you a Soldier? Were you being prepared for a military specialty (possibly reflected by your choice of archetype)? If you’re a Bard, were you trained to inspire troops on the battlefield or were you primarily a diplomatic envoy? You wouldn’t have been pushed into a role unless you showed an aptitude for it—but did you like the role you were given, or was it a path you had to follow?</p>
    <p>Why have you left your clan? Despite the demands of muut and the shaping influence of the Uul Dhakaan, every dar is a unique individual with their own passions and drives. Ultimately, what do you most care about? Do you believe in the dream of the Dhakaani Empire? Do you want to become the next emperor, or do you simply want to help your people thrive? Have you rejected the bond of muut and turned your back on the empire? Or are you seeking atcha and chasing a personal story—a quest for vengeance against the defiling chaat’oor, or completing the ancient vow of an ancestor? The Dhakaani Departures table suggests some reasons a dar might leave their clan.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Background</h4>

    <p>Your clan and character motivations often suggest a logical choice for your background. However, your background can also be used to reflect your current mission as opposed to your basic training. If you’re operating undercover, you might have been taught the skills of a Charlatan and set up with a solid false identity, even if you’re a plainspoken soldier at heart. As a Shaarat’khesh Monk, the Wayfarer background can reflect your training and familiarity with cities, even though you didn’t grow up on the streets. As one of the Kech Uul, the Hermit background could represent your long isolation in Jhazaal’s dream—and you could have had a revelation in the dream, whether it concerns the future of the empire or something of even greater import.</p>
    <p>Chapter 6 includes two variant background features for use with Dhakaani characters of any background. In addition, the Dhakaani Trinkets table below suggests simple items that your character might carry from their past; your DM might let you select one of these as your trinket, or to substitute it for another small item from your background equipment. What’s its story? Why do you carry it today?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Class</h4>

    <p>Some classes and archetypes are common among Dhakaani dar, while others aren’t as likely. Here are some suggestions of interesting characters you might play for each class.</p>
    <p><strong>Artificer.</strong> The Kech Dhakaan call their Artificers daashor. The talent of artifice is rare, and some of the greatest secrets of the past were lost to the Kapaa’vola. Dhakaani Artificers typically focus on the creation of arms and armor, taking the Forge Adept archetype, provided in chapter 6, or the Battle Smith archetype. Artillerist Artificers are generally only found in the Kech Hashraac. The Kech Volaar are actively seeking to unlock the arcane traditions of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and a Volaar Artificer could follow any archetype with the idea that you are blazing new trails through your work. While the most legendary daashor were male ghaal’dar, there are no gender or species restrictions for this role, and golin’dar often show a talent for artifice.</p>
    <p><strong>Barbarian.</strong> It’s unusual for ghaal’dar to follow the path of the Barbarian, and unheard of for golin’dar. However, the guul’dar—bugbears—are taught that their strength is the strength of the empire, and guul’dar warriors typically serve as the terrifying vanguard of a Dhakaani army. This path can be represented by the Barbarian, but with an important story difference—guul’dar barbarians aren’t savages, and they don’t surrender to unthinking rage. Instead, guul’dar “rage” is a cultivated surge of adrenaline and combat awareness, not unlike the Fighting Spirit of the Samurai Fighter (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything). The Path of the Wild Heart is the common choice for guul’dar Barbarians; the choice of animal when raging doesn’t reflect a primal spirit, but rather specialized combat training. If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Nature Speaker feature with the Retaliation of the Berserker Barbarian, as it’s difficult to explain how Commune with Nature is tied to your military training.</p>
    <p><strong>Bard.</strong> Bards play a central role in Dhakaani culture, serving as spiritual leaders and taking the role that priests fill in many other cultures. However, Dhakaani Bards inspire and guide the people using tales of the past and the dream of the future, as opposed to priests seeking the favor of divine forces. Bards are also found as diplomats, civic leaders, and healers, and are the primary spellcasters in Dhakaani society. The most common Bards are the duur’kala (dirge singers); as a duur’kala, you’ll likely want to follow the College of the Dirge Singer included in chapter 6, or perhaps the College of Lore. The duur’kala of the Kech Nasaar may choose the College of Whispers (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), while the uul’kala dream singers may follow the College of Glamour. Most clans have a strongly ingrained tradition that only female ghaal’dar can serve as duur’kala. However, player characters are exceptional, and it’s always possible to defy this tradition.</p>
    <p><strong>Fighter.</strong> The Dhakaani are a martial culture, and this is their greatest strength. Dhakaani combat techniques have been honed over thousands of years, blended with the natural instincts and exceptional discipline of the Dhakaani soldier. Both the Champion and Battle Master archetypes are appropriate for all Dhakaani fighters. The Samurai archetype (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) is primarily found with the Kech Shaarat, and is a ghaal’dar variation of the guul’dar Barbarian technique. Cavaliers (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) are tied to the tiger cavalry, and are especially common in the Kech Ruuska. Within most clans, fighter training is reserved for male ghaal’dar. However, player characters can certainly challenge this stereotype.</p>
    <p><strong>Monk.</strong> Monks are rare among the Kech Dhakaan, but not unknown. The most widespread monastic tradition is the shaarat’dor (literally, “No Sword”) technique of the Khesh’dar. Practitioners can focus on the physical art as a Warrior of the Open Hand, or they can blend this with the Shaarat’khesh arts of stealth by choosing to be a Warrior of Shadow. The Khesh’dar are exclusively golin’dar, but an exceptional character of another species might be taken in by the Silent Folk. The other established monastic tradition is that of the chot’uul (Dream Watchers). These monks learn how to manipulate reality as one might shape a dream, producing the dramatic effects of a Warrior of the Elements. Most chot’uul are part of the reclusive Kech Uul, but most kech vaults have a small, dedicated group of dream guardians.</p>
    <p><strong>Ranger.</strong> The golin’dar of the Taarka’khesh are legendary scouts and skirmishers, the most common Rangers among the Dhakaani. However, guul’dar and ghaal’dar may also train as skirmishers. Typically, the cavalry are Beast Master Rangers, working with worgs or tigers. Skirmishers are often Hunters or Gloom Stalkers.</p>
    <p><strong>Rogue.</strong> Typically, the Kech Dhakaan face their foes in open combat. The arts of the Rogue are the domain of the Khesh’dar goblins, who operate in the shadows of the empire. While the Shaarat’khesh are best known for their Assassins, specialists can be found following almost any archetype. The Silent Folk train and can dispatch Thieves when necessary. Arcane Tricksters have adapted a form of the duur’kala’s magic. And if you’re using Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, Inquisitive rogues are the top spies of the Khesh’dar, while a handful of Masterminds serve as expert strategists. It’s entirely possible to run a campaign around a team of Shaarat’khesh Rogues with different specialties, with the Khesh’dar serving as an espionage patron. Outside of the Khesh’dar, the Kech Nasaar are the only clan that regularly trains ghaal’dar spies and assassins.</p>
    <p>Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard. At the height of the Empire of Dhakaan, the only common spellcasters were artificers and bards. Focused on martial discipline, the Dhakaani never unlocked the secrets of wizardry or embraced eldritch bargains—but today, the Kech Volaar are actively trying to bridge this gap in their arsenal. As a Volaar Wizard, you can follow any path; the key is that you are likely a trailblazer and your accomplishments and discoveries may be very important to your people. There is no established tradition of sorcery among the Dhakaani, but the Volaar are likewise seeking out any dar who show signs of sorcerous potential. The clan has even been experimenting with warlocks, actively seeking out arcane patrons and attempted controlled studies. So as a Volaar Warlock, you might be the first dar to work with this particular patron, and your superiors are eager to see how it turns out.</p>
    <p>There are a few other options for arcane spellcasters. Depending on the path the DM decides to take with the Kech Hashraac, they could be training Evokers; like the Volaar Wizards, this would reflect cutting-edge research. The Kech Nasaar have been studying necromancy for a long time and may have developed Necromancer Wizards. The Nasaar are more willing than most to dally with sinister powers, and it’s likewise possible that they’ve had a tradition of Warlocks.</p>
    <p>Cleric, Druid, Paladin. The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don’t believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate. It is possible to play a Dhakaani Paladin who draws their divine power from their absolute devotion to the empire, or a Cleric who channels power from the Uul Dhakaan. But this was always intended as an intentional gap in the capabilities of the Dhakaani: they have far greater martial skill than most of the cultures of Khorvaire, but they simply don’t have access to divine magic.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Species</h4>

    <p>Chapter 6 presents new species options for Dhakaani goblinoids. If you’re playing a dar, your traits are determined by whether you’re a golin’dar (goblin), ghaal’dar (hobgoblin), or guul’dar (bugbear). The terms goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear are part of the Common tongue, introduced by human settlers. While most modern goblinoids have adopted these terms themselves, the dar maintain the old ways.</p>
    <p><strong>Eberron:</strong> Rising from the Last War provided species traits for Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Bugbears, but those represent the modern goblinoids, denizens of Darguun and Droaam whose ancestors were touched by the Kapaa’vola of Dyrrn the Corruptor. While the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan—the dar—are physically identical to their modern cousins, there are some important differences. The dar are bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system. As one of the dar, you know your place in society and have undergone intense training to hone your natural strengths. The species options in chapter 6 reflect that training, and if you were raised outside of Dhakaani society, you should instead use the standard goblinoid traits.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">The Mror Holds</h2>

    <p>Tol kollan! Some say our ancestors came from a place of ice, but we all know that’s nonsense. Our ancestors were the mountains themselves. The dragons were jealous of their mighty stature, so they cast a spell that put them all to sleep, and that’s where the mountains come from. We dwarves? We’re the sweat from their brow. Don’t believe me? Go take a look at the Face of Mror! No one could carve something like that, my friend; that’s the mountain’s original face. As for the others, well, they just went to sleep face down. That’s the tale I had from my father, and you wouldn’t want to call him a liar!</p>
    <p>Despite their long lives, the Mror dwarves are surprisingly unconcerned with recording the past. They care deeply about family. They cling to property, whether it’s land or more portable possessions. They’re fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, “The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way.” Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions—these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history interesting. A particular story could be placed in three different centuries by three different clans, and the villain of one tale could be the hero in the neighboring holdfast.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Mror History</h3>

    <p>Dwarves aren’t native to Khorvaire, but no one knows exactly how or when they arrived. Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that’s enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization—or ruins of it—waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there’s no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sol Udar: The Realm Below</h4>

    <p>Wherever the dwarves came from, they sunk their roots into the soil of Khorvaire. Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records—which are more accurate than those of the dwarves—show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn’t worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call Sol Udar, the Realm Below.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Mallanok: The Exile</h4>

    <p>The next major era in Mror history was Mallanok, the Exile. At some point—whether years or centuries later is unclear—a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn’t decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dul Krok: Bloody Stones</h4>

    <p>The Exile was followed by Dul Krok, Bloody Stones. When humanity came to Khorvaire, the Ironroot Mountains were divided between thirteen powerful clans of dwarves. These mountain dwarves were proud and warlike, but they were mired in feuds—and these ancient conflicts kept them from substantially advancing their culture or their influence in the world. Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren’t the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what’s now the Lhazaar Principalities. It was largely these Lhazaar dwarves who integrated with humanity, spreading west with them, though there were also a few Mror who left their feuds behind to help build the foundations of the new kingdoms.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Bal Dulor: The Great Sorrow</h4>

    <p>As the Five Nations took form, humanity largely shunned the Ironroot Mountains and left the dwarves to their feuding. Following the rise of the united kingdom of Galifar, Prince Karrn finally made a concerted effort to pacify the mountain dwarves. This time is known as Bal Dulor, the Great Sorrow. The soldiers of Galifar were disciplined and took advantage of the existing feuds, isolating the clans or pitting them against one another. The central fortresses of the holds were impregnable, but Galifar held the surrounding lands; the compromise that followed left the dwarves as lords of their territories, but as subjects of Galifar, forced to pay tribute and taxes.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Korran Hal: Korran&apos;s Blessing</h4>

    <p>While the Great Sorrow was a source of deep shame to the dwarves, it brought a forced end to their violent feuds and forced them to raise the funds to pay their tribute. Warriors became miners, and the Ironroot Mountains proved to be an astonishingly rich source of mineral wealth. Mror talespinners say that the Sovereign Onatar had his forge in the mountains, and that Kol Korran kept his hoard beneath it; other scholars have speculated that there could be a more unsavory supernatural force at work, an overlord tied to greed bound beneath the peaks. Whatever the truth, this led to the period known as Korran Hal, Korran’s Blessing. Even with the taxes owed to Galifar, the Mror prospered and built a thriving society. While the ancient feuds were never forgotten, violence was no longer their first answer. The bearers of the Dragonmark of Warding, Clan Kundarak, were drawn into the Twelve and became House Kundarak. Working closely with House Sivis, Kundarak parleyed its wealth and the power of its dragonmark to establish the Banking Guild, and the influence of Kundarak helped to drive a further wave of cultural advancement.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tra Halor: The Revelation</h4>

    <p>As the dwarves expanded their mines and fortress holds, they’d occasionally find tunnels and outposts that seemed to be tied to Sol Udar—outposts that appeared to have been abandoned many thousands of years ago. The dwarves continued to dig deeper toward the Realm Below, and this led to a wave of breakthroughs in the early tenth century, an event broadly known as tra Halor, the Revelation. Miners and masons found evidence of a vast, wondrous subterranean empire, with enormous city-halls below all of the modern holds. Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses. It was clear that these cities had been built by dwarves, and it speaks to Mror character that rather than pondering the fate of the builders of this abandoned realm, the dwarves simply embraced this as a miraculous stroke of fortune and proof of their collective destiny.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Mror Solu: The Realms of Iron</h4>

    <p>By this time, the Last War was underway. For the last decade, Karrnath had been steadily raising taxes and demanding troop levies. But the dwarves were conquered long ago by Galifar, whereas Karrnath was just a piece of that broken kingdom. Inspired by Sol Udar and recognizing how far their people had come since the Great Sorrow, the lords of the holds convened in Mror Aulan, the Iron Council. The lords of the Iron Council affirmed their union and declared the sovereignty of Mror Solu—the Realms of Iron—a name which even the Mror themselves usually translate into Common as the Mror Holds. It’s worth noting that in calling themselves the Mror, dwarves aren’t professing fealty to Clan Mroranon or the ancient king of Sol Udar; rather, they’re simply calling themselves “the Ironfolk.”</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dol Udar: The War Below</h4>

    <p>The time that followed was initially known as Aul Aur, the Age of Gold. While Karrnath engaged in retaliatory actions during the Last War, it was struggling with famine and against its neighbors, and lacked the power to stop the rebellion. The dwarves expanded and explored Sol Udar, reclaiming wondrous relics and facilities. But soon they learned what had become of the ancient dwarves of the Realm Below, and why the kingdom had never reached up to the exiles. The ancient dwarves had been wiped out thousands of years ago by the daelkyr, for Sol Udar abutted on the demiplane prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the mightiest of the daelkyr. The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone—and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths. Entire colonies were lost and consumed by illithid corruption. While the Five Nations fought the Last War, the Mror fell into Dol Udar, the War Below, discussed in more detail later in “The Realm Below” section.</p>
    <p>Today, the Mror Holds are in a stalemate against the aberrations below, and remain balanced between the Age of Gold and the War Below. Even with their current holdings, the dwarves continue to draw vast wealth from their mines. Clans take pride in the treasures reclaimed from the depths, and Mror artificers continue to learn from studying ancient Artifacts. Though the dwarves are few in number, their economic power and strong fortifications have deterred any Karrnathi retribution, and no one challenged their recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold. The dwarves are proud and prosperous—and yet, old feuds linger. The Realm Below remains both a glorious lure and a deadly threat. And tensions are further exacerbated by the other treasures recovered from the depths—tools made not by dwarves, but by the daelkyr.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">What Defines the Mror?</h3>

    <p><strong>Dwarves aren’t human.</strong> In creating a Mror character, it can help to reflect on the ways dwarves differ from humans. Clan plays a significant role in Mror culture; especially in the wake of rediscovering the Realm Below, a Mroranon dwarf is quite different from a Soldorak dwarf. But there are a few common things that can be borne in mind for any Mror character.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Biology</h4>

    <p>While the dwarves of the Realm Below may have spent their entire lives below the surface, the Mror dwarves were born on the surface of the Ironroot Mountains. Mror dwarves appreciate sunlight and color, and their buildings typically have windows, but dwarves don’t need light. Absolute darkness impairs their Darkvision, but this is merely inconvenient, not unbearable, and many mine tunnels and stretches of the Realm Below have no light sources.</p>
    <p>Resulting from this, the circadian rhythms of dwarves are more flexible than those of humans. While it’s important to maintain a regular schedule, day and night have little meaning for the Mror. Mror communities are active at all hours, and major Mror businesses are continuously open. “Nightlife” isn’t a concept in Mror society, and entertainment can likewise be found at all hours, so traveling Mror are often frustrated by the limited opportunities in human communities.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The War Below</h4>

    <p>Characters from the Five Nations are shaped by the Last War, and similarly, Mror are shaped by Dol Udar, the War Below. Currently, this conflict is simmering, but there has been no victory and the threat remains. When the war was at its height, all Mror lived in daily fear of aberrant attacks and society’s resources were devoted to the war effort. The Mror Holds are smaller than the Five Nations, and the impact of the conflict was intense. All civilians engaged in combat drills in preparation for dolgrim assault, and everyone was expected to contribute to the war effort—repairing or producing arms and armor, maintaining fortifications, or fighting.</p>
    <p>In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider how the war affected you and how this is reflected by your class and proficiencies. A few questions to consider...</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Did you fight on the front lines, battling aberrations in the depths? If so, what’s the most terrifying thing you saw in the conflict? Are you scarred by your experiences, or does nothing scare you anymore?</li>
            <li>If you didn’t fight in the Realm Below, did you serve on any civilian support brigades? Did you spend your childhood sharpening axes and repairing armor? Were you kept out of the conflict by family connections, or did you refuse to serve?</li>
            <li>Who or what did you lose to the conflict? Did you have a stake in a colony or mine that had to be abandoned? Do you have a sibling or lover lost in the depths—and if so, are you sure that they’re dead, or could they be prisoners of Dyrrn?</li>
            <li>Do you dream of delving deeper into the depths, or would you rather see the Realm Below sealed away forever?</li>
    </ul>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Family First</h4>

    <p>The Mror Holds are a feudal society, composed of holds, spires, and families. There are twelve active holds, each governed by a ruling clan, which gives its name to the hold—so Droranathhold is ruled by Clan Droranath. Each hold is then broken up into smaller territories known as spires, each ruled by a clan; there are ancient ties of kinship and marriage between clans and the ruling clan. Within a spire, families maintain tenant relationships with the local clan. Land is held by a clan or family, and most businesses are family businesses. Families are long established, and the creation of a new family is an extremely rare event.</p>
    <p>The Mror engage with their history through stories, and clans and families are the characters in those stories. Typically, a Mror tale refers to heroes and villains solely by their family names. So in Mroranon and the Troll King, it doesn’t matter exactly when the story took place or which specific Mroranon it was; it’s a story about Mroranon. In one tale, he is a heroic youth, and in another, she is a battle-scarred veteran, and yet they’re depicted as the same Mroranon. And in both cases, all Mroranon dwarves should strive to live up to that example. Where the Tairnadal elves seek to emulate specific ancestors, Mror dwarves view their family as a greater whole. Your family is a direct extension of your identity; it’s only natural that you’d help a family member in need, and betraying a family member is like stabbing yourself in the hand. This drives feuds and alliances; if you’re wronged by a Hronnath dwarf, the blame lies with Clan Hronnath, not simply the individual. To draw another comparison to the elves, the Aereni preserve their ancestors as deathless undead. In contrast, the Mror don’t feel that need to preserve individuals; you preserve your family by living up to its character and by adding to its story. The Mror also aren’t as particular about precisely following the traditions of ancestors, as shown by the clans that are embracing symbionts; what you do is less important than how you do it, the values you stand for, and the lines you refuse to cross.</p>
    <p>This doesn’t mean that Mror don’t take personal responsibility for their actions or feel pride in their personal deeds. The deeds of living dwarves are generally acknowledged by name, but when they take their place in history, their names are unlikely to be remembered. Instead, every dwarf hopes that their grand deeds will be added to the trove of stories told of their family—and that they won’t shame their family with the memories of their misdeeds.</p>
    <p>In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider your family. Are you part of a clan or ruling clan? If so, are you close enough to power to take the Noble background, or are you a lesser heir? Are you from a tenant family, and if so, what is your family’s business? Even more crucial, what is your family’s character? When people tell stories about your family, what are the virtues they highlight? Are there any particular things your family is known for, any celebrated deeds you might emulate, or anything a member of your family should never do? Some families have specific taboos; a Tronnan must never break their word, while a Holladon never turns away a guest. Does your family have any such traditions?</p>
    <p>Also consider how your family was affected by the Dol Udar. Did they invest deeply in the depths, only to suffer grievous losses when the horrors rose? Did they fight on the front lines, or largely remain above? Do they have a family treasure recovered from the Realm Below—a Legendary item or Artifact you might someday have the honor to wield? Are they willing to embrace symbionts, or are they disgusted by the tools of the daelkyr?</p>
    <p>Finally, what is your standing with your family? If it’s good, consider why you left the Mror Holds; chapter 1 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War includes a table with suggestions for this. If your standing is bad, what happened? Is it a situation you hope to fix, or have you turned your back on your family? As a player, talk to your DM about the role your family might play in a campaign; do you want to have cousins showing up in need of assistance or to be drawn into new feuds, or would you rather your family remain in your backstory?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Long Life and Treasured Stories</h4>

    <p>The Mror attitude toward family is one example of how they deal with their long lives. A dwarf can live to be up to 350 years old; intellectually, they mature at about the same rate as humans, but they generally aren’t considered to be full adults until around 50 years of age. This ties to the fact that dwarves have a low fertility rate and their reproductive peak is between 50 and 120. While under 50, a Mror dwarf is usually learning the family trade and working directly for their parents, uncles, or aunts; at 50 and above, a dwarf starts thinking about starting their own branch of the family tree and the family trade.</p>
    <p>In stark contrast to the elves of Aerenal, the Mror dwarves deal with their long lives by largely ignoring the passage of time: they intentionally don’t record every detail or remember every person, instead simply holding on to the best moments and ideas. To them, the story matters more than the concrete facts. Individuals come and go, but the family remains, and the story continues. And the Mror deeply love stories. Like the dar, they prefer stories to be based on fact as opposed to being absolute fiction—but to the Mror, a story should always be entertaining, and as long as the spirit is true, it’s fine to exaggerate the details. So while the talespinner bard serves as a keeper of history, their role as entertainers is as important—if not more so—than their role as sage.</p>
    <p>Mror dwarves can be seen as boastful by outsiders, quick to share tales of their exploits. However, they don’t seek to dominate every conversation with their tales, but expect others to share their stories as well—and if others don’t, Mror are quick to boast about the deeds of their companions. Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase Tol kollan—or the Common translation, “That reminds me of a story.” Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales. In playing a Mror character, you might come up with a few stories you love, as well as taking joy in dramatically retelling the story of your adventures—the deeds of both you and your fellow adventurers—celebrating and highlighting your finest moments.</p>
    <p>Mror Families and Dragonmarked Houses</p>
    <p>Most Mror businesses are family businesses passed down over generations. However, families can and do adapt to deal with changing circumstances. In particular, the arrival of the dragonmarked houses forced many families to change their paths or to find a way to work with the houses. The Jolnar family of Toldrathhold had been healers for generations, but they couldn’t match the healing capabilities of House Jorasco. Over time, the Jolnar shifted their focus to cultivating medicinal herbs and other supplies needed by Jorasco. They are still devoted to the health of others, but they’ve found a way to work with Jorasco instead of directly challenging it.</p>
    <p>In short, Mror families are more flexible than the Tairnadal or Aereni. They are willing to change their specific traditions or techniques to adapt to changing times; what matters is remaining true to the core values of the family.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Grand Gifts and Storied Treasures</h4>

    <p>The Mror are known for their love of objects—their love of treasure. In part, this ties to a deep appreciation of quality work. The dwarves appreciate beautiful things, but durability and functionality are far more important—as shown by the willingness of many dwarves to embrace grotesque symbionts. However, the dwarves are not greedy hoarders; while there are certain families known for their thrift, generosity is an important virtue to the Mror. As much as they value their treasures, there’s joy in giving the perfect gift—showing that you can afford to give away a treasure, and that you recognize someone who will appreciate it and make good use of it. A common tradition at a grand feast is for each of the greatest heroes present—typically, the scions of ruling clans—to offer a gift to the host along with a tale of how they came by the gift; the one who gives the finest gift is served first at the feast.</p>
    <p>While you may not have many feasts, consider this tradition when you have time and opportunity. Is there a chance to give a comrade a perfect gift? Is there a treasure you possess that might be better suited to one of your companions?</p>
    <p>The Mror are deeply interested in objects with stories of their own. Every family has their own family treasures. Sometimes these are the most powerful magic items the dwarves have acquired, notably the case with Artifacts and Legendary items that have been recovered from the Realm Below over the last century; part of the pride of the ruling clans is derived from the treasures they can boast of. But a family treasure can also be a mundane item that has been a part of many epic stories. As noted earlier, no one cares which specific Mroranon heir was the hero of Mroranon and the Troll King. But if the house still has the bracer that hero made from the troll king’s nose ring, carrying this relic is a tremendous source of pride. As a Mror adventurer, when you find treasures, you want to know the stories they are already carrying—who forged this Flame Tongue Shortsword and what battles has it seen? Also consider the items you possess that you feel a strong attachment to—how are their stories evolving along with yours?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Fashion</h4>

    <p>Clothes tell a story, and Mror dwarves love to tell tales with them—of clan and family, faith, and personality. As with most Mror possessions, the quality of clothing comes first. Because of this, dwarves from lesser families may only have a single set of clothing, but these are durable and well made. Though their basic outfits may be few, Mror place great stock in accessories, and a Mror outfit typically has elements that can be reversed, shifted, or removed. Brooches have important cultural significance, and can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, the symbol of a Sovereign whose favor is sought, or even moods; some brooches mean “leave me alone” or “looking for company.” Other forms of jewelry—rings, chains, bracelets—are commonly worn by dwarves of both genders; this is an opportunity to show wealth, but decorative ornaments of iron are also worn by common folk. The dultar—blood blade—is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar. Any Mror dwarf can immediately identify another dwarf’s clan from their dultar; for an outsider to recognize one, it requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check.</p>
    <p>Many Mror clans favor a martial aspect to their attire, especially in the wake of Dol Udar. However, not everyone wants to wear heavy steel all day, and the Mror generally use light alloys and thin layers of metal to craft their armor. Many Mror wear decorative armor that uses the statistics of Light armor, but evokes the general flavor of a heavier Breastplate—though anyone proficient in Medium or Heavy armor immediately recognizes the decorative nature of it.</p>
    <p>Facial hair is common among the Mror, but styles vary by clan and family. Some families prefer neatly trimmed beards. Many clans weave beads into beards, with the design of the bead invoking the favor of a Sovereign or honoring a clan. Hair dye is often used as a form of personal expression.</p>
    <p>Clans that have embraced the use of symbionts—notably Soldorak, Toranath, and Narathun—have developed many exotic fashions over the last century. For such dwarves, wearing symbiont clothing or accessories is a sign of courage and power, much as a hunter might wear the hides of animals they’ve defeated. Living clothing typically has a texture similar to leather, though chitin plating or hornlike protrusions are possible. Patterns or colors may shift to reflect the mood of the wearer, and a living cloak may ripple or billow of its own accord. Living clothing is self-cleaning and mending, and feeds on the excretions (primarily sweat) of the host. Narathun currently has the finest artisan-breeders working with living clothing, and styles are constantly evolving.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cuisine</h4>

    <p>Mror dwarves have exceptional constitutions and are resistant to poison, and thanks to these traits, they enjoy cuisine that others might avoid. The dwarves live in high mountains and subterranean settlements; while some of their meats and vegetables are familiar to the people of the Five Nations, they also use a wide variety of mushrooms and moss. Red pudding is a form of peaceful ooze raised as livestock and used in a variety of dishes. Mror stew can sicken creatures with more delicate stomachs, but it’s entirely harmless to any creature resistant to Poison damage.</p>
    <p>Alcohol is also a form of poison, and Mror spirits have to be exceptionally strong for sturdy dwarves to enjoy their mind-altering properties. Mror brewers often use mushrooms to produce alcohol, and also produce mushroom-based beverages with light hallucinogenic effects. The drinks of the Five Nations are extremely weak by Mror standards, and some consider the ability to brew personal supplies to be a basic survival tool when traveling in foreign lands. And when outsiders visit the Mror, their hosts are careful to keep these travelers from buying drinks that could kill them.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Religion</h4>

    <p>Mror talespinners maintain that the dwarves are the original chosen people of the Sovereigns, especially Kol Korran and Onatar. It’s a curious coincidence that kol is the Dwarvish word for “commerce,” while dol means “war,” and the talespinners say the Traveler stole the names of the Sovereigns from the dwarves during the Exile. The priests of Krona Peak say that Kol Korran came to the hero Mroranon and promised the dwarves wealth if they remembered his name and followed his path, while the talespinners of Doldarunhold swear that the hero Doldarun was the son of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah. The records of the Library of Korranberg show that Zil missionaries were active in the Ironroots in the centuries before Bal Dulor, and some sages assert that these tales may have been the work of clever missionaries. Whatever the truth, the Mror already had shrines to the Sovereigns when young Karrn led his forces to conquer the holds.</p>
    <p>While the Mror broadly acknowledge all of the Sovereigns, Kol Korran and Onatar are the most beloved; Boldrei and Olladra are also often invoked. Clan Doldarun, Mroranon, and Soranath are especially devout, while Droranath, Soldorak, and Toldorath are the most pragmatic. The Blood of Vol and the Dark Six have small followings in Narathun.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Realm Below</h3>

    <p>Each clan holds dominion over a spire, with the ruling clans laying claim to all remaining land within a hold. Critically, a clan holds domain both over its territory and all that lies below it. Early in the tenth century, miners in multiple holds broke through to the Realm Below. Wide tunnels shaped by elemental magic led to grand halls and subterranean cities crafted with techniques far beyond those of the modern Mror earthmovers. Avenues were lit by Continual Flame, and environmental enchantments ensured purity of air and comfortable climate. One might think the dwarves would have been more curious about the fate of the builders, but the ancient halls were entirely empty, with no signs of blood or bone. To those who discovered them, these empty halls were not foreboding, but a gift from the Sovereigns—a wondrous realm waiting for residents.</p>
    <p>Clan leaders proceeded with caution, but were lured in as greater wonders were discovered. Ancient forges held the promise of forgotten techniques that could yet be reclaimed. Explorers returned with ornaments of gold and silver, found simply lying around the avenues for the taking. And there were mines—mines far safer and grander than those above, yet still containing riches. In time, explorers would realize that some of the richest mines were not entirely natural—that some shafts connect to demiplanes where the rules of reality don’t always apply, like mines where emeralds grow like moss. This, too, could have been a warning, but the clan rulers were dazzled by wonder and opportunity. Expeditions moved into these upper levels, establishing colonies in the Realm Below. Miners began working the ancient veins, and smiths brought some of the forgotten foundries back online.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The War Below</h4>

    <p>For a time, it seemed like a golden age. No one knows exactly what brought it to an end. It may be the fault of adventurers and explorers who pressed too deep, ever searching for greater treasures. Or it could be that Dyrrn and its minions were watching the Mror expansion all along, waiting for the civilian population in the subterranean colonies to reach a critical level. At first, scouts brought back reports of newly exposed tunnels and chambers, of passages coated with unnatural fluids and strange things growing among mushroom gardens. Then the scouts stopped returning and the first wave of attacks began. Squads of dolgrims. Chokers lurking in the shadows. Soldorakhold faced howling mobs of derro—possibly the twisted survivors of Noldrunhold, the Lost Clan (described later in this chapter). Strange plagues and implacable oozes spread through the sunken colonies of Londurak. It was a time of terror, but also determination: whatever this unknown threat was, it must be held in the depths at any cost.</p>
    <p>Armies were rallied, clans sending their finest soldiers into the depths, while every citizen trained with axe and hammer in preparation for dolgrim raids or a more dramatic surface assault. While some clans considered withdrawal, pride and a hunger for the wealth and wonders still hidden kept the dwarves fighting. They believed if they didn’t hold them below, the aberrations would merely follow them to the surface. The years that followed were a time of endless terror and uncertainty. As the horrors were driven back in one hold, they would strike with redoubled force in another. New threats appeared with alarming regularity; dolgrims and derro were common foes, but there was no telling when a previously unknown danger would rise.</p>
    <p>Two major discoveries shaped the second decade of the war. The first was the revelation of the enemy the Mror faced: the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. In 943 YK, the illithid Dyrrashar seized the colony below Loran’s Gate in Soldorakhold, and broadcast a psychic message known as Dyrrn’s Promise. This telepathic message didn’t take the form of words, and attempts to transcribe it have produced widely varied translations. But the thrust was this: “You have drawn the gaze of the Overmind. You walk the Foul Labyrinth. Everything will change.” Clan Soldorak eventually retook Loran’s Gate and forced Dyrrashar to retreat, but the illithid general has risen elsewhere and remains at large today. None who experienced Dyrrn’s Promise can ever forget it.</p>
    <p>Even as Dyrrn’s Promise spread fear, a second discovery brought hope. Following grave losses, Clan Londurak withdrew its forces to the surface. The Londurak prepared their defenses for a surface attack... but it never came. This pattern was repeated in other spires and holds; though the reasons are unclear, Dyrrn’s forces won’t pursue their enemies beyond Sol Udar.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Stalemate in the Depths</h4>

    <p>Nobody’s sure why the aberrations avoid attacking the surface in force. Sages theorize it’s tied to the wards that bind Dyrrn within its demiplane, and the aberrations only venture so far from the realm of their master. Or perhaps it’s just a tactical choice. Regardless of the reason, the war has been in a stalemate over the last few years. But many sages believe that complacency is foolish, and until they know with absolute certainty what keeps Dyrrn’s forces from rising to the surface, they can’t know their protection will last. And even if the dolgrim hordes won’t leave the tunnels and there’s no threat of a large-scale assault, the Slithering Lord could be unfolding more subtle schemes.</p>
    <p>Londurakhold and Tordannonhold have both pulled back from the war, fortifying all passages to the Realm Below and forbidding any traffic with the depths; they ignore the Realm Below, believing that if they don’t poke the stirge’s nest, the aberrations won’t threaten them. Most of the other major clans maintain lines in the depths, defending claimed mines and colonies with steel and blood. These territories are secured by heavy fortifications, strong enough to repel attack, though serving on the line is a dangerous job. But the dwarves aren’t trying to press beyond their current lines, for if they venture across it, their fate is unknown.</p>
    <p>The future of the war remains unclear. Many of the clan lords yearn to press deeper. But there have been all too many casualties over the past few decades, and there is still considerable fear that the current lull is a trick—that Dyrrn is building forces for a renewed assault. And no one knows if there is a way to win the war once and for all, or if it’s just a matter of advancing the line another hundred feet. Ultimately, it’s up to the DM to decide whether the war remains as a lurking threat, or if it heats up and dominates the story.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Ripples on the Surface</h4>

    <p>While the aberrations have yet to come to the surface in force, the war is ongoing, and it can be felt on the surface. Individual aberrations occasionally come to the surface; a lone choker might carry out a spree of killings, or an illithid could rise to work with a dwarf cult. Psychic attacks, unnatural diseases, and other threats can emanate from the depths.</p>
    <p>In the past three decades, the touch of Dyrrn has become seen even in the children born to the Mror dwarves. Very rarely, an infant born to ordinary parents is different. Known as ruinbound dwarves, these unusual infants are born with a personal symbiont bound to them, along with other unnerving mutations—and unexpected powers. Chapter 6 contains more information about ruinbound dwarves (and their reception amongst the Mror), along with a playable species.</p>
    <p>The Influence of Dyrrn table gives examples of threats that could arise either in a subterranean colony or on the surface itself. These things aren’t common, and clan soldiers are ever wary to repel threats, but these ideas could drive a story set in a Mror community.</p>
    <p>It’s important to recognize the scope of the conflict in the depths. No one knows the full size of the Realm Below, though it appears to stretch across the Ironroot Mountains, and connects to multiple demiplanes in Khyber. There’s a good chance it exists below every major Mror city, but not every spire has broken through and made a connection to Sol Udar. When creating adventures in a Mror city, decide if there is an established passage to the Realm Below; if so, is it a simple passage, or is there a subterranean fortress or colony? In a spire with no known connection, a cult could be secretly digging to try to reach their aberrant masters. Or a clan could have opened a passage beneath its keep but lacked the courage to explore it—a job for adventurers.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Venturing Below</h4>

    <p>To an outsider, the idea of pressing into the Realms Below may seem like madness, but several factors drive the ongoing Mror presence in the depths. The first is a hunger for the wonders that lie below. The ancient dwarves possessed the ability to craft Legendary objects and Artifacts. They understood Khyber’s systems of demiplanes in a way even the Dhakaani haven’t mastered; many clan lords dream of bottomless mines or resources that can’t be found in the natural world. Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it’s a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright. It’s a burning reminder that they could be more than they are now—they could be greater than the Five Nations or the Aereni. Additionally, many dwarves are driven by their desire to know the story—to understand who their ancestors were and what became of them.</p>
    <p>If a player character is a Mror Noble, the Realm Below can be a tempting opportunity for advancement. The clans hold all lands below their territory. If a noble with a stalwart band of allies can secure an outpost in Sol Udar and fortify against the forces of Dyrrn, they can claim it as their personal estate. This could be a remarkable keep for a party of adventurers—if they are powerful enough to maintain it! The Realm Below Story Hooks table contains some more ideas for why adventurers might delve into the Realm Below.</p>

  </table>

    <p>The lines between regions secured by the Mror and those held by Dyrrn’s forces are clearly marked. As the aberrations generally don’t come to the surface, there are places where the uppermost passage has simply been sealed with magic and steel. In other places where the dwarves have established colonies, the edge of the colony is heavily fortified and patrolled by soldiers, ever alert for some new attack. In most cases, soldiers won’t prevent someone from proceeding into the depths—but anyone returning goes through careful scrutiny to ensure they haven’t been infected by unnatural influences. And if an explorer has returned with treasures, it’s considered polite to offer a gift to the guardians.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Into the Silent Halls</h4>

    <p>The Realm Below blends the civilization of Sol Udar with the alien touch of the daelkyr. The dwarves of Sol Udar were an advanced civilization employing arcane science beyond that currently possessed by the Five Nations. The halls were shaped by elemental magic—an improved form of the Move Earth spell—and reinforced to be stronger than any natural stone. Barring any alien influence, the air is renewed by magic and remarkably fresh; a permanent Prestidigitation effect keeps these halls clean after thousands of years and untold conflicts. Ultimately, venturing into this environment can be somewhat eerie: though there may have been a brutal battle there just months ago, the halls are silent and pristine.</p>
    <p>Widespread magic was a part of daily life in Sol Udar. Explorers might find a chamber where illusory music begins to play as soon as someone enters, or discover a theater still performing ancient entertainment. Many doors are sealed by Arcane Locks, and high-security areas may have self-restoring Glyphs of Warding or more sophisticated security. The people of Sol Udar weren’t warlike by nature. Their halls contain great forges and foundries, but many of their wonders are utilitarian. An Udar kitchen has tools that replicate the heating, chilling, and flavoring effects of Prestidigitation, and might have a builtin Alchemy Jug to dispense whatever liquids are needed. Of course, not all enchantments are automatically noticeable, and many effects require some form of command word or gesture to activate; modern colonists who have settled in the upper levels of Sol Udar are still struggling to understand the full capabilities of their new home.</p>
    <p>The dwarves of Sol Udar also took advantage of the many demiplanes that lie within Khyber, identifying passages to them and building around them, just as the people of the surface build around manifest zones. A typical demiplane portal is clearly marked and heavily secured, of great potential value—and danger—as they can break the laws of the natural world. Demiplanes are entirely unpredictable in size, some no larger than a town, with others the size of Khorvaire itself. Within a demiplane, time might run differently. Gemstones could grow on trees. A demiplane can have its own sun, and provide vegetation and other resources that couldn’t be found in any natural cave. But a demiplane could also hold strange curses, unnatural diseases, or deadly creatures—or in the case of Dyrrn’s prison-realm, all three.</p>
    <p>The Realm Below isn’t one single contiguous community. It was an entire nation, one that stretched at least the length of the Ironroot Mountains. There are major cities, small outposts, and long passages connecting them. The Realm Below likely had some form of rapid transit: Teleportation circles? Something similar to the lightning rail? A system tied to demiplanes? Whatever this was, it has yet to be discovered, and may lie on the lower levels held by Dyrrn’s minions. In creating a section of the Realm Below for an adventure, the DM should think about the purpose of this particular area. Was it an industrial center? A residential community? A hospital? A prison? If it contains a passage to a demiplane, the nature of the demiplane should relate to the function of the community; if it’s a hospital, perhaps the local demiplane has alien vegetation that has remarkable medicinal properties. But what unknown threats could dwell in the demiplane—threats the ancient dwarves knew to avoid?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Denizens of the Deep</h4>

    <p>Dyrrn’s minions have spread throughout the lower reaches of Sol Udar. Areas inhabited by aberrations are generally easy to spot. Often, organic matter covers the surfaces of the buildings. Explorers have encountered fleshlike coating, with tendrils of muscle spread out like spiderwebs; organic fluids that move along the walls, a harmless form of living ooze; floating, bioluminescent globes that could be neurons in a vast brain; and other, stranger things. There are strange smells and sounds. People often experience telepathic static, hearing thoughts of people around them or having flashes of alien imagery. Areas infested by the daelkyr may use any of the traps found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, but in this realm, hazards are generally alive. A falling net is a web-like membrane secreted by the ceiling. Poison darts are chitinous stingers grown by the walls. These traps can still be evaded by the standard methods, though at the DM’s discretion, unusual skills could also apply; perhaps an organic poison needle trap could be disarmed with a Dexterity (Medicine) check instead of using Thieves’ Tools.</p>
    <p>Dyrrn’s specialty is corruption, both mental and physical. Thus it has created creatures like the dolgrims and dolgaunts—goblinoids physically transformed into monsters, the most prolific denizens of the dark—as well as the derro, who still bear some resemblance to the dwarves they once were, but whose minds have been altered.</p>
    <p>Dolgaunts often command units of dolgrims, but dolgaunts can also be found acting alone or maintaining strange shrines. The statistics presented in Eberron: Rising from the Last War represent the typical creature, but unique dols can have greater abilities. Dols are capable of acting with surprising discipline and precision, but their strategies are often unorthodox and enigmatic.</p>
    <p>Derro are believed to be dwarves twisted by Dyrrn’s power. There may be derro whose roots go back to the ancient dwarves who built Sol Udar; however, the common assumption is that the derro are the descendants of the lost dwarves of Noldrunhold. Other derro could be more recent victims, created from Mror settlers captured in the Dol Udar. The derro are nomadic scavengers who remain in constant motion, roaming the deep tunnels of the Realm Below. They completely ignore Dyrrn’s aberrations, and seem to be ignored in turn; one scout reported seeing a derro band walk through a dolgrim camp, without acknowledgement from either side. Some scholars believe that the derro can’t perceive the aberrations, and that some believe themselves to be in a reality in which Sol Udar is still in its time of glory, and the derro are its lords. They don’t appear to serve Dyrrn directly, but they definitely see all outsiders from above as enemies. A derro warlord calling himself Lord Mror has repeatedly attacked Mror colonies; however, it’s unclear if this is a single powerful derro with followers across the realm, or if several derro savants use this title.</p>
    <p>The daelkyr often hold the most important areas of an Udar site; as such, these dungeons contain both treasures created by the dwarves and the organic tools of the daelkyr. However, the purpose of areas claimed by Dyrrn’s forces varies widely. In some cases, there’s a clear logic to what these creatures are doing: dolgrims could have seized an ancient foundry and begun forging weapons. Explorers could find some sort of spawning pit where new aberrations are being produced. But the behavior of aberrations is often alien and inexplicable; a chamber could contain a giant, beating heart that serves no apparent purpose, or a pool of liquid that reflects another location. The inhabitants of the depths are unpredictable, and aberrations may not have the same biological needs as natural humanoids; for example, dolgrims don’t need to work subterranean farms for food.</p>
    <p>Some aberrations are permanently settled in a region, but others may spill out of portals to Dyrrn’s domain, and others may be grown on the spot by the organic matter spread throughout infested regions, or created from the corpses of foolish explorers. A gibbering mouther may whisper with the voices of the dwarves who ventured into the depths last week.</p>
    <p>While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn’s emissaries and lieutenants—directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn’s Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.</p>
    <p>Most other threats are encountered in isolation, and almost any sort of aberration could be found in the darkness; you can also use unusual variations of aberrations or monstrosities, shifting the creature to fit your story. For example, beholders primarily serve Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, but Dyrrn could have beholder servitors with beaks surrounded with tentacles, as opposed to toothy maws.</p>

    <p>A tool’s a tool. I don’t care if my axe is made of <br/> steel or bone; I care about its edge. Our people found gold and iron beneath the mountains. We seized that opportunity and we prospered. Now we’ve dug deeper, and found something new. You may see monsters and be broken by your terror—I see only opportunity, and I intend to take it.</p>
    <p>&#9;&#9;&#9; —Lord Halarak of Soldorakhold</p>
    <p>The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins—but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality—items such as the Alchemy Jug, Bag of Holding, or Decanter of Endless Water. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an Alchemy Keg that’s bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day—and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard Alchemy Jug. The Sol Udar Trinkets table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.</p>

    <p>Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures—Legendary magic items and Artifacts, things that can’t be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It’s common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner’s fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there’s no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don’t look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious Artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.</p>
    <p>While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure—symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a Hungry Axe (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven’t embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items dolaur—spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them dularash—foul blood—a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.</p>
    <p>Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a Cloak of Elvenkind, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun Rope of Climbing isn’t rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created Lighting Bugs—identical in function to Everbright Lanterns, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.</p>
    <p>Outsiders may be horrified by these living tools, but the motives of dwarves that use them are rational to many of their people. To many Mror, these items are trophies, concrete proof of Mror victories over the daelkyr: “If you took a magic axe from a fallen foe, you’d be a fool to throw it away. So what if it moans when it kills? It’s a powerful weapon, and it’s mine by right of conquest!” Many Mror also see carrying these tools as a sign of their courage, proudly demonstrating they aren’t afraid to put on living armor. They may bask in the fear that their treasures instill in their enemies. In addition, both Soldorak and Narathun are ambitious clans, and leaders hope that by unlocking the secrets of fleshcrafting, they can increase the power of their clans.</p>
    <p>Those clans that revile symbionts say that fleshcrafting is an abomination and an affront to Aureon and Onatar. The Narathun counter that Onatar is the master artisan and can work with any material; it is the doubters who insult Onatar by thinking his servants can’t master this new medium. This argument has found supporters in Clan Soranath; while the Soranath dwarves don’t fully embrace symbionts as the Soldorak and Narathun do, they are interested in the science of fleshcrafting and have been studying these techniques.</p>
    <p>The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth—can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.</p>
    <p>A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an Artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become Warlocks, typically using the Great Old One Patron. In creating a Mror Warlock, consider whether you’re bargaining with Dyrrn itself—are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you’re essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your “patron” could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your “patron,” you gain flashes of insight or information about them—attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop—that could drive your actions.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Ruling Clans</h3>

    <p>The Mror Holds are divided into twelve holds, each bearing the name of the ruling clan that exercises authority within that region. These twelve clans are the foundation of Mror culture, and every citizen owes allegiance to one of these clans. This section provides an overview of the twelve ruling clans, including their most remarkable mineral resources, their established feuds, and the virtues they assign to their mythic founder—and thus, the virtues they strive to embody. It’s worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun’s defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner Bards and Entertainers are found in every clan.</p>
    <p>While all Mror are bound to one of the ruling clans, there are many lesser clans, and below those, tenant families. In creating a Mror character, it’s up to you whether your character is tied directly to a ruling clan or if you’re part of a lesser family. While many Mror take inspiration from their ruling clan, they don’t all share the same virtues; in creating a Mror family of your own, you can decide what their celebrated virtues are.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Doldarun</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Silverblade Keep</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Iron, silver</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Kolkarun, Narathun, Soldorak</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Courage, honor, skill at arms. Resist corruption.</p>
    <p>The talespinners of Clan Doldarun say that their legendary founder was the child of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, and the dwarves of Doldarunhold take this to heart. Doldarun soldiers have always been among the best-trained and most disciplined warriors among the dwarves and they’re the most inclined to place their lives at risk for the good of all. There are countless tales of Doldarun facing terrifying monsters, fiends, and undead; if you need an exorcist in the Mror Holds, Doldarunhold is your best bet.</p>
    <p>Doldarun suffered heavy losses in the War Below; in part because it was the clan most determined to win the war instead of accepting the current stalemate, many Doldarun soldiers died in bold strikes against the foul enemy. The clan maintains a garrisoned colony below Silverblade Keep, and is building strength for a new offensive. In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold. Clan Doldarun has an ancient feud with Clan Soldorak, and denounced Narathun twenty years ago over Narathun fleshcrafting.</p>
    <p>Doldarun characters are likely to be Acolytes or Soldiers. This is an excellent clan for Clerics, Fighters, or Paladins—especially War Domain Clerics and Oath of Devotion Paladins. Rarely, perhaps once in a generation, the line of Doldarun produces dwarven Host aasimar. They attribute this to their mythical founder, child of the gods; chapter 3 has more information on playing Aasimar of non-human descent.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Droranath</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Stonespire</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Mercenaries, furs, meat</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Toldorath, Tordannon, the Jhorash’tar</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Strength, confidence. Embrace the wild.</p>
    <p>Doldarun is known for courage, while Droranath is fearless. What’s the difference? A talespinner says that Doldarun is afraid, but even knowing that fear, chooses to stand their ground; in contrast, Droranath never sees any reason to be afraid to begin with. Droranath dwarves value confidence and optimism, and are certain that their strength can carry them through any challenge.</p>
    <p>The Droranath dwarves value tradition, and their culture is the closest to the original Mror path before being conquered by Galifar. The Droranath never became miners; they are hunters, farmers, and above all, fierce warriors. Droranath youths have always trained with axe and hammer, long before Dol Udar made the practice common among the clans, and Hide Armor is standard fashion among the clan. Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called tra dolhass—the battle cry—a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The “Mror Howlers” are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors. They are one of the smallest and poorest clans, in part due to their violent lifestyle and refusal to embrace many modern advances, but they continue to hold their lands.</p>
    <p>Droranath has fought the Jhorash’tar orcs since the first days of exile. They accuse the orcs of countless atrocities, many of which may have indeed occurred—centuries in the past. Droranath talespinners insist the Jhorash’tar were responsible for the destruction of Noldrunhold, and now claim the orcs are in league with the horrors of the Realm Below. In addition to ongoing skirmishes between Droranath dwarves and the Jhorash’tar, this has led to a bitter feud between Droranath and the clans that support the Jhorash’tar—Toldorath and Tordannon.</p>
    <p>The Droranath dwarves aren’t miners, and they haven’t opened paths to the Realm Below in their territory. However, Droranath mercenaries have served other clans, and brought back trophies from their battles. It’s Droranath tradition to claim the arms and armor of fallen foes, and the Droranath have no qualms about using symbiont weapons, though they don’t celebrate them as Soldorak and Narathun do.</p>
    <p>Droranath characters are often Guides or Soldiers, as they are always willing to take risks to help friends. Rangers and Barbarians are sound choices for Droranath; Rangers are usually Hunters, while those who practice tra dolhass might be Path of the Berserker or Path of the World Tree Barbarians.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Kolkarun</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Lake Home</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Copper, silver</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Doldarun</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Diplomacy, flexibility, pragmatism. Never miss an opportunity.</p>
    <p>The Kolkarun dwarves aren’t the wealthiest clan, but they are skilled negotiators and are one of the more active clans in the wider world. Some Kolkarun dwarves believe that their mythic founder was Kol Korran, though they don’t like to brag about it. They’ve established strong ties to Aundair, Karrnath, Zilargo, and the Talenta Plains, and Kolkarun diplomats played a critical role in securing Karrnathi support for recognition of the Holds. Kolkarun has had many alliances and feuds over the centuries, but always manages to trick others into fighting its battles. Rivals say “Kolkarun’s mother was a gnome,” and assert that Kolkarun dwarves are cowards and opportunists. The Kolkarun shrug and respond, “Only a fool passes up an opportunity.” Currently, they have strong ties to Mroranon, which relies on their support in the Iron Council and makes use of Kolkarun as ambassadors and spies, and they have maintained strong ties to Soldorak since the Exile. Many of the most powerful members of the Aurum are Kolkarun dwarves.</p>
    <p>Kolkarun dwarves are the most adept sailors of the Mror. While they don’t focus their efforts on fishing, they have long been the primary sailors ferrying goods along Mirror Lake and facilitating trade and transit within the holds. However, House Lyrandar produces better ships than the Mror ever did, and today Kolkarun sailors are often licensed by Lyrandar.</p>
    <p>Kolkarun was quick to explore the Realm Below before the threat was known, but even they proved unable to negotiate with the horrors of the deep. Kolkarun holds a few outposts in Sol Udar—often with the help of Droranath mercenaries—but hasn’t made strong offensive moves in recent decades.</p>
    <p>Kolkarun dwarves are among those most likely to travel, and Kolkarun Entertainers, Sailors, and Merchants can be found across Khorvaire. Most of the Iron Council’s spies are Kolkarun; the Charlatan background works well for both a clever merchant and a freelance spy. Bard is a reasonable choice for a Kolkarun character, and they’re among the few dwarves with a true interest in lore.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clans Lanarak and Londurak</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Greenspire (Lanarak), Bounty (Londurak)</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Agriculture, fish, alcohol</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Each other</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Common sense, stoicism, enjoying life. Work hard and don’t complain.</p>
    <p>In the tales of the Exile, Lanarak and Londurak are siblings. Farmers and brewers, they’re all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they’re both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense—to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there’s a decent chance that if a bartender’s a dwarf, they’re from one of these two clans.</p>
    <p>While Lanarak and Londurak don’t mine metals, both traditionally farm mushrooms and red pudding in deep caverns, and both were drawn into the War Below. Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades—outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats. It’s rare for dwarves from these valley clans to take risks or to leave the holds, but a remarkable Guide or Sailor could hear the call of adventure.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Mroranon</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Krona Peak</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Iron, mithral</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Soldorak</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Charisma, leadership, wisdom. Lead the way, but lead wisely.</p>
    <p>Clan Mroranon has always been the largest and strongest of the ruling clans. The mythical Mroranon is said to have been the son of the last king of the Realm Below, and to have rallied the exiles to establish the Mror Holds. Talespinners say that it was Kol Korran’s bargain with Mroranon that ensured prosperity for the dwarves, and Krona Peak is home to both the Iron Council and Kol Korran’s Throne, the largest temple dedicated to the Sovereign in Khorvaire.</p>
    <p>While Mroranonhold has a wide variety of mines, it’s best known for iron and mithral. It has established strong ties with House Cannith, though all of the Five Nations import Mroranon steel. It has the strongest general industrial base of the holds, and Krona Peak is the largest single city in the region.</p>
    <p>Mroranon dwarves are proud of their skills as warriors and negotiators, even if they acknowledge Doldarun and Kolkarun to be the best in those fields. What sets the Mroranon apart is leadership. Mroranon sees the future and inspires others to follow. Mroranon unites, and makes wise decisions for the good of all. This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leader—Doldarun is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the Sovereign Host and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout Mror priests and powerful adepts hail from Mroranonhold.</p>
    <p>With the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon has the deepest investment in the Realm Below. It has multiple colony outposts, including one tied to a demiplane mine and another holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line while building power for another surge. Mroranon and its vassal clans have recovered many Legendary relics and Artifacts from the depths. While they don’t oppose symbionts as strongly as Doldarun, they refuse to make use of dularash items and assert that any contact with the daelkyr or their creations is dangerous.</p>
    <p>Acolyte, Noble, and Soldier are common backgrounds for Mroranon dwarves. While Paladins are more likely to be found in Doldarun, Clerics (especially the Trickery or Life Domain), Fighters, and Bards are all sound choices for Mroranon. With its big cities, it’s also a reasonable option for Criminals and Rogues.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Narathun</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Shadowspire</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Precious stones, wizardry</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Doldarun, Droranath, Toldorath, Tordannon</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Arcane knowledge, beauty, mystery. Solve mysteries, but remain unknown.</p>
    <p>Narathun is a small clan, but has always had power. The mythic hero Narathun was the lone wizard of the exiles, and their people hoarded this knowledge. Narathun was renowned for its magewrights, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies and sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry, secrets have always been one of Narathunhold’s primary exports. Narathun dwarves appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan is known for its artists and its bards; its work is unquestionably beautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans; it’s no accident that its largest city is called Shadowspire.</p>
    <p>In the modern age, the dragonmarked houses and traditions of Galifar have brought magewrights to all holds. But its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of Shadowspire is the one of the finest schools of divination in Khorvaire. Narathun sages have always asserted that no knowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds temples both to the Shadow and to the Blood of Vol. Clan Narathun is fascinated by the Realm Below, though it lacks the forces to push as deeply into Sol Udar as it would like, and Narathun patrons might well employ adventurers willing to risk their lives in the depths. Narathun artificers have embraced the study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for Mordain the Fleshweaver, they have made remarkable developments over the past few decades.</p>
    <p>Narathun dwarves hold long grudges. They have never forgiven Tordannon and Toldorath for thefts that occurred before Bal Dulor, and despise Droranath for a murder that occurred eight centuries ago. Doldarun has long condemned Narathun for its “foul practices,” and its pursuit of fleshcrafting has exacerbated this. However, the other clans value its jewels and its knowledge, and others have always stood in between Narathun and Doldarun. Soldorak and Narathun are staunch allies, reinforced by their interest in the Realm Below.</p>
    <p>A character from Narathun lends itself more to introspection than interaction and bargaining, and Narathun dwarves are more likely to be Artificers or Wizards than Warlocks. Narathun Entertainers and Bards produce haunting works; the College of Whispers (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) is an appropriate choice. This is also an excellent clan for Hermits, Acolytes, or Clerics tied to the Dark Six or the Blood of Vol. Despite the propaganda spread by Clan Doldarun, Narathun dwarves are no more likely to be evil than any others.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Soldorak</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Solangap</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Gold, platinum</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Doldarun, Mroranon</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Independence, cunning. Question authority and find your own path.</p>
    <p>In Dwarven, sol dorak means “defender of the realm.” While most Mror legends present the legendary Lord Mror as a wise and powerful leader, the talespinners of Solangap say that Lord Mror was an iron-handed tyrant—that the hero Soldorak challenged Mror for the good of the common people, and it was this that led to the Exile. In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.</p>
    <p>This principle is the cornerstone of the Soldorak character. “Power must be earned. The ends justify the means.” They believe the common concept of “honor” is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds. It was this principle that led clan nobles to found the Aurum, originally as a nexus for acts of rebellion against Galifar; today it continues to counterbalance the influence of foreign aristocrats and dragonmarked houses.</p>
    <p>Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of dolaur—symbionts—and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarven Artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That’s the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe—that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them—but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.</p>
    <p>While it’s home to Nobles and Soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of Charlatans and Criminals. It’s a haven for all manner of Rogues and Warlocks, especially Great Old One Patron Warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak Entertainer could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and Clerics and Acolytes are uncommon.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clan Soranath</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Blackhammer</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Artisans, Eberron dragonshards, manufactured goods</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> None</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Industry, innovation. There’s always a better way to do things.</p>
    <p>When the exiles were driven from the Realm Below, it was Soranath who made them weapons. Clan Soranath is one of the smallest clans, but its influence reflects the talents of its artisans. Other clans have mines and fields—it’s Soranath who takes what they produce and makes wonders.</p>
    <p>Not all artisans are from Soranath, just as not all of the denizens of Soranathhold are artisans. Most blades in Mroranonhold are forged by Mroranon smiths. But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won’t change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.</p>
    <p>Soranathhold is small, with only three spires. Its families are tightly knit, and the divide between tenant and clan is a thin line. Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn’t dependent on Tharashk, but doesn’t seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar Artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting. However, they are artisans, not warriors; they must hire others to venture into Sol Udar on their behalf.</p>
    <p>The Soranath dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, especially to Onatar; they are quick to assign credit for any great work to the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. There may also be a cult of the Traveler within Soranath, perhaps in Grayroot Spire; if so, it keeps its true devotion well hidden.</p>
    <p>Soranath dwarves are generally Artisans, Acolytes, or Sages. Artificers (primarily Battle Smiths) and Clerics of the Forge Domain (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) are both logical classes for Soranath dwarves.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Clans Toldorath and Tordannon</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Frosthaven</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Copper, medicinal supplies, livestock</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Droranath, Narathun</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Empathy, generosity, loyalty. Always willing to help a friend in need, and always willing to make a new friend.</p>
    <p>Like Lanarak and Londurak, the mythic founders of Clans Toldorath and Tordannon were siblings. Unlike their fellow exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both.</p>
    <p>Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.</p>
    <p>At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They’re stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans—to family, clan, and the holds themselves.</p>
    <p>But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash’tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy—the modern Jhorash’tar aren’t particularly adept healers—but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash’tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.</p>
    <p>Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have Soldiers and Fighters, Guides and Rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it’s always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">House Kundarak</h4>

    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Korunda Gate</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Resources:</strong> Gold, copper; dragonmarked services</p>
    <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> None</p>
    <p><strong>Celebrated Virtues:</strong> Insightful, perceptive, trustworthy. Offer sound advice and protect your friends from harm.</p>
    <p>The mythic founder of Clan Kundarak was a stonemason who built the first shelter for the exiles. While House Sivis estimates that Kundarak’s dragonmark appeared less than three thousand years ago, in the stories, Kundarak had always borne the mark and used its powers to protect their people. Dwarves of all clans relied on Kundarak, both for wise counsel and their expertise in building. Kundarak laid the foundations of the fortresses that stood against the armies of Galifar.</p>
    <p>But soon after Bal Dulor, Clan Kundarak became House Kundarak, expanding its influence across Khorvaire. While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans—House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak’s new role—though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.</p>
    <p>House Kundarak has no seat on the Iron Council and is not considered a Mror clan. Kundarak has done its best to stay out of the War Below, though Kundarak engineers played an important part in building defenses during the War Below, and were well paid for their services. Despite the lure of treasures and the mysteries of the past, Kundarak has no interest in courting disaster beneath the very seat of its power; it has fortified all deep portals beneath its spires. Should it choose to send expeditions below, it would do so with extreme care and caution.</p>
    <p>Ideas about building House Kundarak characters are presented in chapter 1 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Noldrunhold: The Lost Clan</h4>

    <p>There are twelve holds in the Mror Holds, including House Kundarak—but there were thirteen exiles in the stories. Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine—Korran’s Maw—was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.</p>
    <p>And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash’tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the Jhorash’tar could have achieved such a massacre.</p>
    <p>The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable. In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran’s Maw; others say the Jhorash’tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned—again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash’tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash’tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran’s Maw.</p>
    <p>Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below—that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that’s all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash’tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Jhorash&apos;tar Orcs</h4>

    <p>The Jhorash’tar are an alliance of orc tribes that have dwelt in the Ironroot Mountains since before the arrival of the dwarves. The Jhorash’tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror—a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror—implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash’tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.</p>
    <p>The Jhorash’tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains—often in caves along canyon walls—while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash’tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster—their spiritual leader—advises it.</p>
    <p>The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash’tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don’t create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a Cleric with the Grave Domain (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), though the typical bonecaster doesn’t have access to all the spells and features of a Cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be a World Tree or Zealot Barbarian. The Jhorash’tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.</p>
    <p>The Jhorash’tar don’t work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it’s also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor’s bone. The Jhorash’tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to Heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a Breastplate or Scale Mail.</p>
    <p>Many of the Jhorash’tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don’t want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn—but it’s possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.</p>
    <p>It’s up to the DM whether the Jhorash’tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash’tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Ruinbound Dwarves</h3>

    <p>The Doldarun dwarves say that any contact with the Realms Below corrupts the Mror. There’s one recent development that supports their argument—the occasional birth of ruinbound dwarves among the Mror clans. Ruinbound creatures are born with bizarre mutations and innate symbionts. To date, no one knows the origin or purpose—if any—of the ruinbound dwarves. Doldarun asserts that they are children corrupted by Dyrrn in the womb, tools of the daelkyr waiting to be activated. The sages of Clan Narathun say that they may indeed be the result of strange forces emanating from the Realm Below, but there’s no evidence that the children have any direct tie to the daelkyr or that they’re drawn to malefic actions. Regardless of the truth, ruinbound dwarves are a recent development. The first ruinbound children were born thirty years ago, and traditionally, dwarves aren’t even considered to be adults until their fiftieth year; however, ruinbound children mature surprisingly (some say unnaturally) quickly.</p>
    <p>Ruinbound dwarves are quite rare and can be born to dwarves of any bloodline. The Mror still don’t know what to make of them, though their attitude toward symbionts generally mirrors that toward ruinbound dwarves. The Doldarun dwarves are hostile to any ruinbounds that come to their land, and claim that ruinbound children are never born in their clan; while that’s a possibility, there are also rumors of Soldorak agents among the Doldarun that spirit away these infants to a clan that celebrates them, lest they meet a darker fate. The Droranath and Toldorath clans are curious, but they won’t necessarily ostracize ruinbound dwarves. Soldorak and Narathun families might embrace a ruinbound child—but they also might reject them out of fear that other clans could use them to paint the entire family as corrupted. In creating a Ruinbound character, you need to decide how you were received, reflected by your background. Are you a Wayfarer or a wandering Guide, having made your own way after being rejected by your family? Are you a Charlatan or a Criminal, forced down a dangerous path by the fears of those around you? Or might you be a Noble, treasured by your family despite—or because of—your condition?</p>
    <p>You can play a Ruinbound dwarf by building a character with the Ruinbound species presented in Chapter 6. As a Ruinbound dwarf, you could also choose to attribute your class abilities to your symbiont or your unnatural nature. As a Sorcerer, you could describe your spellcasting as being channeled through your symbiont or drawn from your other mutations. Any class with Unarmored Defense could present it as being tied to a physical mutation; if you’re a Barbarian, your Rage could manifest as an active transformation. If you’re a Ruinbound Warlock, you could say that your symbiont is your patron, an active sentience within you—and if you help it grow, it promises you greater powers.</p>
    <p>While others might fear them, ruinbound dwarves aren’t innately evil. In creating a Ruinbound character, talk with your DM about where you’d like your story to go. Do you want to be faced with the threat of corruption? Is it possible that Dyrrn does have plans for you? Or do you want to be a true hero despite your seemingly sinister features?</p>
    <p>The people of the Five Nations only think of the world in terms of the things they’ve seen, the lands they can visit. Forests and farmland, valleys and hills. But there’s another world a Brelish farmer can’t even imagine, a land of wonders a league below the water’s surface, lit by bioluminescence and cold fire. This is no empty wilderness. There are civilizations in the oceans, cultures older than even those of the giants of Xen’drik.</p>
    <p>Eberron is home to ten seas, as diverse as the continents of the world above. Each of the seas is home to powerful nations, deadly creatures, and hidden secrets. This section focuses on the Thunder Sea, beginning with an overview of the region and delving into the major cultures found there.</p>
    <p>In general, there’s little traffic between the people who dwell on land and those who live in the ocean depths. Just as a common Brelish farmer cares little about the ocean’s denizens, a typical merfolk kelp-tender knows nothing of Breland and has no interest in the surface dwellers. But anyone who sails the Thunder Sea needs to know what—and who—lies below. The nations of the depths maintain their borders like any other nation, and someone who blunders into the Eternal Dominion without proper authorization faces sahuagin wrath. Most major port cities—including Sharn and Stormreach—host representatives of nearby aquatic nations, and envoys on the docks can help plan and authorize travel through their domains. As a result, most sailors know at least a little about the cultures of the waters they pass through, and every Lyrandar crew includes a “sea speaker” who knows Sahuagin and Aquan.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Open Waters</h3>

    <p>The Thunder Sea lies between Khorvaire, Xen’drik, and Aerenal. It takes its name from the unnatural storms that rage over some areas, never-ending tempests fueled by the elemental power of Lamannia. As dangerous as these waters are, this is a crucial crossroads for trade, and there’s a constant stream of ships flowing between Sharn, Stormreach, and Pylas Talaer. It’s here that the sahuagin first arose, the seat of their greatest civilization.</p>
    <p>In the dawn of time, the Thunder Sea was the domain of the Lurker in Shadow. This overlord embodies the fear of the unknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and the fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us. The Lurker created the aboleths, who conquered and dominated creatures of the deep—giants, dragons, and sahuagin. The struggle against the overlords played out beneath the water just as it did above. Dragons battled krakens and giants fought aboleths, while the sahuagin consumed the fallen on both sides. The wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were impaled on spires of demonglass. But in time, the overlords were bound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.</p>
    <p>Today, the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are spread far and wide across the floor of the Thunder Sea. Their mightiest cities are built around—and into—massive slumbering creatures known as kar’lassa, “great dreamers.” The merfolk live in the upper waters above the sahuagin. Their permanent settlements are tied to manifest zones, and they perform rituals to contain the threat posed by these zones. The other major power in the Thunder Sea is the Valraean Protectorate, the domain of the sea elves. These elves laid claim to the waters around Aerenal, conquering the local sahuagin and other species, and bending them to their will. The Dominion sahuagin despise the Valraean elves, but thus far, the power of the Undying Court has repelled every assault.</p>
    <p>What will bring your adventurers to the Thunder Sea? Will you delve into the depths to explore ruins built by long-dead giants? Will you negotiate with sahuagin and work to prevent a war between land and sea? Or will you struggle to survive after you’re pulled down by the aboleths and the ancient evils that lurk in the ultimate darkness?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Ports and Travel</h4>

    <p>The Thunder Sea is a critical path for trade. Any traffic with Xen’drik crosses the Thunder Sea. In addition to the ships of House Lyrandar (both elemental galleons with dragonmarked captains and mundane ships licensed by the house), the Thunder Sea sees traffic from Aerenal, Zilargo, Breland, and Riedra. The most important ports include Pylas Maradal (Valenar), Pylas Talaer (Aerenal), Sharn (Breland), Stormreach (Xen’drik), Trolanport (Zilargo), Wyvernskull (Darguun), and Zarash’ak (Shadow Marches).</p>
    <p>These major ports see both commercial, diplomatic, and military traffic. Aereni merchants carry shipments of exotic lumber, Riedran vessels are laden with crysteel and dragonshards, Lyrandar ships carry all manner of trade goods, and smugglers sneak barrels of kuryeva and tilxin blood into hidden coves. While the standard map of Khorvaire focuses on these major ports, there are also countless smaller ports and fishing villages scattered along the coastline.</p>
    <p>The masters of the Thunder Sea—the sahuagin—don’t want dryskins blundering through their territory. Traveling directly along the coastline is reasonably safe, and local fisherfolk don’t need to negotiate with sahuagin every time they set sail; the sahuagin don’t lay claim to the waters within 6 miles of Khorvaire’s coast, and permit fishing an additional 20 miles beyond that. But crossing the Thunder Sea is an entirely different story. Setting aside the territorial claims of the sahuagin, the sea is filled with deadly hazards—endless storms, demonglass spires, and hungry monstrosities.</p>
    <p>The Eternal Dominion has established specific routes that captains must follow, safe from hazards and monitored by the Dominion. Captains who wish to use these routes must obtain Beacons of Passage—Common magic items that tell the sahuagin their travel is authorized, charged to last for a set time. Even with a beacon, there are places—such as Shargon’s Teeth—where a wise captain pays for the services of a sahuagin or merfolk guide.</p>
    <p>Some brave (or foolish) souls deviate from these approved routes, whether desiring speed or avoiding the cost of local customs and the price of a Beacon of Passage. The Thunder Sea is nearly the size of Khorvaire itself, and the sahuagin aren’t everywhere; however, those regions shunned by the sahuagin and merfolk are usually avoided with good reason, and smugglers may face dangerous environmental hazards or hungry monstrosities.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Power of Lamannia</h4>

    <p>The storms of the Thunder Sea are legendary. Beyond wind and rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the largest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the water to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats, even more so because these dangers don’t obey simple laws of wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range of manifest zones, but the most powerful and numerous are those tied to Lamannia. The endless fury of the First Storm lashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great maelstroms can pull a ship down into the Endless Ocean. The vast masses of vegetation are tied to the Twilight Forest, fueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap it in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is most strongly felt here, it’s also possible to find an unexpected region of icebergs surrounding a manifest zone tied to Risia, boiling waters around a Fernian zone, or a region tied to Mabar where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.</p>
    <p>As any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, manifest zones are stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone’s influence extends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder Sea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the plane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is dramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their usual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why knowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you venture off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a course that will avoid the storms.</p>
    <p>Lamannian manifest zones often release elementals into Eberron. An eternal storm may contain air elementals, while water elementals can be found in the region around a maelstrom. Such elementals aren’t intentionally cruel, but they’re driven to express their elemental drives—which often makes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien invaders. Manifest zones can also produce dire beasts—octopi, sharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.</p>
    <p>The merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed in more detail later in this section) serve as planar shepherds, tending manifest zones and helping to contain and mitigate their effects. This isn’t absolute; the merfolk can’t entirely disperse the power of the First Storm, or stop the growth of the Twilight Forest. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone, those storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped performing their rituals or were driven away entirely.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Teeth</h4>

    <p>Throughout the sea, vast spires of stone and coral rise up from the bottom of the ocean—in some cases, over a mile in height. Some reach the surface, while other clusters lie hundreds of feet below it. While these spires formed naturally, they’re often interspersed with a more dangerous—and unnatural—substance. Demonglass is similar to obsidian, but virtually indestructible. These demonglass spires—commonly called “needle teeth”—can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship despite being just a few inches in width. The spires in this region were created by the Lurker in Shadow during the First War (though it wasn’t responsible for the demonglass found elsewhere in Eberron, such as Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes).</p>
    <p>The region known as Shargon’s Teeth—a Common adaptation of the Sahuagin name for the Devourer—lies directly between Sharn and Stormreach, and is the most infamous manifestation of these hazardous needle teeth. Stone spires and demonglass spikes of all sizes are scattered between this chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.</p>
    <p>Throughout the Thunder Sea, needle teeth are a dangerous hazard for those who stray from the established trade routes—but they also provide an opportunity to interact with creatures of the sea. Any number of aquatic monstrosities may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The sahuagin also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire. High teeth thus serve as outposts projecting up to the upper waters where light can reach, allowing travelers to visit a sahuagin outpost without having to descend to the absolute depths.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Kar&apos;lassa: The Great Dreamers</h4>

    <p>The greatest wonders of the Thunder Sea lie deep below the surface, all but unknown to the people of Khorvaire. The kar’lassa are enormous beasts—miles in length—half-buried and sleeping within the floor of the Thunder Sea. Not even the dragons of Argonnessen know the origin of the kar’lassa. They’ve slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could’ve been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.</p>
    <p>All that’s known for certain is that the kar’lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar’lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar’lassa reflects the plane they’re tied to; the kar’lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar’lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar’lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar’lassa dream, they don’t dream in Dal Quor. Instead, each kar’lassa dreams in the plane it’s tied to—and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar’lassa—including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes—is pulled into the behemoth’s dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal’iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn’t hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still dreaming; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the Uul’kur in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.</p>
    <p>Twelve kar’lassa have been discovered; one for each plane, aside from Dal Quor. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion have built their largest cities around eight of these great dreamers, though they’ve shunned the kar’lassa associated with Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the kar’lassa, and these substances are the fuel that drives their industry.</p>
    <p>The kar’lassa are a source of wonder, not monsters to be fought. To all tests, they appear to be immortal, and regenerate damage quickly. Spells such as Flesh to Stone or Disintegrate only work on a tiny sliver of the kar’lassa, and even that’s quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.</p>
    <p>Titanic, unstoppable monstrosities that could threaten entire cities? That sounds a little like the tarrasque. And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar’lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar’lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it’s possible a small kar’lassa might be the first to wake—can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they’ll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar’lassa. If they’re the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they’re tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Haunted Ruins and the Deepest Darkness</h4>

    <p>The Thunder Sea is vast and ancient. The sahuagin call their civilization the Eternal Dominion, but in truth, it’s risen and fallen multiple times. The Lurker, as well, has nearly risen several times, and aboleths have set the sea devils against one another in vicious civil wars. There are a handful of storm giants in the depths, but any nation they once possessed was destroyed long ago. Remnants of these conflicts are spread across the Thunder Sea. Explorers could find an ancient temple haunted by the ghosts of the storm giants that built it, an overgrown sahuagin fortress from a previous age of the Dominion, or the tomb of a dragon sealed tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
    <p>Most dangerous of all are the deepest abysses, strongholds of the surviving servants of the Lurker in Shadow. These cracks in the ocean floor might hold mighty Artifacts forged during the Age of Demons, but they’re home to aboleths, fiends, and even more terrifying creatures.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">What Roams the Sea?</h4>

    <p>When dealing with the Thunder Sea, remember that it’s just as civilized as the Five Nations. It does have wilderness regions with feral beasts roaming at will, and you might find wild plesiosaurs, a scheming sea hag, or a hungry scrag. But in the areas above and around sahuagin city-states, such beasts have been tamed or destroyed. All cultures of the Thunder Sea farm fish like the people of the land farm sheep or cattle; a pod of whales may be carefully managed and cultivated, and their farmers will be quite angry with dryskins who poach their ichthyic livestock. There are sharks—and giant sharks—in the wild waters, but in the civilized zones, the sahuagin use them much as humans use hounds. Dragon turtles serve different roles depending where they’re found; in the Dominion, dragon turtles are forced to serve as beasts of burden and living engines of war, while the merfolk form alliances with dragon turtles and consider them partners in a community.</p>
    <p>Later sections explore the relationships between the major cultures of the Thunder Sea. Here’s general information about other sentient aquatic creatures in the region:</p>
    <p>Locathah are subjects of both the Valraean Protectorate and the eastern regions of the Eternal Dominion. The locathah never had a civilization as advanced as the sahuagin, and have been subjects of the Dominion for thousands of years. However, there could be bands of free locathah on the edges of the Dominion, potentially hiding in the territorial waters of Khorvaire.</p>
    <p>Storm giants once had a presence along the coastline of Xen’drik. After devastating conflicts with several sahuagin nations, they were all but wiped out. Today, they’re generally known only through the ruins and tombs they left behind, usually protected by powerful magic and left alone by the Eternal Dominion. There are still a few storm giants in hiding; most are shadows of their former glory, but there may still be a few hidden giants who have preserved their powers.</p>
    <p>Dragons have much the same relationship with the Thunder Sea that they have with Khorvaire. There are a few rogue dragons (black, bronze, green, or gold) who pursue their goals in isolated regions of the Thunder Sea. Elsewhere, the Chamber monitors the Dominion just as it watches humanity, intervening only if its interests are threatened.</p>
    <p>Kuo-toa have no significant presence in the Thunder Sea, though they are found elsewhere in Eberron.</p>
    <p>Koalinth were developed by the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan to defend the coastline, though the dar never sought to cross the sea. These aquatic hobgoblins were exterminated by the sahuagin following the collapse of the empire, though koalinth tribes are occasionally discovered in remote locations. It’s possible a more sophisticated clan of koalinth went into deep seclusion at the same time as other Kech Dhakaan; if so, this could be an ally for the Heirs of Dhakaan.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Random Discoveries</h4>

    <p>What might a vessel find if it leaves the sanctioned trade routes and ventures into forbidden territories? The Thunder Sea Surprises table provides a few possibilities.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Eternal Dominion: Sahuagin</h3>

    <p>Any sailor in Stormreach can tell you that the sahuagin worship the Devourer, who they call Shargon. But this is only part of the story. Sahuagin storm priests tell the common tale of how gods and demons fought in the first age, but their story doesn’t end with the binding of the overlords. Once the fiends were defeated, the Sovereigns were determined to take their place and rule as tyrants. The sahuagin Sha’argon was a bold hunter and mighty warrior. He stalked the Sovereigns of the natural world, Arra’ai and Ba’alor. Sha’argon trapped them and consumed them, claiming their power as his own. The other Sovereigns were angry, but none could outwit Sha’argon, and he already had the power of two gods; so they fled to the world above and beyond, and to this day, they flee when the mighty hunter draws near.</p>
    <p>Sha’argon is the greatest of the gods. He sets the laws of the world, and they are cruel. Life is an endless struggle. The weak will perish in the storm or be consumed by the mighty. Those with cunning and courage can conquer the world itself, and the victor has the right to devour their vanquished foe. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion take these messages to heart. There is no foe they cannot conquer, no power they cannot claim. They have forged a dominion from the bones of krakens and the blood of the kar’lassa, an empire that will never end.</p>
    <p>If the Dominion wished to conquer the surface world, it could do so easily—or so the sahuagin say. But to what end? Dryskins are pathetic barbarians, weak in both body and mind. The Eternal Dominion seeks grander prey, power worthy of Sha’argon. Some seek to consume the overlords; others plan the conquest of worlds beyond the world. Is this pure arrogance? Or can the Eternal Dominion gain mastery over reality itself?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Biology</h4>

    <p>The sahuagin dwell on the floor of the Thunder Sea. They possess an uncanny ability to rapidly adapt to changing pressure, and can ascend from the depths to the surface with no ill effects. Darkvision allows them to see even in the blackest depths of the ocean, though they require at least a little light to function at full efficiency. Their skin is as tough as Leather Armor, and their claws and teeth are deadly weapons.</p>
    <p>Human scholars are aware of the existence of sahuagin “mutants,” but few realize these aren’t random mutations; they’re the most visible products of a system that touches every sahuagin in the Dominion. From the moment they emerge from the spawning pools, young sahuagin undergo a regimen of diet, mystic rituals, and training that shapes them for their intended purpose. Sahuagin aren’t clones, but a sahuagin warrior is imbued with strength and fury, and a sahuagin assassin is swift and deadly—each by design. The sahuagin create their sorcerers. All Dominion sahuagin go through this initial process of shaping, and those who prove themselves worthy can go farther still, undergoing the rituals that produce champions such as the four-armed barons and the malenti. But these are just two examples of what the sahuagin magebreeders can achieve. The Claws of Sha’argon—presented in chapter 8—are another example of these magebred champions.</p>
    <p>What do sahuagin eat? Whatever they want, and often, whoever they want. Sahuagin are voracious omnivores who demonstrate their mastery over things by consuming them. Food brings great pleasure to the sahuagin, and they take pride both in the preparation of food and in the diversity of their diet; they farm both fish and flora, and hunt creatures that can’t be farmed. Eating a locathah servant can either be an act of punishment or a great honor, depending on how the meal is prepared and consumed. Like the gnolls of the Znir Pact, it’s common for a sahuagin to eat at least part of a fallen enemy, though this is more to seal the victory than to honor the spirit; you haven’t truly defeated someone until you’ve consumed them. With this concept in mind, a DM may wish to give sahuagin NPCs Advantage on saving throws against any sort of ingested poison and Resistance to Poison damage from such poisons.</p>
    <p>Fiendish Sahuagin?</p>
    <p>The 2025 Monster Manual classifies sahuagin as Fiends. However, the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion aren’t fiends; they can use the stat blocks of the 2025 Monster Manual, but they should have the Humanoid creature type, not Fiend. The Lurker in Shadows has created its own foul servants in a mockery of the sahuagin form, immortal creatures driven purely by bloodlust and a desire to spread terror. These use the Sahuagin stat blocks from the 2025 Monster Manual, including the Fiend creature type. But they aren’t sahuagin. They are more monstrous in their form—feral caricatures of the true sahuagin—and are called Sea Devils within the setting.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Victory Above All</h4>

    <p><strong>Life is conflict.</strong> All things must eat or be eaten. Flee if victory is impossible in the moment, but never surrender.</p>
    <p>Sahuagin culture is deeply aggressive; in any situation, they look to see how they can win. This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn’t that I defeat the foe, it’s that we defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don’t seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don’t deserve. Similarly, weakness can’t be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them—but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they’re challenged. It’s common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you. On the other hand, those seen as having no value—who are best excised from the Dominion—will simply be fed to the sharks.</p>
    <p>Stemming from this, the people of the Eternal Dominion are extremely industrious. Sahuagin never relax, and don’t understand why anyone would—if you stop moving, you’re dead. They’re always looking for something to do, a challenge to overcome. However, this leaves them little time for abstract reflection, romance, or whimsy; life is war, and there’s no time for poetry. Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don’t seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn’t to say the sahuagin don’t enjoy life or seek entertainment—but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don’t care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they’re eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture. Their armor, weapons, and architecture are designed to intimidate enemies and show off one’s rank and status.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Social Structure</h4>

    <p>Sahuagin have no families nor concept of personal property. Your loyalty is to your city, and then to the Dominion as a whole. You were born in the spawning pools of your city and assigned a purpose and a shiver—the group of sahuagin you trained with as a child, to whom you may have a personal attachment. From there, you worked your way up to prove your value and earn a higher rank. All positions are based on merit; while the title of a military leader is often translated as “baron,” the position is earned, not inherited. The city gives you equipment and lodging based on your position, though you can earn trophy items through sporting victories. Sahuagin always look for ways to prove themselves and earn advancement, but never at the expense of your shiver, your city, or the Dominion. Sahuagin find criminal behavior and those who betray their people for personal gain to be repulsive, a sign of an inferior species.</p>
    <p>The society of the Eternal Dominion is split into three primary forces:</p>
    <p>The Ra’har (“body”) is the military. The sahuagin view life as conflict, and are zealous about maintaining a strong military. When there is no active conflict, they engage in war games and gladiatorial combat—both locally, and in a league against the other cities—to entertain the people.</p>
    <p>The Ta’har (“mind”) are the scholars, scientists, and priests—which, among the sahuagin, are all branches of a single path. Alchemy and sorcery are core sciences in the Dominion. The sahuagin recognize divine magic as a resource, and excel at the aggressive cultivation of the faith required to channel it. Ta’har scholars advise the Ra’har, using the lessons of history to drive military strategy, while Ta’har artificers work with the Su’har to maintain the infrastructure of the cities.</p>
    <p>The Su’har (“heart”) are responsible for the civic infrastructure. They maintain and expand the cities, ensure the steady flow of supplies, and organize the spawning pools and the education and evolution of the young. The Ta’har develop new techniques, but it’s the Su’har who turn the wheels of industry.</p>
    <p>Each city is governed by a Sha’rei—Council of Three—with a leader from each force. Councilors add the prefix “kar” to their force, so the Kar’ra’har is the military leader of a sahuagin city. Cities coordinate through the Sha’lassa—Council of Dreams—as described in the “Harvesting the Dreamers” section of this chapter.</p>
    <p>The priesthood of the Eternal Dominion follows one of two paths. The razh’ash—storm priests—are devoted to Sha’argon, and serve as the primary spiritual guides of the people. They teach the harsh lessons of the Devourer, while also wielding his might in battle when needed. The second path is that of the lass’ash, “dream priests”; their work is important and they support the Su’har, but they don’t preach to the people.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Territory</h4>

    <p>The Eternal Dominion claims the entirety of the Thunder Sea as its territory, and maintains outposts across the sea, often carved into stone spires that rise up to the surface. However, most of their population is concentrated in the great cities of the Dominion. These lie on the seafloor, thousands of feet below the surface, far beyond the reach of sunlight—yet illuminated by sahuagin-engineered bioluminescent coral. Each city is named after the kar’lassa it’s built around, and the kar’lassa in turn are named for the plane they’re bound to.</p>
    <p>Hal’daan (Daanvi). The city of Hal’daan is the administrative heart of the Dominion. Here, the leaders of the Su’har develop the civic models used throughout the Dominion. This city also holds the bureaucratic archives of the Dominion.</p>
    <p>Hal’dol (Dolurrh). The smallest of the great cities, Hal’dol is a center for necromantic research. The skulls of great leaders and priests from across the Dominion are preserved in the Bone Library, where sahuagin mediums can use Speak with Dead to consult with them.</p>
    <p>Hal’fer (Fernia). This region has an abundance of geothermal vents, and due to Fernia’s influence, it’s also a source of pure elemental flame that burns underwater. Hal’fer is an industrial center working with heat and steam; it’s the primary source of metal goods, and mints the currency used with surface dwellers.</p>
    <p>Hal’iri (Irian). This is a stronghold of the Ta’har, driving mystical research and holding the largest temples in the Dominion—both in reality and in the kar’lassa’s dream. Many priests train in Hal’iri, and its people have grand dreams of what the Dominion can become. It’s a center for exploring lofty goals, such as defeating the Valraean Protectorate, consuming the overlords to gain their power, and perhaps even conquering the planes (as discussed in the “Story Hooks” section of this chapter).</p>
    <p>Hal’kyth (Kythri). The influence of Kythri supports magic tied to change and transmutation, and these are vital to the society of the Dominion. Hal’kyth is the heart of the alchemical industry. While all great cities harvest the blood of the kar’lassa (as discussed in the next section), it is Hal’kyth that has the greatest capacity for refining it. Though the Dominion is slow to innovate, the artificers of Hal’kyth are an exception, and they continue to develop new techniques; the plasmids discussed in chapter 8 were first magebred in Hal’kyth.</p>
    <p>Hal’laman (Lamannia). The flora and fauna of this region are unnaturally fertile. Hal’laman is a center for all forms of animal husbandry, and also holds the largest spawning pools of the Dominion. When Lamannia is coterminous, growth rates spike dramatically; it’s always a struggle to keep the city safe during these times, with aggressive beasts swept into frenzies and vegetation becoming shambling mounds.</p>
    <p>Hal’shavar (Shavarath). This is the military seat of the Dominion, where the finest barons and strategists are trained. Here, the Ra’har of Hal’shavar establish the military traditions used throughout the Dominion. Mock battles and other grand spectacles are carried out in the grand arena of Hal’shavar.</p>
    <p>Hal’syra (Syrania). This is the center for commerce and trade with other cultures. Hal’syra even has a rarely-used quadrant enchanted so surface dwellers can breathe within it. This city is the source of the ambassadors, envoys, and merchants who deal with surface dwellers and other cultures, and it’s here that the scholars of the Ta’har study surface dwellers and debate the best ways to deal with them.</p>
    <p>These major cities are each home to hundreds of thousands of sahuagin, and the total population of the Dominion is well into the millions. Farms and other small communities scattered between the great cities are often largely inhabited by locathah, with a core group of sahuagin overlords. In between, there are large stretches with no humanoid population; here, ruins of the giants and remnants of other fallen civilizations might be found.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Harvesting the Dreamers</h4>

    <p>The eight greatest cities of the Eternal Dominion are built around kar’lassa, each tied to a different plane. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the slumbering behemoths, and this is the driving fuel of the Eternal Dominion. Pipelines channel the blood of the beasts, and workers dig muscle and bone out of mines carved into their flesh. The eldritch energies sustaining the kar’lassa regenerate damage at a remarkable rate; the Dominion has been harvesting them for over a thousand years, and so far, they haven’t come close to taxing these resources.</p>
    <p>All biomatter from the kar’lassa is infused with arcane energy, and the sahuagin use these substances in the same way the Five Nations rely on dragonshards. In addition, the biomatter of each kar’lassa has unique properties and potential due to the plane it’s tied to. The scales of Hal’shavar can be forged into powerful armor and weapons. The steam-breath of Hal’fer is an extremely powerful catalyst for evocation magic. The blood of Hal’kyth is an exceptional conduit for transmutation. These are just a few examples of the potential of the kar’lassa, and the Dominion itself is still discovering new uses for these resources. The Five Nations have never had an opportunity to work with this biomatter and know nothing of the kar’lassa. If a group of adventurers recovered a significant amount of biomatter—or secured a trade deal with the Dominion—House Cannith could produce strange new wonders.</p>
    <p>So the kar’lassa are priceless resources and sources of power for the sahuagin; their biomatter drives Dominion industry, and cities benefit from the effects of their manifest zones. Only eight of the twelve kar’lassa have cities built around them, due to the dangers of the manifest zones extending from the kar’lassa tied to Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. But even in the cities of the “safer” kar’lassa, the sahuagin pay a price for the power they’ve harnessed. When the people of these cities sleep, their spirits are drawn into the dream of the local kar’lassa—a vast alien dream that takes place in its bound plane, rather than Dal Quor. Most sahuagin aren’t lucid dreamers, and don’t remember their dreams with any more accuracy than most humans do. But this experience has a notable impact on the personality and aptitudes of the people of each city; the people of Hal’shavar are the most aggressive of the sahuagin, while the people of Hal’syra are the most conciliatory.</p>
    <p>The lass’ash—the “dream priests”—are an arm of the Ta’har devoted to the kar’lassa of their cities. These priests treat the kar’lassa both as divine beings and as servants; they believe that it’s their rituals and devotions that keep the dreamers safely asleep, allowing the Dominion to continue to harvest their biomatter. At the heart of each temple lies the Or’lassa, the First Dreamer—a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar’lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar’lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar’lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar’lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it’s in the dream of Hal’iri that the spirits of the Or’lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the Sha’lassa, the Council of Dreams.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tools and Traditions</h4>

    <p>The Eternal Dominion is an advanced civilization that employs both arcane and divine magic as part of everyday life. It’s generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate Continual Flame, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic—generally influenced by the resources of that city’s kar’lassa—the Dominion’s greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.</p>
    <p>The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn’t quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar’lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, “If you consume a thing you gain its power.” As a result, creating a sorcerer that wields Draconic Sorcery requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon—so there’s a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.</p>
    <p>In addition to these basic techniques that guide the evolution of a young sahuagin, the Dominion can also induce dramatic secondary mutations; many sahuagin are highly motivated by this prospect of attaining a higher form. The malenti and the four-armed barons are the best known of these, but they represent just a fraction of the Dominion’s magebreeding abilities, and the DM can create additional mutants to suit the story. For example, the Sahuagin Claw of Sha’argon (presented in chapter 8) possesses a secondary mutation that’s granted to powerful priests. These forms of ascension require rare resources and a significant amount of kar’lassa blood (drawn from a particular dreamer based on the type of transformation sought), and are only granted to sahuagin who prove themselves worthy.</p>
    <p>In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a Swim Speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast’s hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with Siege Staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal’kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar’lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards—often serving as living doors to secure chambers—but they’re also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.</p>
    <p>Skilled Dominion magewrights can cast Fabricate as a Ritual, shaping raw materials into their desired form through magic. The Dominion also uses a substance called korlass (“dream stone”), formed from dreamer biomass, as an industrial material; it can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a magewright ritual. Korlass has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which kar’lassa it’s drawn from.</p>
    <p>When considering the abilities of Dominion sahuagin, it’s likely that storm priests are Tempest Domain Clerics (from the 2014 Player’s Handbook) or Oath of Conquest Paladins (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), while dream priests are Life Clerics. Sahuagin Artificers are usually Alchemists, and the most common forms of arcane spellcasters are Sorcerers (either Storm Sorcery or Draconic Sorcery) and Magewrights. Sahuagin warriors are typically Battle Master or Champion Fighters, but some embrace the blood frenzy of Barbarians. Bards, Druids, Wizards, and Warlocks aren’t supported by the traditions of the Dominion and are rarely encountered.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Subject Species</h4>

    <p>“Dominion” isn’t just a title; the sahuagin dominate other creatures, from other aquatic humanoids to mighty dragon turtles. Before the rise of the Eternal Dominion, there were six locathah nations spread across the Thunder Sea; in the last thousand years, these have all been conquered and assimilated by the Dominion. Locathah laborers are now found in all of the great cities, and there are farming communities across the seafloor where locathah are ruled by sahuagin overseers.</p>
    <p>The locathah are the most widespread subjects of the Dominion, but other creatures have been forced into servitude as well. The sahuagin of Hal’laman may have merfolk subjects. There could be a small population of subjugated koalinth near the coast of Darguun, or a city where there are still a few storm giants compelled into service. Typically, creatures that are Dominion subjects know the Sahuagin language, either instead of Common, or in addition to it (if they have regular contact with dryskins).</p>
    <p>The Kalamer merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed later in this section) have largely been allowed to remain independent, as long as they continue to serve the needs of the Dominion. The Kalamer provide a valuable service, containing the impact of dangerous manifest zones and serving as intermediaries between the Dominion and the Valraean Protectorate.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Foreign Relations</h4>

    <p>The people of the Five Nations know little about the Eternal Dominion. Ambassadors and envoys have visited Hal’syra, so there are stories drifting around that the sahuagin city is built around a massive, mysterious creature. This experience and the occasional clashes when people have challenged the territorial demands of the Dominion have taught the Five Nations and the houses to respect the Dominion, but they still know almost nothing about it, aside from the fact that they worship the Devourer. The Aereni have greater knowledge of the Dominion, and have seen its power in the long conflict with the Valraean Protectorate. They know about the kar’lassa, but because of the ongoing conflict, haven’t actually explored its lands or visited its cities. So any adventurers who venture into the Dominion are pioneers, exploring unknown realms; academic institutions and dragonmarked houses alike will surely want to hear about their exploits.</p>
    <p>For their part, the sahuagin have little interest in the affairs of the dryskins. At this time, the Dominion has no interest in conquering the surface world, and they don’t believe the dryskins pose any threat to their rule of the sea. However, the proud sahuagin don’t want surface-dwellers bumbling through their territory or polluting their waters. They enforce their territorial waters as a show of strength, demanding that travelers pay tolls and follow the established trade routes.</p>
    <p>The Dominion remained neutral in the Last War. Trade between the sea and the surface has been limited, but has expanded in recent years. In particular, Merrix d’Cannith has discovered that the sahuagin have a surplus of Siberys shards; the shards fall into the ocean, but the Dominion economy is based on the blood of the kar’lassa as opposed to dragonshards, and they have little use for them. As such, the Dominion has much to offer Cannith, and securing a steady supply of Siberys shards would strengthen Merrix’s position within his house. The trick is finding something the Dominion wants in return, and he’s currently pursuing this. Merrix (and other dryskins) are as yet unaware of the vast resources of the kar’lassa; if they were discovered, and Cannith found a way to harness them, it could change the face of industry in Khorvaire.</p>
    <p>The Dominion despises the sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate, and in the past, they’ve launched full-scale campaigns against them, but the power of the Undying Court has thus far repelled all assaults. Currently, it’s a stalemate; the Protectorate can’t expand beyond the Undying Court’s sphere of influence (as discussed later in this section), and the Dominion can’t drive them back.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sahuagin and Malenti Adventurers</h4>

    <p>The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion aren’t driven by the desire for gold that draws many humans to the path of adventure. Most are fiercely devoted to the Dominion—but what if your duty to the Dominion requires you to venture onto dry land? Perhaps you need to negotiate with the dryskins. Maybe you’re seeking information on a force that’s meddling with the Dominion—is it House Cannith or the Lords of Dust? Perhaps you’re pursuing your peoples’ goal of consuming an overlord or conquering the planes. Maybe you’ve been sent to study the dryskins themselves, to decide whether they’re worth conquering. Or you might just be an exile or a rebel, a rare outlier who opposes the ambitions and actions of your people.</p>
    <p>This book presents two options for sahuagin characters. The first is to use the Sahuagin species from Chapter 6. However, this poses significant challenges. The first is that you’re an alien, a creature with a face few recognize, and that those who do typically view you with fear. The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both Sahuagin and Locathah—a need for regular immersion in water—can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never seen a sahuagin, that doesn’t mean they’ve never met one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren’t born, they’re made. One of the sacred rituals of Sha’argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid—and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin becomes that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about sea elf malenti, as they’ve been caught and exposed in the Dominion’s long war with the Protectorate. But unbeknownst to the Five Nations, there are human malenti in Sharn, dwarf malenti in Stormreach, malenti passing as many species and traveling the surface wherever the Dominion needs eyes and hands.</p>
    <p>Chapter 6 provides the Malenti background that can be combined with any species. Using this background, you can secretly play a sahuagin who’s assumed the identity of the person they appear to be. While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti just replace people who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who stray into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn’t to take advantage of the character’s previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention. If you want to play a Malenti without taking this background, with your DM’s approval you can substitute the Aquatic Adaptation feat in Chapter 6 with the Origin feat normally granted by your background; it’s the Aquatic Adaptation feat that marks you as a Malenti, able to breathe underwater.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Playing a Malenti</h4>

    <p>As a Malenti character, you were born a sahuagin in the Eternal Dominion of the Thunder Sea, but ritual magic and the blood of the kar’lassa allowed you to consume and replace a surface dweller. You can never regain your original form; for all intents and purposes, you are who you appear to be. You’re physically indistinguishable from this original victim, and you have enough of their memories to fool even their family and friends. But you have the mind of a sahuagin, and you’re loyal to the Dominion.</p>
    <p>As a Malenti, the first question is why the Dominion chose to replace this particular person, and how your mission relates to your activities as an adventurer. It’s possible that your only mission is to observe the dryskins and occasionally provide information to a sahuagin spymaster, or you might have a specific goal that drives your actions during your adventures. The Suggested Characteristics tables provide information about your mission.</p>
    <p>You’re physically identical to the creature you appear to be; you are an Elf, or a Kalashtar, or whatever species you replaced. It is up to you and your DM to decide how widespread malenti are in Khorvaire. It could be that the Dominion has placed many malenti in the Five Nations, or you might be one of the first. If this is the case, you may be the first malenti to duplicate a creature of this particular species. This could be particularly interesting with a Kalashtar—you’ve inherited the spiritual bond with a quori, but what does that mean for you? Will the tie to the alien spirit change you? Similarly, if you possess a dragonmark, it seems to function normally, but will there be strange consequences in your future?</p>
    <p>It’s possible that your abilities reflect additional Dominion magebreeding or skills from your sahuagin side. If you’re a Barbarian, does your Rage reflect the blood frenzy of the sahuagin? If you’re a Sorcerer, is spellcasting a gift your victim already possessed, or is it the result of sahuagin modification? And how has the integration of the new personality affected you? Are you still a true sahuagin, devoted to the Dominion? Or are the victim’s memories and experiences causing you to question your mission?</p>
    <p><strong>Tour of Duty.</strong> As a Malenti, you’ve stolen the identity of a surface dweller. But when did this occur? How long have you been playing this role, and how comfortable are you with it?</p>

    <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics.</strong> Malenti are deep cover spies. Becoming a malenti means sacrificing the sahuagin world you’ve known your whole life; it requires strong will and devotion. But malenti are a blend of sahuagin spy and the person they appear to be; they still have the memories and the mannerisms of the victim, and this can cause the sahuagin personality to erode or evolve.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Story Hooks</h4>

    <p>The Eternal Dominion has no interest in conquering Khorvaire—at least for now. But the sahuagin believe life is conflict, and if you aren’t moving forward, you’ll wither away. This section contains story hooks and major aspirations of the sahuagin that might drive an encounter—or an entire campaign.</p>
    <p>The Valraean Cold War. The sahuagin hate the sea elves and yearn to hold dominion over the entirety of the Thunder Sea. The power of the Undying Court protects the elves from any direct assault, so the sahuagin must find another answer. They’ve been embedding malenti agents into the Valraean Protectorate for years. What’s the next step? Will they launch a decisive first strike from within the Protectorate? Will they target Shae Mordai itself? Might they be willing to forge an alliance with a dragonmarked house or a dryskin nation to bring down the Protectorate?</p>
    <p><strong>Consume the Overlords.</strong> The sahuagin don’t need more land, but they’re always hungry for more power. The most powerful beings in Eberron are the overlords of the First Age. These archfiends have lingered in their prisons since the dawn of time—while they can’t be destroyed, could they be consumed? Could a sahuagin champion follow Sha’argon’s path to divinity by somehow devouring the essence of an overlord, thus taking its spirit and strength? This goal could bring sahuagin agents to the surface if they determine the most vulnerable overlords are imprisoned on land. This is no simple task; it could require eldritch machines, planar alignments, and a particular unfolding of the Prophecy. Rak Tulkhesh is bound to multiple shards; perhaps the sahuagin have found a way to consume these one at a time, and now seek each shard. What will happen if a sahuagin champion completes this ascension?</p>
    <p>The Conquest of the Planes. The kar’lassa give the Eternal Dominion a foothold in eight planes, and they’ve been learning new ways to exploit this over the last century. Now, some among the Ta’har wonder if they could expand their influence, using the kar’lassa as an anchor from which to conquer a layer of a plane. This idea is unprecedented—is it even possible? Success could depend on recovering Artifacts created by the Cul’sir giants during their war against the quori, and the sahuagin would need a way to bind the immortal spirits of that plane. Which plane will they try to conquer? What would happen to Eberron if they succeeded?</p>
    <p><strong>Strange Trade.</strong> A group of adventurers could accompany a Cannith delegation sent to Hal’syri to negotiate for Siberys shards. Or they could be sent to the ocean floor in search of kar’lassa blood or forgotten relics from ancient ruins.</p>
    <p><strong>Deadly Shortcuts.</strong> A vessel could run afoul of Dominion forces when it strays into forbidden territory, adventurers finding themselves bound for Hal’shavar, compelled to battle in the great arena. Or perhaps a dragonmarked heir could change their fate, bargaining with the sea devils and initiating an alliance with their house.</p>
    <p>The Lurker in Shadow. The schemes of the Lords of Dust threaten all people. When aboleths serving the Lurker in Shadow threaten a coastal community, the adventurers could end up working alongside Dominion champions to fight the archfiend. Perhaps an aboleth uses sahuagin thralls to try to start a war between the surface and the sea; can the adventurers expose the plot?</p>
    <p><strong>Locathah Rising.</strong> The locathah were conquered long ago, and toil as subjects of the Eternal Dominion. But a resistance could be forming within the locathah, drawing adventurers into the conflict. Some locathah may possess the gift of lucid dreaming, allowing them to meet secretly within the dreams of the kar’lassa; they have no weapons in the waking world, but they could be building schemes and supplies in their dreams.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Karakala: Merfolk</h3>

    <p>Children of the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, the merfolk have been drawn into Eberron time and again during grand convergences between the planes. Merfolk can be found across the seas of Eberron, and every kara—tribe—has its own traditions and customs. The primary merfolk culture in the Thunder Sea is Karakala, whose members call themselves the Kalamer.</p>
    <p>The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they’re nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they’re recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers—an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they’ve managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.</p>
    <p>Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones—which they call the roots—and performing the rituals that keep them stable. However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those who bend nature for their own benefit—dryskin, sahuagin, and sea elf alike—and especially oppose the use of elemental binding; these have come to see House Lyrandar as their foes. There are Kalamer who dream of someday cleansing the oceans of all traces of industry, of unleashing the full power of the manifest zones instead of keeping them contained. To date, Karakala has maintained its peaceful course, but it’s always possible that their darker impulses will rise to the fore—that they’ll show House Lyrandar and the nations of the world the true power of the storm.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Culture</h4>

    <p>The Kalamer are a primal people, feeling the currents, tides, and winds in a profound way; some say that the ocean sings a song. Consider these philosophies when dealing with merfolk of Karakala:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>“The water is always moving; follow it, let the currents guide you.” Kalamer prefer to remain in motion, and rely deeply on instinct and intuition.</li>
            <li>“Flow around a problem or away from it.” Kalamer value flexibility over pride and aggression.</li>
            <li>“Keep only that which lifts you up, not what drags you down.” Kalamer avoid anything that anchors them too strongly to one place or mood, including property and vendettas.</li>
            <li>“Make no judgment until you know the story.” Kalamer are naturally curious and seek to understand the people and things they encounter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Karakala is a culture rather than a nation. There are approximately ten thousand Kalamer spread across the Thunder Sea, but they claim no territory and have no single leader. Most live in small pods, following a pattern of migration between the manifest zones of the upper water. When they reach a manifest zone, they remain there for a week or so, performing primal rituals that stabilize the zone. They prize manifest zones to Lamannia, and time spent at a Lamannian zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful effects of any manifest zone.</p>
    <p>The Kalamer don’t worship deities, but revere the forces of nature and believe the world speaks to those who listen. While outsiders might view this as worshiping Eberron, the Kalamer don’t need to anthropomorphize nature for it to be worthy of reverence. The Kalamer value wisdom over strength, and the leader of the pod holds that position because the others trust their instincts; often they’re an elder, but age isn’t a requirement.</p>
    <p>In general, Karakala is peaceful; this is one reason both the Dominion and Protectorate allow the Kalamer to move freely. Most merfolk seek to understand any threats they encounter, to see if they can find a way to coexist—or failing that, to simply move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes when they’re forced to act or encounter a true threat to the balance of nature.</p>
    <p>Kalamer fashion is simple and functional. It’s rare for Kalamer to wear anything heavier than Leather Armor, and most just wear leather straps to hold their tools and personal possessions. Many carry small tokens—shells, stones, bones—that remind them of a place or moment. Sometimes humans describe hearing the sound of the ocean in a shell; however, many Kalamer truly receive primal impressions from natural objects.</p>
    <p>Kalamer speak Aquan, their native tongue from Lamannia. Most of them also speak either Elvish, Common, or Sahuagin, depending on where their route takes them, and merfolk bards may speak all of these. Any Kalamer capable of casting at least one Druidic spell can speak Druidic, which they consider to be the language of the wind and water.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Territory</h4>

    <p>The merfolk of Karakala can be found across the Thunder Sea; Kalamer pods follow migratory patterns, while wandering sirens let intuition guide them. The Kalamer remain in the upper waters where sunlight allows photosynthesis. There are no Kalamer cities, but they establish simple outposts along their migratory paths, often in masses of floating vegetation (which are especially common in Lamannian manifest zones).</p>
    <p>Many pods bond with a dragon turtle, which serves as the locus of the pod; the merfolk strap themselves to the turtle when they sleep. Unlike the dragon turtles of the Eternal Dominion, this is a symbiotic relationship; the merfolk help their companion find food and keep the dragon turtle entertained. Other pods bond with Gargantuan beasts that have passed into Eberron from Lamannia.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tools and Traditions</h4>

    <p>Karakala has no tradition of wizardry or artifice. However, most Kalamer possess at least a touch of primal magic, and can Shape Water or strike a foe with a Thunderclap; this can be reflected by giving Kalamer merfolk a cantrip or single-use spell from the Druid or Ranger spell list. Kalamer with greater gifts are called stormcallers, and can summon lightning and wind; these are discussed in more depth in chapter 8. Kalamer champions could possess the abilities of Rangers or Druids, and might be able to assume the forms of deadly sea creatures.</p>
    <p>Other Kalamer hear music in the motion of wind and water and become bards. Kalamer sirens can weave illusions with their words, or cloud the minds of enemies. These sirens often travel alone, sharing news and songs both with Kalamer pods and with all other ships and communities they come across. While most Kalamer bards seek to bring joy to everyone they encounter, there are stories of sirens turned bitter after the destruction of a pod or witnessing great cruelty; these merfolk may turn their powers to punishing those they see as evil. Kalamer bards generally rely on their voices as opposed to using instruments, and can sing while submerged.</p>
    <p>The people of Karakala create their tools from natural materials—stone, shell, leather, bone. Their magic items—mostly potions, amulets, and charms—produce primal effects.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Foreign Relations</h4>

    <p>Karakala is politically neutral, holding no nation or people above any other. A siren or pod may have a strong bond to a particular fishing village, but that affection doesn’t extend to the dryskin nation that claims it. Generally, Karakala tries to ignore the actions of nations, focusing on its never-ending pilgrimage, though individual Kalamer—sirens, Landwalker champions—may become more actively involved with a single nation.</p>
    <p>While they maintain their neutrality and serve as messengers and couriers between all the people of the sea, Karakala doesn’t like the Eternal Dominion or the Valraean Protectorate. The Kalamer dislike seeing any creature held in bondage, and they may help renegade locathah or smugglers sailing beyond approved Dominion routes. However, while they may help peaceful smugglers, they dislike cruelty and greed; violent pirates can find that the merfolk are just as dangerous as House Lyrandar or a Dominion patrol.</p>
    <p>To date, Karakala has been a passive, mediating force, trusted by all. But the fact remains that Kalamer dislike all forms of industry in the sea. If it were an option, many Kalamer would destroy all dryskin shipping and shatter the cities of the Dominion and Protectorate alike. Currently, they work to contain the manifest zones of the Thunder Sea and to keep peace; but if they chose, they could instead release the power of these zones to terrible effect. Hostile Kalamer could begin by calling elemental tempests and megafauna beasts from Lamannia and unleashing them into shipping lanes, increasing the dangers of the sea—with plausible deniability as to their source. By coordinating rituals with coterminous periods, the Kalamer could dramatically enhance the effects of manifest zones. Using the Lamannia zones in this way, they could create devastating hurricanes and tsunamis. Could tidal waves devastate Stormreach, or elemental hurricanes topple one of the towers of Sharn? Karakala has no interest in conquest; if the merfolk pursued this course of action, it would purely be to drive commerce and civilization from the sea.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Merfolk Adventurers</h4>

    <p>Kalamer are at home in the water, and rarely have any interest in walking on dry land. However, a few do hear the wind calling them to emerge from the water. A Kalamer who embraces this path can gain the ability to transform into a fully humanoid form, their tail splitting into two legs allowing them to operate freely on dry land. These remarkable individuals are called Landwalkers, and a Kalamer Landwalker species is presented in Chapter 6.</p>
    <p>Most Kalamer Landwalkers have a strong sense of purpose—a call that’s drawn them to leave their pod and the sea behind. In general, the Kalamer work to protect the balance of nature; a Landwalker might be drawn to investigate the Mourning, to help the Gatekeepers battle aberrations, or even to oppose the dragonmarked houses. Such a champion of nature might be a Druid of the Circle of Sea, a Ranger, or even a Paladin with the Oath of the Ancients.</p>
    <p>A Kalamer Landwalker could also be a Bard; sometimes it’s easier to investigate the Mourning or fight dragonmarked houses with words instead of primal magic. Landwalker Bards are likely to follow their people’s drive to help bring people together and settle disputes. The College of Glamour could reflect the enthralling song of the siren, but the College of Lore is also an option for a Landwalker Bard.</p>
    <p>As a Kalamer Landwalker, you’ve left your entire world behind you. Do you miss your pod and the songs of the ocean? Or are you following the basic drives of Karakala—to always move forward, and not to let the anchors of the past pull you down? As someone born in a wild, primal world, how do you deal with the intense civilization of a city such as Sharn?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Story Hooks</h4>

    <p>The Kalamer aren’t conquerors. What could draw them into a story? Consider the following ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>The Traveling Siren.</strong> As adventurers visit a coastal town, they hear a beautiful, clear song rising from the harbor and see people running towards the pier. The arrival of a Kalamer siren is a celebrated event along the southern coast; even the Ghaal’dar welcome friendly sirens. These bards bring news and stories of the sea—of ships in the area, storms, or even just gossip from the next village down the coast—combined with enthralling song. Aside from being an interesting scene, the siren could bring news that’s directly relevant to the adventurers—perhaps news of a ship they were waiting for that was sunk offshore, or perhaps they’ll share a story of a ruin hidden off the coast. As sirens act as intermediaries, a bard could also come carrying a message for the adventurers from a powerful figure in the Dominion or Protectorate.</p>
    <p><strong>Salvation at Sea.</strong> Perhaps the characters’ ship leaves the safe trade routes and runs afoul of an endless storm. Or maybe they’re simply crippled by pirates, or by a forgotten weapon of the Last War. A pod of Kalamer can save the characters, using primal magic to allow the dryskins to breathe underwater, helping them to safety. But do the Kalamer need something in return? A powerful monstrosity could be lurking around a manifest zone, preventing the pod from performing their rituals. Or an aboleth serving the Lurker in Shadow may have captured members of their pod; they need help to defeat the beast.</p>
    <p><strong>The Vengeful Storm.</strong> Though Kalamer are peaceful, the stormcaller Llaratala can no longer share the water with House Lyrandar and its oppression of elementals. She and her pod are targeting elemental galleons, shattering Lyrandar ships and freeing the bound spirits. The house hires the adventurers to find out who’s responsible for the destruction of their vessels. How will the characters track the merfolk mastermind, and what will they choose to do?</p>
    <p><strong>Druidic Allies.</strong> A Kalamer hails the druid of the party while the adventurers are on the coast or on a ship. The stormcaller addresses them in Druidic, as a fellow defender of the natural world, asking them to help deal with an unnatural threat. This could be an aboleth or aberration, or a danger posed by a manifest zone—such as Mabar or Fernia—that’s experiencing a wild surge and steadily growing worse. Can the druid and their companions help contain the threat?</p>
    <p><strong>Intermediaries.</strong> The Kalamer act as couriers and envoys between the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion. While sailing, the adventurers come upon a dead Kalamer. The message it was carrying could be the key to stopping a new outbreak of war between these two nations. Can the characters find a way to deliver it?</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr">The Valraean <br /> Protectorate: Sea Elves</h3>
    <p>Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha’argon’s Kingdom—a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion—steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha’argon’s Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into sea elves, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.</p>
    <p>Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha’argon’s Kingdom couldn’t match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha’argon border fortresses. It was at this time—when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands—that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island’s security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed—both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.</p>
    <p>The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin—first Sha’argon’s Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion—continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn’t challenge the elves within the Court’s sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Culture</h4>

    <p>Most subjects of the Valraean Protectorate are locathah and sahuagin; despite this, the Protectorate is modeled after Aereni society in many ways. In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth—but in this case, they seek to be worthy of serving the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They’re ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.</p>
    <p>The sea elves of the line of Valraea live in the midst of this enforced adulation. They’re idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they were shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren’t petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people—but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they’re taught that they’ll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that elves are glorious and better at everything than you. As a Valraean you’re just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It’s your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate. And while no non-elf has ever proven worthy to join the Undying Court—how could they, with a paltry century to perfect their skills—maybe, just maybe, if you keep working hard enough and become the best person you can be, you might be the first.</p>
    <p>While many members of the line of Valraea believe their own propaganda, the simple truth is that the benevolent Protectorate is an oppressive regime, sometimes brutally so. The line of Valraea has long worked to stamp out all traces of the native cultures, replacing the local languages with Elvish and eliminating the locathah religion. Few subjects publicly challenge elven rule, but those who do are quickly silenced. But despite these efforts, there are those among the masses who resist the Valraean propaganda and seek to reclaim and preserve their ancient traditions. Rebel sahuagin may work with malenti and support Dominion espionage. The locathah have a more difficult path, as for their kind, life in the Dominion would be even worse than in the Protectorate. But the locathah resistance still clings to hope, believing that as long as they are free in their hearts, they may yet find a way to overthrow all of the tyrants.</p>
    <p>Valraean subjects are split into houses, each of which includes members of multiple species; this, in part, serves to deemphasize the importance of direct family. Each house has a patron in the Undying Court. They are taught to idolize this patron and believe that it personally protects them; in some cases this may actually be true, though many deathless councilors pay no attention to their Valraean devotees. Regardless, the Valraeans’ ongoing adoration of the Undying Court provides a valuable source of positive energy for the Court itself.</p>
    <p>Valraean fashion largely mirrors that of Aerenal, though using different materials. Fine leather takes the place of cloth, and Valraeans generally wear less clothing than their counterparts on the surface. Coral, ivory, and bloodvines (described in Tools and Traditions) are often used as ornaments. As in Aerenal, masks are important accessories; elves wear full face masks, while accomplished non-elves generally wear masks that cover their lower faces.</p>
    <p>All subjects of the Protectorate speak Elvish. This replaces Aquan among locathah and Sahuagin among sahuagin. Those who dream of resistance work to preserve their ancestral languages, but they’re not spoken where elves can overhear them.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Territory</h4>

    <p>The Valrean Protectorate extends approximately 150 miles from the coast of Aerenal. Within this radius, the Undying Court wields great power; it can control the weather and produce other dramatic environmental effects. As a result, the Protectorate truly seems a blessed land; the waters are peaceful and the weather is beautiful. The Protectorate includes settlements along the shelf in the upper water and on the ocean floor.</p>
    <p>The Protectorate has fought many wars with the Eternal Dominion and its predecessors. Ultimately, the transcendental power of the Undying Court holds enemies at bay, but over thousands of years, the Protectorate has developed and fortified defenses on the border of their territory. A series of bone-coral towers stand along the front, connected by rune-lines—glowing patterns engraved in the sea-bed that help focus and channel the power of the Court when it is needed. The region contains Spirit Mines—floating ivory spheres that conjure angry ghosts into any ship that comes too close—and other defenses. All shipping is wise to follow the sanctioned routes for entry.</p>
    <p>The manifest zones in this region are mostly tied to Irian and Mabar. However, there are a few manifest zones tied to Lamannia, and those in the upper waters are prone to the violent surges seen in zones across the sea. While the Undying Court can contain these surges, this is an expenditure of energy on their part; as a result, the Valraeans welcome the merfolk of Karakala, whose rituals stabilize the zones.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Tools and Traditions</h4>

    <p>Valraeans of all species practice the same traditions as the elves of Aerenal. Though magic is widespread in the Protectorate, Valraean subjects aren’t taught the higher arts, so the overall level of common magic is more on par with the Five Nations, with greater wonders seen in the coral palaces of the line of Valraea. The common populace of the Protectorate includes magewrights and adepts, with a handful of gifted wizards. While all subjects are taught to worship the Undying Court, the actual priests are sea elves.</p>
    <p>Sea elves of the line of Valraea typically focus on divine or arcane magic. The sea elves are encouraged to think of themselves as divine champions, and many do become clerics or paladins. Arcane spellcasters are typically wizards, and the strengths of the Protectorate are divination, abjuration, and necromancy. There are also a handful of artificers among the line. While the power of the Undying Court defends the region, the line of Valraea maintains the many wards and monitors the seas for sahuagin activity, or any other threat that might arise.</p>
    <p>The artisans of the Protectorate work with the exotic woods of Aerenal, but they use other exotic materials as well. Leather is the primary material used in clothing, both fine, thin leather for simple fashions, and tougher hides for armor. Bone-coral is a form of coral that is artificially grown and hardened using arcane techniques, used for everything from buildings to ornaments. Bloodvines are an aquatic form of Aereni livewood; they draw sustenance from any creature in contact with them (though not so much as to be noticeable in any way) and thus remain alive, even when shaped into ornaments or armor.</p>
    <p>The artificers of the line of Valraea are curious about the arcane potential of kar’lassa biomatter—the foundation of Dominion arcane magic—and are always eager to acquire it. Valraean sahuagin don’t have access to the magebreeding and alchemical techniques of the Eternal Dominion; as a result, they develop as any other creatures would, instead of being guided down a particular path. This also means the Protectorate doesn’t have any of the secondary mutants—such as barons, malenti, and Claws of Sha’argon—found in the Dominion.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Foreign Relations</h4>

    <p>The Valraean Protectorate is an extension of Aerenal, and diplomacy with surface nations is conducted by the elves of the islands. Generally, the only time surface-dwellers encounter sea elves or Valraean subjects is at customs checkpoints when approaching Aerenal; thus, sailors may be familiar with them, but most people of the Five Nations have never seen a sea elf or a locathah. Aerenal takes the security of its coastal waters seriously, and ships must adhere to specific shipping lanes or risk running afoul of Spirit Mines and other traps.</p>
    <p>Today, the Valraean Protectorate remains at a chilly impasse with the Eternal Dominion of the sahuagin, as Valraea strengthens its defenses and the Dominion works to place ever more malenti agents within the Protectorate. Both refused to engage in direct commerce or diplomacy with each other, though the Dominion allows Aereni vessels to use their shipping lanes (at a price). Karakala serves as an intermediary between the two, carrying messages and conducting simple trade.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Valraean Adventurers</h4>

    <p>Elves of the line of Valraea rarely leave the Protectorate. They have important duties to tend to, and issues in the surface world are generally dealt with by the elves of the island. However, the line of Valraea is devoted to the Undying Court, and an adventurer could be following a direct mandate either from the court itself or from a specific deathless sea elf. To make such a character, create an Elf (Valraeans usually have High Elf Lineage) and take the Aquatic Adaptation Origin feat provided in chapter 6. You might be a Cleric using the Life Domain, or a Paladin following the Oath of the Ancients or the Oath of Devotion. In any case, this character would likely be proud; in your eyes, you’re a celestial in the service of the divine.</p>
    <p>Or you might be a sea elf who questions the traditions of the Protectorate. Perhaps you feel that the Protectorate—and Aerenal as a whole—should be emulating the spirit of innovation of the Five Nations rather than just holding to Aereni arcane traditions. As an Artificer or Wizard, you could be determined to study as many other systems of magic as possible; you don’t believe that the defenses of the Protectorate will hold forever, and you want to develop something new.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you could play a locathah from the Valraean Protectorate (using the species traits presented in Locathah Rising). Locathah are all but unknown on Khorvaire. As a Valraean Locathah, you have the benefits of Aereni education, and may have adopted many elf mannerisms. Are you a proud champion of your nation and a loyal servant of the Undying Court? Or were you exiled after you opposed the Aereni oppression of your people? If so, are you acting in the interests of Valraean locathah now? Do you want to find a way for your people to develop their own deathless? Or are you following your own path in the world, leaving the Protectorate in your wake?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Story Hooks</h4>

    <p>The Valraean Protectorate is an isolated part of a hidden nation. What could bring it into a story? Consider the following ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>The Cold War.</strong> Whether on land or sea, adventurers could stumble into a Dominion plot to wreak havoc in the Protectorate. Thousands of innocents will die if they do nothing; what’ll they do?</p>
    <p><strong>Fish Farm.</strong> The adventurers are on a ship that is drawn off course (by hijackers? a freak occurrence?) and runs afoul of Valraean defenses, crippling the vessel. The characters are rescued by a group of Valraean locathah who maintain a farm on the edge of a small island. While waiting for someone to retrieve them, the adventurers get to know these locathah... <br/> and perhaps discover a dangerous secret hidden on the tiny island.</p>
    <p>Deathless for the People. A group of Valraean visionaries—locathah, sahuagin, and sympathetic sea elves—are determined to develop sahuagin or locathah deathless, their first step to establishing equality within the region. These revolutionaries are searching out scattered tombs that tie to the creation of deathless, along with Artifacts that channel the power of Irian. Are their methods peaceful or violent? Will the adventurers assist them or oppose them?</p>
    <p>Dead or Alive? To strengthen their support among the common people, the line of Valraea proclaims that a locathah hero has been raised to the Undying Court—the first non-elf to be admitted. But is this true, or is it a lie to placate the masses? The adventurers are hired to investigate, and if it’s a hoax, to expose it. Are their patrons members of the locathah resistance, or might they be unknowingly working for the Eternal Dominion?</p>
    <p>The Quest for Hal’thela. The Protectorate is eager to tap the power and the potential of the kar’lassa, and the best candidate is Hal’thela—the kar’lassa bound to Thelanis. But the kar’lassa is deep behind enemy lines. Can the adventurers help find its location and lead a team there? Why do the sahuagin shun it? Is it simply that they can’t control the capricious fey? Or is the entire region touched by a fey curse—something that must be lifted before anyone can explore it safely?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Aboleths: The Darkest Depths</h3>

    <p>There are places where even sahuagin fear to swim. Like all the overlords, the Lurker in Shadow couldn’t be destroyed, only imprisoned. It’s bound in Khyber, deep below the center of the Thunder Sea. But there are passages to its prison spread across the region, in vast rifts and lightless tunnels. The servants of the Lurker linger in these places, building their strength and watching the world above.</p>
    <p>The chief servants of the Lurker in Shadow are the aboleths. Though driven from the sea itself, they’ve maintained a shadow empire in the tunnels below the seabed. Across eras, they’ve collected their subjects—locathah, sahuagin, withered storm giants, people of the Five Nations stolen from their ships. Those aboleths with little interest in humanoids instead craft aberrations and monstrosities, like the chuul. While the aboleths have no direct ties to the Lords of Dust, there are fiends among their allies—shadow demons and other spirits created by the Lurker in Shadows. The aboleths also possess untold riches and powerful Artifacts from the Age of Demons—tools they can use to arm their allies, or to motivate with greed and bribery when direct mental domination isn’t an option.</p>
    <p>The aboleths have risen en masse in the past, bringing down previous civilizations, fomenting war between the sahuagin and the giants. There have been dark centuries where the aboleths have ruled the sea—though these days were long before the rise of Galifar, and humanity knows little about the threat.</p>
    <p>Today, the aboleths are spread across the ocean, and it’s up to the DM to decide how powerful they are. Are they a hidden empire preparing to shake the world? Or are there just a few in hiding, preying on forgotten fishing villages and stealing thralls from shipwrecks? Consider the following ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>The Pirate King.</strong> A new wave of piracy spreads across the trade lanes in the vicinity of Stormreach. The villain is Red Daskia, a Cloudreaver captain from the Lhazaar Principalities. But she has fiendish allies and Artifacts from the Age of Demons that let her vessel outrun even Lyrandar vessels and disappear in fog. When the adventurers finally confront the pirate queen, it becomes clear that she’s merely the agent of an aboleth mastermind; can the characters stop the true villain?</p>
    <p><strong>Sahuagin Assault.</strong> The adventurers are caught in what seems to be a Dominion attack on a coastal community or peaceful vessel. An aboleth has seized control of a Dominion outpost and is seeking to cause conflict between the Dominion and the surface; it might also stage dryskin attacks on Dominion bases. Can the adventurers get to the bottom of it?</p>
    <p>Civil War in the Sea. A cabal of aboleths have gained control of the leaders of Hal’shavar. They use this power to foment unrest across the Dominion, turning city against city. These conflicts could spill out to peaceful travelers; a major assault could even affect Sharn or Stormreach. Could this bring down the entire Dominion? At first, the adventurers only encounter the side effects of the conflict, until a student of the Draconic Prophecy realizes that if the Dominion collapses, the Lurker in Shadow will be released. Can the adventurers end this civil war?</p>

    <p>The harpies who work with the Daughters of Sora Kell are more intelligent than their cousins, and have learned to use their remarkable voices—which they can amplify up to three times as loud as normal—for more than just luring enemies.</p>
    <p>A typical harpy songbird has an Intelligence of 10 (+0), a Wisdom of 12 (+1), and a Charisma of 14 (+2), along with the skills Performance +6 and Persuasion +4. A remarkable songbird might be able to cast spells from the Bard spell list.</p>

<aside>
    <p>Trapped in a Tale</p>
    <p>One thing that makes the Daughters interesting is that they aren’t simply mundane tyrants or warlords. They’re legends, and have matched wits with countless heroes. One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren’t easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, “Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise.” Sora Katra might then bring that story up: “I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I’d had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?”</p>
    <p>There’s no saving throw against this and no mechanical effect. It simply demonstrates that Katra has powers and influence that can’t be measured or fully defined. Perhaps she’s using some form of telepathy and the whole thing’s a con. Or perhaps she was there that night. The point is that she’s not just a powerful Bard; no one knows exactly what she can do. Likewise with Teraza’s visions, or the idea that Katra can weave curses on her loom—like eldritch machines, the limit on these abilities is whatever the story needs them to be.</p>
    <p>In many ways, the Daughters feel like characters pulled out of faerie tales, and the DM could draw inspiration from elements of Thelanis from chapter 5 (such as curses). But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they’re ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories.</p>

<aside>
    <p>The Myrnaxe</p>
    <p>As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the myrnaxe, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axeblade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Functionally, a myrnaxe is a Battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either Slashing damage (with the axe blade) or Piercing damage (with the spear). It’s common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk—thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes.</p>
    <p>The Znir consider the myrnaxe a signature weapon of their pact and don’t sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a myrnaxe is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.</p>
</aside>

<aside>
    <p>Gnoll Names</p>
    <p>The most important identifier for a Znir gnoll is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflections that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it’s impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names—names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflection of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don’t speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan name to a formal introduction: “Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.”</p>
    <p><strong>Gnoll Contract Names:</strong> Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych</p>

<aside>
    <p>The Two Meanings of Ghaal&apos;dar</p>
    <p>Ghaal’dar is the Goblin word for “mighty people.” It has always been the Dhakaani term for the hobgoblins, just as the goblins are golin’dar (“quick people”) and the bugbears are guul’dar (“strong people”). When used in lowercase—ghaal’dar—it refers to a hobgoblin of the Kech Dhakaan. However, when capitalized—Ghaal’dar—it’s the name of the federation of hobgoblin-dominated tribes that control modern Darguun. The Ghaal’dar tribes are not Dhakaani; they mimic some of their customs and are proud of their imperial history, but they were twisted by the Kapaa’vola and differ from the dar in many important ways.</p>
    <p>Likewise, dar means “people.” While common in the Goblin language, within this book, it’s generally used to refer to the Dhakaani goblinoids who were unaffected by the Kapaa’vola. Today, the Ghaal’dar and other Darguuls have largely adopted the human words for their kind—goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear. Dar—the golin’dar, ghaal’dar, and guul’dar—are the original goblinoids who resisted daelkyr corruption.</p>
</aside>

<aside>
    <p>Adventuring in the Uul Dhakaan</p>
    <p>The Uul Dhakaan is a stable region within Dal Quor. Dar are naturally drawn to it when they sleep, but it’s possible for other creatures to stumble on it by accident, or even to seek it out. Chot’uul monks guard the dream, along with guardians formed by the dream itself, but this security isn’t absolute.</p>
    <p>There are many reasons adventurers might seek out the Uul Dhakaan. It holds the memories of the Dhakaani Empire, and could contain secrets about a weakness of daelkyr or locations of ancient relics. The King’s Citadel might try to infiltrate the dream to learn more about the plans of the Kech Dhakaan. A Dhakaani character might need the help of other adventurers to repair some sort of disruption or corruption within the dream; are the chot’uul unable to see it, or have they themselves been corrupted? Again, while it is a repository of knowledge, the Uul Dhakaan is a dream, not designed for maximum efficiency or ease of use. Elements shift and change. You can revisit an ancient battlefield, but you’ll have to find that battlefield, or find a way to call it up from the collective well of memories. The uul’kala and chot’uul are trained to find their way around the dream-empire, but such travel isn’t always quick or easy.</p>
    <p>At the DM’s discretion, a character that serves as an uul’kala or a chot’uul might possess rituals that allow them to draw allies into a dream, each maintaining full consciousness within the Uul. Otherwise, dream adventures will require tools like the Uul’kur presented in chapter 7.</p>
    <p>So far, the quori have largely ignored the Uul Dhakaan. If anything, the stability of the dream-empire supports the overall goals of the Dreaming Dark, and the chot’uul are always watching for outside forces manipulating the dream. However, a campaign could explore a quori attempt to subvert the Uul, or consider the consequences of an alliance between the uul’kala and the Dreaming Dark. The Uul Dhakaan was formed in the current age of the Dreaming Dark; the Dhakaani know nothing of the quori belief in the Turning of the Age, and no one knows what will happen to the Uul Dhakaan when this occurs.</p>

    <p>The Mror Holds occupy the mountainous region that separates Karrnath from the Lhazaar Principalities. The Mror dwarves occupy this entire region, and they call it tra Mroreln, the Iron Roots. When humans first came to Khorvaire and settled the Lhazaar Principalities, they called the foreboding range to the west the Hoarfrost Mountains.</p>
    <p>Today, the Mror and most others refer to the entire region as the Ironroot Mountains. However, the people of the Lhazaar Principalities still call them the Hoarfrost, and some people use this term to refer to the mountains east of Mirror Lake.</p>

Resultingly, Zil scribes quickly became a standard feature in clan courts.</p>

The Frenzy can be blocked by any effect that prevents a victim from being subjected to the Charmed condition by an Aberration, or removed instantly by the Greater Restoration spell. Otherwise, if a victim is subjected to the Restrained condition and prevented from acting on their violent impulses, they can make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour they go without violence; on a successful save, the Frenzy ends.</p></td>

<aside>
    <p>Fantastic Oceans</p>
    <p>Venturing underwater can be a challenge for adventurers. They’ll need assistance just to be able to breathe. Chapters 2 and 3 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide present additional rules for underwater adventures; swimming is exhausting, it’s hard to see underwater, and many attacks suffer Disadvantage. At the same time, it can seem as though things aren’t limited enough. Shouldn’t something strange happen when you generate Lightning damage underwater? Shouldn’t spells that deal Cold damage freeze the water? And even if you can breathe underwater, if you go to the depths where the sahuagin are, thousands of feet under the surface, won’t the pressure crush you?</p>
    <p>It’s certainly possible to come up with more complicated rules that address all scientific concerns. But ultimately, the goal is to have a fantastic pulp adventure, not to realistically model a deep-sea dive. So it’s okay to follow the rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and not worry too much about the science—perhaps the magic allowing you to breathe underwater also protects you from changes in pressure.</p>
    <p>Ghosts of Saltmarsh also presents extensive options for running ocean adventures; many of these may offer inspiration as you build your undersea world. Regardless of the rules you decide to use, remember that the Thunder Sea isn’t on Earth. In addition to the environmental effects of manifest zones, you have the aftereffects of conflict between giants, dragons, and archfiends. You have flora and fauna that don’t exist on Earth, which have their own effects on the environment. A story should focus on creating an interesting, exciting environment to explore, even if it isn’t a realistic match for true marine ecology.</p>

    <p>Kar’lassa, Dar, Kalashtar, and Elves</p>
    <p>When the dar dream, they are drawn to the Uul Dhakaan, the shared dream of the empire—but when anyone dreams within 13 miles of a kar’lassa, they’re drawn into its dream. So what happens if a golin’dar dreams near a kar’lassa? These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar’lassa instead of to Dal Quor. However, all of the dream-tools crafted by the Kech Dhakaan—the Kra’uul and Uul’kur— function normally within the dream of a kar’lassa.</p>
    <p>What about kalashtar? Their connection to Dal Quor has been completely severed, but they do dream; when a kalashtar sleeps, they create dreams within their own mind, drawing on their memories and their quori spirit. However, if kalashtar find themselves within the range of a kar’lassa, they’re pulled into its dream, as with the dar.</p>
    <p>The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are aware of how the kar’lassa influence the dreams of “lesser” species. Though the Protectorate hasn’t yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don’t sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar’lassa—but this belief is wrong! It’s true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar’s quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human’s dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar’lassa—which would be a startling experience for an elf who’s never dreamed before!</p>

<aside>
    <p>Krakens</p>
    <p>The Thunder Sea is home to the ancient evil of the aboleths, who yearn to dominate the minds of all creatures. It holds the sleeping kar’lassa, who could devastate cities or nations if they rose from slumber. Where do the krakens fit in this hierarchy?</p>
    <p>Krakens are children of Khyber, born in the Age of Demons. Unlike the aboleths, they weren’t created by a fiendish overlord and they don’t serve any overlord; each kraken is a power in its own right. Krakens enjoy exercising their power and being worshipped by lesser creatures, and each one carved out a domain within the chaos of the Age of Demons. The binding of the overlords didn’t adversely affect the krakens; however, many feared that the alliance that had formed to defeat the fiends might well turn its attention to them next, so they chose to go into hiding and sleep, waiting for an age when the champions of the Age of Demons were dead and the oceans were free.</p>
    <p>Krakens are spread across all of the oceans of Khorvaire. For the most part, they don’t work together, in part to avoid the interest of Argonnessen. One kraken dominating an island of humanoids is of no concern to the dragons; an alliance of krakens is another story. However, multiple krakens have occasionally joined forces. Tens of thousands of years ago, five krakens devastated the previous civilization of the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea. Despite their power, they were eventually overcome; their remains are preserved in the city of Hal’shavar.</p>
    <p>There are a few krakens in the Thunder Sea, but they avoid the Eternal Dominion, dwelling either in its fringes or in dangerous places that are shunned by the sahuagin. The kraken Bastyreth has established a sanctum below the kar’lassa tied to Mabar; it’s raising a legion of undead minions and preparing to take vengeance on the Dominion.</p>

    <p>Other Sahuagin</p>
    <p>The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are an advanced and ancient culture that has little interest in the surface world. Its people generally wouldn’t randomly attack a fishing village. But what if you want an adventure where the sahuagin attack?</p>
    <p>The Eternal Dominion is a culture, but the sahuagin species extends beyond it. In Khorvaire, you have humans of the Five Nations, but you also have humans of the Shadow Marches and humans of the Demon Wastes. Similarly, the Eternal Dominion hasn’t extended beyond the Thunder Sea, and sahuagin in other waters may be very different; perhaps the sahuagin off the shores of the Demon Wastes are fiendish Sea Devils. Even in the Thunder Sea, the border sahuagin are wilder than those of the inner Dominion, and you could find sahuagin in the fringes that have never accepted the traditions of the Dominion. The Eternal Dominion is a sahuagin culture, but it’s not the only option. With that said, the secondary mutations—the barons, the malenti, the Claws of Sha’argon—are created using Dominion rituals and the blood of the kar’lassa, and these should be tied to the Eternal Dominion.</p>

    <p>Valraea and the Undying Cout</p>
    <p>The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are Aereni elves, though they use a different lineage. They still have cousins on the surface, take vacations on Aerenal, and travel to Shae Mordai to consult with the Deathless Councilors. So while there’s some cultural divergence, they’re still loyal to the fundamental principles of Aerenal and think of themselves as Aereni. And most of all, it is possible for sea elves of the line of Valraea to become deathless. There are deathless sea elves in the Valrean Protectorate—soldiers and councilors who protect and guide the people—and a few ancient sea elves sit on the councils of Shae Mordai.</p>
    <p>Some remarkable locathah and even sahuagin have been preserved as spirit idols, and these are held up as paragons to the common people; this is immortality you can attain! While the hope that a non-elf could become deathless has long been dangled in front of the people, it’s never been done, and isn’t something any elf believes is possible. However, the possibility is explored in Story Hooks later in this section.</p>

    <p>Sea Elves Beyond Valraea</p>
    <p>The line of Valraea are the sea elves of the Thunder Sea, but they aren’t the only sea elves in Eberron. If you want to play a sea elf but don’t want ties to the oppressive Protectorate, there are two additional options you can explore.</p>
    <p>The Line of Maraen. The Valraean Protectorate guards the Thunder Sea and holds the line between Aerenal and the Thunder Sea. But that’s not the only aquatic border of Aerenal. Along the eastern coastline, the elves of the line of Maraen are the sentinels of the Dragonreach. This isn’t a colony, but rather, a military operation. In the wake of the last draconic incursion, Valraeans were conscripted to serve the Maraen line, but in the Dragonreach, they’re not subjects, but soldiers and equals. Here, Maraen sea elves scout and fight alongside sahuagin and locathah. They hold firmly to the meritocratic principles that underlie Aerenal, and have formally adopted some of their non-elf soldiers into the line. They have yet to nominate a non-elf for admission into the Undying Court, but it’s certainly a path they may pursue.</p>
    <p><strong>The Lhazaar Exiles.</strong> The conflict between the Undying Court and the line of Vol shook Aerenal. While most of the line of Valraea were staunch supporters of the Undying Court, there were some among both Valraea and Maraen who saw the persecution of Vol as unjust and fought against their kin. After Vol was defeated, they went into exile with other supporters of the line, traveling north to the Lhazaar Principalities. A few dwell off the coast of Farlnen, where they have adopted the necromantic traditions of the Bloodsails. The rest followed their elf kin to Orthoss, where they are a proud part of the Wind Whisperer principality.</p>
