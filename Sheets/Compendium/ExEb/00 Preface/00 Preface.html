<p>Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world—which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.</p>
<p>I’m extremely proud of the world we’ve created. However, there are elements I love that I’ve never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations—considering the civilizations that the <a href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/exeb/Chapter-8-Friends-and-Foes#Merfolk'>Merfolk</a>, <a href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/exeb/Chapter-6-Character-Options#Sahuagin'>Sahuagin</a>, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down—or in some cases, cut entirely—in our original <em>Eberron Campaign Setting</em>. The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn’t nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a <em>Planes of Eberron</em> sourcebook, but it never came to pass—and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&amp;D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn’t have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I’ve always had dreams of <a href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/exeb/Chapter-4-Uncharted-Domains#Droaam'>Droaam</a> and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the <a class='sourcebook' href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/Wayfinders-Guide-to-Eberron'>Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron</a>, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron’s history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating <a class='sourcebook' href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/Eberron-Rising-from-the-Last-War'>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</a>—the first official fifth-edition hardcover—the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn’t enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.</p>
<p>That’s where Wayne Chang, who worked with me on the podcast Manifest Zone, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I’ve always wanted to explore—the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations—as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!</p>
<p>As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a tremendous amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I’m incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration. And I’m equally grateful to Luke Volker, David Barrentine, Cara Flynn, and Alex D’Amico, who helped to expand and update this book for the latest ruleset.</p>
<p>We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova&apos;s wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens <a href='https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/exeb/Chapter-3-Faiths-of-Eberron'>chapter 3</a>, to Marco Bernardini&apos;s amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it&apos;s been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life.</p>
<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive—including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis—who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.</p>
<p>Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You’ll find a few details that don’t align with previous sourcebooks; it’s up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there’s always a third option: using your answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now—when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death—we wanted Eberron to inspire players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon—and some, you might even ignore. This presents my Eberron, but I’m always thrilled to see people making the world their own.</p>
<p>And now—Eberron awaits!</p>
