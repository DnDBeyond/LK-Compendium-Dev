<div>
    <p>The dwarf muttered to himself as he <br/> scaled the imposing cliff. “‘It’s the plane of nature, Rusty!’ ‘It’ll be a vacation, Rusty!’ Well, this is the worst vacation I evaaaaaaaa—”</p>
    <p>Dela was already drawing her wand even as her companion began to fall. Her fingers tightened around Rev’s shoulder plating as she considered her options. Rusty was tied to the warforged, but his full weight on the rope could dislodge Rev and send them all tumbling down. In her mind, she pictured the threads of gravity pulling the dwarf down, then reshaped the pattern with her thoughts, weaving the threads into a malleable platform.</p>
    <p>“—aaaaoOOF!” Impact with the disk knocked the wind out of Rusty, but he wasn’t seriously injured. Dela rotated her wand, reeling in the threads of gravity and pulling the platform toward her. He sat up, glancing around. “Well, this is an improvement. Couldn’t you have done this earlier? Saved my shoulders?”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to waste the energy,” Dela said, struggling to maintain her concentration.</p>
    <p>“Why not? Don’t you think we’ve done enough climbing for a day? Or a lifetime?”</p>
    <p>Rev finally reached the top of the cliff. Digging his steel fingers into the soil, he pulled himself, Dela, and Gentle onto the plateau. Dela looked around... and then looked up. The plateau was dominated by a single massive tree—an oak taller than any of the towers of Sharn. Dela could see an airship nestled in the branches, like a child’s discarded toy. It was the Storm’s End. And they needed to reach it.</p>
    <p>Adventurers in Eberron can come from the depths of the oceans, the four corners of the world, and the planes beyond it. While exploring Eberron, you might lay claim to a Dhakaani artifact or bond with a daelkyr symbiont. This chapter provides unique options for player characters, designed to reflect the rich lore, diverse races, and vibrant cultures of Eberron.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Class Options</h2>

    <p>This section presents six new subclasses that highlight the vibrant cultures and unique species of Eberron. Some of the world’s most eccentric and brilliant innovators are Maverick Artificers, pushing the boundaries of science and magic. The ancient traditions of the renowned Dhakaani daashor live on in the Forge Adept Artificers of today. The College of the Dirge Singer reflects the wisdom and brilliant leadership that Dhakaani duur’kala offer in both war and peace. The kalashtar’s psychic powers are honed in the Mind Domain Cleric. The Circle of the Forged allows a Warforged Druid to become a beast of steel. And the Warrior of the Living Weapon is a Monk path that can be followed by Warforged, Shifters, Changelings, or Kalashtar—reflecting the unique potential of each species to harness their natural gifts.</p>
    <p>While most of these subclasses were developed with certain species in mind, they aren’t limited to them. If there’s a compelling story—a Vadalis supersoldier magebred to become a Warrior of the Living Weapon, a Cannith heir using the Circle of the Forged to represent a strange form of Warforged lycanthropy—any species can make use of these subclasses.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Artificer: Variant Capstones</h3>

    <p>The Soul of Artifice feature an Artificer gains at 20th level allows them to cheat death—sacrificing their creations to regain Hit Points when they drop to 0 Hit Points—and to regain uses of Flash of Genius after completing a Short Rest. While these are useful, they are also passive abilities that don’t capture the flavor of a particular subclass. With the DM’s permission, an Artificer who reaches level 20 can choose an alternative feature associated with their subclass instead of Soul of Artifice. This section presents variant capstones for the two subclasses introduced in this book, as well as the Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, Battle Smith, and Cartographer.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Alchemist - Level 20: Perfected Elixirs</h4>

    <p>You can create perfect elixirs with potent effects. When you produce elixirs at the end of a Long Rest, you also create one Panacea elixir and one Vivacity elixir. These elixirs follow the same rules as your other elixirs, but they can’t be produced in any other way.</p>
    <p>Panacea. The drinker is restored to full Hit Points and all conditions affecting them are ended. If the&#160;drinker has died within the last hour, they instead revive with 1 Hit Point. This elixir can’t revive a creature that has died of old age, nor does it restore any missing body parts.</p>
    <p>Vivacity. The drinker gains the benefits of your Resilience, Boldness, and Flight elixirs for 8 hours. When gained in this way, the Flight elixir grants a Fly Speed of 50 feet.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Armorer - Level 20: Overcharge</h4>

    <p>As a Magic action, you can overcharge your armor to unleash a torrent of energy forming a 100-foot-long, 15-foot-wide Line that blasts out from you in a direction you choose. The type of energy unleashed by the Line depends on your current armor model: Dreadnaught deals Force damage, Guardian deals Thunder damage, and Infiltrator deals Lightning damage. Each creature in the Line makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d6 damage of the appropriate type on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Artillerist - Level 20: Infused Cannon</h4>

    <p>You can infuse your cannons with eldritch energy, empowering them to produce more powerful effects. As a Magic action, you can cause one or both of your cannons to produce one of the effects listed below. Multiple cannons can use the same option or different ones.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).</p>
    <p>Dragonflame. The cannon exhales fire in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or carried start burning.</p>
    <p>Barrage. The cannon lobs a ball of concentrated energy at a point you choose within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the target area, and this damage ignores the damage threshold of objects.</p>
    <p>Restoration. The cannon emits a wave of curative energy, targeting itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it. Each target regains 25 Hit Points and is cured of the Blind, Deafened, Paralyzed, and Poisoned conditions.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Battle Smith - Level 20: Steel Vanguard</h4>

    <p>As a Magic action with Smith’s Tools in hand, you infuse your Steel Defender with arcane energy, granting it the following benefits for 1 minute.&#160;</p>
    <p>Multiattack. The Steel Defender gains the Multiattack action, allowing it to make four Force-Empowered Rend attacks.</p>
    <p>Flight. The Steel Defender gains a Fly Speed equal to its Speed.</p>
    <p>Protective Shield. The Steel Defender gains 50 Temporary Hit Points.</p>
    <p>Limitless Jolt. Using Arcane Jolt does not expend uses.</p>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a level 5 spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Cartographer - Level 20: Travel Anywhere</h4>

    <p>If you are one of the map holders for your Adventurer’s Atlas, you can cast Gate without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
    <p>When you cast the spell with this feature, the duration extends to 10 minutes and damage can’t cause you to lose Concentration. Also, you can choose to link the portal to a precise location on the same plane of existence or a different plane of existence.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Forge Adept - Level 20: Weapon of Legend</h4>

    <p>You are able to connect your spirit to your allies, making them living weapons. You gain the following benefits while wielding your Ghaal’Shaarat.</p>
    <p>Constant Aura. Your Aura of War is always active, and you can take a Bonus Action to change its damage type.</p>
    <p>Retributive Aura. Whenever an enemy starts its turn in your Aura of War, that creature takes damage equal to the extra damage provided by the aura.</p>
    <p>Empower Aura. As a Bonus Action, you can increase the extra damage provided by your Aura of War to 2d6. This increase lasts for 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.Maverick - Level 20: Improved Genius</p>
    <p>You can take a Magic action to cast any spell of level 8 or lower. This takes the place of the usual casting time of the spell, and you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast the spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect. Once you cast a spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Artificer: Forge Adept</h3>

    <p>Craft a Mighty Weapon out of Your Soul</p>
    <p>The daashor artificers of the Dhakaani Empire were the finest weaponsmiths in Khorvaire’s history, as discussed in chapter 4 of this book. As a Forge Adept, you carry on these ancient traditions, creating mystical weapons and armor, strengthening allies on the battlefield, and bringing down enemies with weapons imbued with your own soul energy. If you’re dar, you learned these techniques from the masters of your clan. Are you content to follow ancient traditions, or do you want to add your own innovations? If you’re not Dhakaani, did you learn these techniques from a daashor mentor? Did you steal this knowledge? Or are you replicating these traditions on your own?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Tool Proficiency</h4>

    <p>You gain proficiency with Smith’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.</p>
    <p>In addition, when you craft an ordinary or magic weapon, the amount of time required to craft it is halved.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Forge Adept Spells</h4>

    <p>When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Forge Adept Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Battle Ready</h4>

    <p>Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:</p>
    <p>Arcane Empowerment. When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</p>
    <p>Weapon Knowledge. You gain proficiency with Martial weapons. You can use a weapon with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Ghaal&apos;Shaarat</h4>

    <p>You can imbue a weapon with a fraction of your spirit, creating what the Dhakaani daashors call a ghaal’shaarat, Goblin for “mighty blade.” As a Magic action while you have Smith’s Tools in hand, you can turn&#160;a Simple or Martial Melee weapon into a Ghaal’Shaarat. The weapon continues to be a Ghaal’Shaarat until you imbue a different weapon or you die.</p>
    <p>The weapon gains the following benefits while you wield it.</p>
    <p>Mighty Blade. A nonmagical weapon becomes a magic weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, unless it already had this bonus or a better one.</p>
    <p>Returning Weapon. The weapon has the Thrown property with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. It returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack roll.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 5: Extra Attack</h4>

    <p>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 9: Runes of War</h4>

    <p>You gain the following benefits while wielding your Ghaal’Shaarat.</p>
    <p>Improved Mighty Blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, unless it already had this bonus or a better one.</p>
    <p>Aura of War. As a Magic action, you begin radiating a bolstering aura in a 30-foot Emanation that originates from you. Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.&#160; While in the aura, you and your allies each deal an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when&#160;hitting with a weapon attack or Unarmed Strike. The aura lasts for 1 minute, until you use this feature again, or until you end it (no action required). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 15: Perfect Weapon</h4>

    <p>The connection of your spirit to your weapon has been perfected. You gain the following benefits while wielding your Ghaal’Shaarat.</p>
    <p>Perfect Mighty Blade. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, unless it already had this bonus or a better one. Additionally, the first time you attack with your Ghaal’Shaarat on your turn, you can transfer some or all of the weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. The bonus remains until the start of your next turn.</p>
    <p>Elemental Strike. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using your Ghaal’Shaarat, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. Your Ghaal’Shaarat deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type; and you can cause the weapon to deal the chosen type of damage or&#160;its normal damage type.</p>
    <p>Soul Bound. You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">ARTIFICER: MAVERICK</h3>

    <p>Craft the Tool You Need in the Moment</p>
    <p>A Maverick Artificer is always tinkering, forever chasing a new idea. Where other Artificers focus on a single path of arcane science, the strength of the Maverick is flexibility. They may lack the discipline or credentials of their scholarly colleagues, but Mavericks have a talent for cobbling together exactly what’s needed to solve any problem.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Tool Proficiency</h4>

    <p>You gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. If you already have proficiency with Tinker’s Tools, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.</p>
    <p>In addition, when you craft a magic item, the amount of time required to craft it is halved.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Maverick Spells</h4>

    <p>You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Artificer, Cleric, or Wizard spell list. The chosen cantrip counts as an Artificer spell for you, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
    <p>In addition, any time you prepare Artificer spells, you can prepare an additional number of spells equal to your Proficiency Bonus. These additional spells can be chosen from the Artificer, Cleric, and Wizard spells lists, and the chosen spells count as Artificer spells for you.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Prototype</h4>

    <p>You’re always working on something new. Whenever you finish a Long Rest while holding Tinker’s Tools, you can use that tool to create a Prototype. While the appearance of the Prototype is up to you, it’s similar in functionality to a Staff of Power—it holds one or more spells and has a reserve of charges that can be used to cast those spells. Only you can use the Prototype to cast these spells; it’s an experimental creation that no one else can truly understand.</p>
    <p>When you create a Prototype, choose spells from the Artificer, Cleric, and Wizard spell lists to imbue into it; the number and maximum level of spells you can select are shown on the Prototype Spells table below. The Prototype has a number of charges based on your Artificer level. While holding the Prototype, you can cast one of the imbued spells by expending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell. Spells cast in this way count as Artificer spells for you and follow the regular rules for your Artificer spells in regard to casting time, components, and Concentration.</p>
    <p>The Prototype is destroyed if you expend its last charge or finish a Long Rest without replenishing it with imbued spells.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 5: Fine Tuning</h4>

    <p>Whenever you cast an Artificer spell while you have Tinker’s Tools in your possession, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 9: Work in Progress</h4>

    <p>Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can replace one of your prepared spells with a new spell from the Artificer, Cleric, or Wizard spell list. This spell counts as an Artificer spell for you.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 15: Final Breakthrough</h4>

    <p>Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can swap a spell contained in your Prototype for another spell of the same level, chosen from the Artificer, Cleric, or Wizard spell list.</p>
    <p>In addition, you ignore all class, species, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">BARD: COLLEGE OF THE DIRGE SINGER</h3>

    <p>Bolster your Allies with Story and Song</p>
    <p>Students of both history and war, Dirge Singer Bards use tales of past glory to inspire their allies and provide keen strategic insight, directing their comrades to strike when enemies are weak. This college was born in the Empire of Dhakaan, but over the course of the Last War, Cyre developed its own version of these techniques, and now Bards that follow this path keep the memory of their fallen nation alive through song.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Broad Inspiration</h4>

    <p>You know how to strengthen the hearts of your troops and stir them to greatness. You learn the Guidance cantrip, which counts as a Bard spell for you. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when you confer a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature, you can also confer that Bardic Inspiration die to a second creature within range.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Keeper of History</h4>

    <p>You gain proficiency in the History and Performance skills. If you already have these proficiencies, you instead gain Expertise.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 6: Commanding Voice</h4>

    <p>You excel at inspiring and directing soldiers in battle. When you take the Attack action or the Magic action on your turn, two creatures of your choice who possess one of your Bardic Inspiration die can expend it to use their Reaction to immediately make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, adding the Bardic Inspiration die to the attack’s damage roll on a hit.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 14: Battle Hymn</h4>

    <p>You unflaggingly maintain the spirits and discipline of your unit. As a Bonus Action, you can start a Battle Hymn which can be heard by all creatures within 60 feet. The hymn lasts until the start of your next turn. While the hymn is active, whenever an ally within 30 feet who can hear you makes an ability check or a saving throw, they&#160;can add 1d4 to the ability check or save.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Cleric: Mind Domain</h3>

    <p>Channel Divine Devotion into Psychic Power</p>
    <p>The Mind Domain celebrates the power of the mortal mind, channeling psychic energy to protect the faithful and smite your enemies. While this is most often associated with the Path of Light or the Riedran Path of Inspiration, followers of the daelkyr can also master this power. Visions of Xoriat can drive a priest to madness, but they can also reveal deadly secrets of the mind.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">LEVEL 3: MIND DOMAIN SPELLS</h4>

    <p>Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Mind Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Psychic Feedback</h4>

    <p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw, you can take a Reaction and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to impose Disadvantage on the saving throw, prying into their mind before they succeed or fail.Level 3: Psychic Force</p>
    <p>You learn to buffet your foes with mental power. When you cast a Cleric spell that deals Radiant damage, you can choose to have it inflict Psychic damage instead. When you cast a spell that deals Psychic damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage against one of the spell’s targets..</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 6: Gestalt Anchor</h4>

    <p>Your mental power increases, allowing you to project a sense of calm in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The projection is inactive if you have the Incapacitated condition.</p>
    <p>You and your allies in the projection gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.</p>
    <p>If another Mind Domain Cleric is present, a creature can only benefit from one Gestalt Anchor at a time.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 17: Bend Reality</h4>

    <p>When an ally you can see within 30 feet of yourself fails a saving throw, you can replace the roll with a 20, potentially changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">DRUID: CIRCLE OF THE FORGED</h3>

    <p>Shape-shift into Beasts of Steel and Wood</p>
    <p>What is truly natural? The warforged are living creatures, despite being constructed from wood and steel. Druids who embrace the Circle of the Forged explore the potential of the warforged form, blending animal shapes with warforged durability. Only a handful of Druids follow this Circle. Did you learn these techniques from a mentor? Are you driven by instinct, still learning what you’re capable of? Or, if you’re a Warforged, were you designed with the potential to assume multiple forms... and if so, who created you, and why?</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Skin of Steel</h4>

    <p>You can channel the power of the forge when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.</p>
    <p>Challenge Rating. The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).</p>
    <p>Armor Class. Until you leave the form, your AC equals 15 plus your Wisdom modifier if that total is higher than the Beast’s AC.</p>
    <p>Construct Resilience. You have Resistance to Poison damage. You also have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.</p>
    <p>Tireless. You don’t gain Exhaustion levels from dehydration, malnutrition, or suffocation. In addition, you don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
    <p>Obvious. While in a Wild Shape form, your body is made from the same materials as a warforged; your muscles are rootlike tendrils, and they’re protected by armored plates. It’s obvious to an observer that you are not a normal animal.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 3: Circle of the Forged Spells</h4>

    <p>When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Forged Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Level 6: Elementally Imbued</h4>

    <p>While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the following benefits.</p>
    <p>Elemental Strikes. Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type, Acid damage, Cold damage, Fire damage, or Lightning damage. You make this choice each time you hit with those attacks.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Backgrounds</h2>

    <p>This section provides background options for Changelings, Dhakaani goblinoids, and Malenti, reflecting the unique heritage of these species.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Changling Traveler</h3>

    <p>Ability Scores: Dexterity, Wisdom, Charisma</p>
    <p>Feat: Focused Personas</p>
    <p>Skill Proficiencies: Deception and Sleight of Hand</p>
    <p>Tool Proficiency: Thieves’ Tools</p>
    <p>Equipment: Choose A or B: (A) 2 Daggers, Thieves’ Tools, Bedroll, 2 Pouches, Shiftweave clothing, 10 GP; or (B) 50 GP</p>
    <p>You’re an urban nomad wandering from city to city. You spent your childhood traveling with your family, using your abilities to evade your enemies. Do you strive to be a force for positive change in the world, or are you an opportunist looking out for yourself? Most Changeling Travelers are Changelings. If you’re not a Changeling, you were born to a changeling parent and traveled with them; you could use a Disguise Kit or illusion magic to mimic their abilities.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Goblinoids</h3>

    <p>Dhakaani characters have generally been raised in Kech vaults, and a Dhakaani character’s background reflects their role in the Kech. Actual criminals are quite rare in the tightly controlled systems of the Vaults, but Criminal, Charlatan, or Wayfarer could all be used to reflect the training of spies or Khesh’dar. Sage or Entertainer are both good options for a Duur’kala character, even though these Bards are more than mere entertainers. Regardless of the background you choose, this chapter presents a few alternative Origin feats intended for Dhakaani characters. The Uul Dhakaan feat is available to all Dhakaani characters, while the Khesh’dar Training feat is intended for members of the Silent Folk. With your DM’s permission, you can substitute one of these Origin feats for the feat usually granted by your background.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Malenti</h3>

    <p>Ability Scores: Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma</p>
    <p>Feat: Aquatic Adaptation</p>
    <p>Skill Proficiencies: Deception and Insight</p>
    <p>Tool Proficiencies: Choose Thieves’ Tools, Poisoner’s Kit, or Forgery Kit</p>
    <p>Equipment: Choose A or B: (A) The equipment of a background related to the person you consumed; or (B) 50 GP</p>
    <p>You were born a sahuagin in the Eternal Dominion of the Thunder Sea, but ritual magic and the blood of the kar’lassa allowed you to consume and replace a surface dweller. You can never regain your original form; for all intents and purposes, you are who you appear to be. You’re physically indistinguishable from them, and you have enough of their memories to fool even their family and friends. But you have the mind of a sahuagin, and you’re loyal to the Dominion.</p>
    <p>As a Malenti, the first question is why the Dominion chose to replace this particular person, and how your mission relates to your activities as an adventurer. It’s possible that your only mission is to observe the dryskins and occasionally provide information to a sahuagin spymaster, or you might have a specific goal that drives your actions during your adventures.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Species</h2>

    <p>Heroes can emerge from any corner of the world. This section provides species and lineages that reflect many unique cultures of Eberron: Aasimar tied to Eberron’s planes and religions; the dar of the Kech Dhakaan; the Gnolls of the Znir Pact; the half-orc Jhorguntaal; and the Ruinbound that have recently appeared in the Mror Holds. If your DM allows it, you can play one of these species.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Aasimar</h3>

    <p>These rare humanoids have no culture of their own. Rather, aasimar are individuals shaped by exposure to divine forces or the energies of the planes, as discussed in chapter 3. The following variants reflect two unusual forms of Aasimar that can be found in Eberron.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Variant: Fernian Aasimar</h4>

    <p>If your Aasimar’s powers flow from Fernia, you are infused with otherworldly fire. When you use Celestial Revelation, your Heavenly Wings are formed from flame; your Necrotic Shroud is a terrifying aura of ghostly fire; and when you use Inner Radiance, enemies take Fire damage rather than Radiant damage. In addition, replace the Celestial Resistance and Light Bearer traits of the standard Aasimar with the following traits.&#160;</p>
    <p>Fernian Resistance. You have Resistance to Fire damage and Necrotic damage.&#160;</p>
    <p>Flame Bearer. You know the Produce Flame cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose the ability when you select this species).</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Variant: Mabaran Aasimar</h4>

    <p>If your Aasimar’s powers are drawn from Mabar, you are bound to shadows and despair. Replace the Light Bearer trait of the standard Aasimar with Herald of Death, and replace the Inner Radiance option of Celestial Revelation with Inner Darkness.</p>
    <p>Herald of Death. You know the Toll The Dead cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose the ability when you select this species).</p>
    <p>Inner Darkness. You consume light and life, creating a shroud of shadows. For the duration, you reduce Bright Light in a 20-foot radius to Dim Light, and at the end of each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes Necrotic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Ghaal&apos;dar (Hobgoblin)</h3>

    <p>Dhakaani hobgoblins are known as ghaal’dar, “mighty folk”—not to be confused with the Ghaal’dar tribes that dominate Darguun. The ghaal’dar are soldiers, scholars, and leaders, valued for their versatility and their vision.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Ghaal&apos;dar Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 30 feet</p>
    <p>As a Dhakaani Ghaal’dar, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Discipline. You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition.</p>
    <p>Strength in Unity. If you fail a D20 Test, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>
    <p>War and Peace. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Athletics, History, Intimidation, Performance.&#160;</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Dhakanni Golin&apos;dar (Goblin)</h3>

    <p>Dhakaani goblins are known as golin’dar, “quick folk.” They reproduce and mature faster than other dar, and form the bulk of the labor force in Dhakaani society. This includes menial labor, agriculture, food preparation, and skilled craftwork. Though ghaal’dar are the primary smiths of weapons and armor, most other manufacturing is done by the golin’dar. While this work may be less dramatic than the martial paths of the ghaal’dar and guul’dar, it’s vital to survival and the golin’dar are respected for their contributions. Other golin’dar take a different path, that of the Khesh’dar, the Silent Folk who live in the shadows of the empire.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">DHAKAANI GOLIN’DAR TRAITS</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Small (about 3–4 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 35 feet</p>
    <p>As a Dhakaani Golin’dar, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Discipline. You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition.</p>
    <p>Naturally Stealthy. You can take the Hide action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>
    <p>Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can’t stop in the same space.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Guul&apos;dar (Bugbear)</h3>

    <p>Dhakaani bugbears are known as guul’dar, “strong folk,” and are celebrated for their strength and courage. They help perform heavy labor where strength is required, but most yearn to prove their mettle on the battlefield, risking their lives to earn the glory known as atcha.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Dhakaani Guul&apos;dar Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Small (about 6–8 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 30 feet</p>
    <p>As a Dhakaani Guul’dar, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Brave. You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Frightened condition.</p>
    <p>Long-Limbed. When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</p>
    <p>Powerful Build. You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the Grappled condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.</p>
    <p>Stand by the Strong. When an ally within 30 feet that can see you fails a saving throw to avoid or end the Frightened condition, you can use your Reaction to allow them to reroll the saving throw.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Gnoll</h3>

    <p>Fierce and feral, the first gnolls were hyenas infused with malefic power by archfiends of war and the wild. They were created as cruel soldiers to serve in the endless conflicts of fiends, but over the course of countless generations a number of gnoll clans broke their ties to their demon overlords. These free gnolls are fiercely loyal to their pack and their clan, and serve as a stabilizing force within Droaam.&#160;</p>
    <p>Gnolls that are bound to the overlords are vicious and wild. Those who have escaped this bondage still have a fiendish spark within, but they contain and control this power. Some learn to wield it as Warlocks. Others known as hwyri train to fight demons and other supernatural threats. Even free gnolls can be aggressive, but they are gifted hunters and fiercely loyal to those they choose as family.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Gnoll Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid.</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 7–8 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 30 feet</p>
    <p>As a Gnoll, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Bite. Your teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. If you hit with them, you deal Piercing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier in place of the normal Bludgeoning damage of your Unarmed Strike.</p>
    <p>Hunter’s Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception, Stealth, or Survival skill.</p>
    <p>Rampage. When you use your Bite or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with an attack, you can take a Bonus Action to move up to half your Speed and make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike using your Bite.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Jhorgun&apos;taal (Half-orc)</h3>

    <p>Long ago, the orcs of the Shadow Marches welcomed human refugees from Sarlona. The two species have lived together in harmony for centuries. Most humans or orcs from the Marches have some degree of mixed lineage, even though they may use the game statistics of the species they outwardly resemble. However, the union of human and orc can produce children who have physical traits of both parent species. In the Shadow Marches, such people are called Jhorgun’taal, “children of two bloods”; they are celebrated as a symbol of the bond between orcs and humans. Jhorgun’taal blend the endurance of their orc ancestors with the flexibility of humanity.</p>
    <p>As House Tharashk has spread across Khorvaire, Jhorgun’taal are often found as inquisitives, bounty hunters, and prospectors. The Mark of Finding can manifest on humans, orcs, or Jhorgun’taal who can trace their ancestry to the Shadow Marches.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Jhorgun&apos;taal Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 30 feet</p>
    <p>As a Jhorgun’taal, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Relentless Endurance. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
    <p>Versatile. You gain an Origin feat of your choice.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Kalamer Landwalker (Merfolk)</h3>

    <p>The Kalamer merfolk dwell in the Thunder Sea, and most spend their entire lives beneath the waves. However, a few are called to walk above the water. Those that embrace this path may become Kalamer Landwalkers, gaining the magical ability to transform their fish-tail into a pair of humanoid legs. Landwalkers are exceptionally rare, and few surface-dwellers have ever seen one. Some Kalamer Landwalkers feel a call to accomplish a specific goal, fulfilling a mission for the good of the world. Others are driven purely by curiosity, and yearn to see new places and find wondrous things.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Kalamer Landwalker Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Elemental</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)</p>
    <p>Speed: 10 feet, Swim 40 feet</p>
    <p>As a Kalamer Landwalker, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p>
    <p>Amphibious. You can breathe air and water.</p>
    <p>Blessing of the Sea. You have two forms: your natural merfolk form and that of a landwalker. As a Magic action, you can shape-shift to change from your merfolk form to your landwalker form. While in your landwalker form, your fish-like fluke splits into 2 legs. Your Speed increases by 20 feet, but your Swim Speed is reduced to 0.</p>
    <p>You stay in the new form until you take a Magic action to revert to your merfolk form.</p>
    <p>Karakala Lore. You have proficiency in the Nature, Performance, or Survival skill.&#160;</p>
    <p>Swift Swimmer. You have a Swim speed equal to your Speed.&#160;</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">RUINBOUND</h3>

    <p>The Ruinbound are mutants that can be born to any humanoid species that has contact with the Daelkyr or their minions. A Ruinbound is born with a personal symbiont—an unnatural entity bound to the child. Unlike most symbionts, this entity cannot be separated from its host, and the two are permanently fused. Many Ruinbound have additional disturbing mutations; you can roll on the Ruinbound Mutations table for ideas, or create your own. These secondary mutations are disturbing, but they don’t change the rules of how that character is played or grant mechanical benefits. For example, even if a Ruinbound seems to have no eyes, their vision uncannily works as well as any other member of their species, though it defies logic.&#160;</p>
    <p>Aside from their mutations, Ruinbound share the appearance of their parent species. The Mror Holds have seen a surge of Ruinbound births since the War Below began, and there have always been Ruinbound orcs and humans in the Shadow Marches. Even in these places, however, the Ruinbound are rare and remarkable, and generally don’t pass their traits on to their offspring. More information about the Ruinbound can be found in the Mror Holds section of chapter 4.</p>
    <p>When making a Ruinbound character, work with your DM to determine the appearance of your Personal Symbiont. It is organic and clearly alien, and when you cast a cantrip with this trait, it should be obvious that the symbiont is the source. A symbiont that casts Mage Hand could be a thin tentacle or an ectoplasmic insect that emerges from your body and performs the action. An eyestalk protruding from your shoulder could grant you Guidance as it studies the situation and telepathically advises you—or it might blast your enemies with a Mind Sliver.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Ruinbound Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 4–7 feet tall) or Small (about 2–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this species</p>
    <p>Speed: 30 feet</p>
    <p>As a Ruinbound, you have these special traits.</p>
    <p>Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</p>
    <p>Personal Symbiont. You are bound to an alien entity that is part of your body and can’t be removed. Your symbiont possesses a minor supernatural ability, which it can use on your behalf. Choose a cantrip from the following list: Acid Splash, Guidance (self only), Light, Mage Hand, Mind Sliver, Poison Spray, Resistance (self only), Shocking Grasp, Thorn Whip. You can switch to a different cantrip from this list whenever you finish a Long Rest.</p>
    <p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this species).</p>
    <p>Symbiont Mastery. You can attune to one magic item that has the Symbiotic Nature property without it counting toward the maximum number of magic items you can attune to. In addition, whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can end your Attunement to a magic item that has the Symbiotic Nature property. When doing so, you can ignore any restrictions that require you be targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic before the symbiont can be removed.</p>
    <p>Unnatural Resilience. You have Resistance to Poison damage. You also have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.</p>
    <p>Ruinbound Mutations</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">SAHUAGIN</h3>

    <p>The sahuagin are an ancient species spawned in the ocean depths. With their armored skin and fearsome demeanor, they have long inspired terror in the people of the surface world. They are natural predators with aggressive instincts, kin to the shark and often devotees of the Devourer. But there is nothing innately evil about most sahuagin; in the depths of the Thunder Sea, sahuagin champions battle fiends and aberrations.</p>
    <p>Sahuagin are amphibious humanoids with leathery skin, sharp teeth, and webbed hands and feet. They have finlike crests on their heads, which extend and retract in response to their mood. While the majority of sahuagin have gray-green scales, others have scales with dramatic, colorful patterns.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Sahuagin Traits</h4>

    <p>Creature Type: Humanoid</p>
    <p>Size: Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Species Feats</h2>

    <p>These feats reflect cultural traditions and unique capabilities tied to the species discussed in chapter 2. Most of these feats are associated with a particular species, as summarized in the Species Feats table. For example, the Changeling Metamorphosis feat builds on a changeling’s innate shape-shifting ability, so a human can’t benefit from it. Some of these are General feats, which can be acquired at any point in a character’s career. Others are Origin feats, reflecting specific cultural traditions or biological features of a species. As long as your DM approves, you can replace the normal Origin feat granted by your character’s Background with an Origin feat associated with your species or backstory. So, if you’re playing an Elf Cleric from Aerenal, you might take the Acolyte background but replace the Magic Adept feat with Aereni Expertise.</p>

    <p>Playing a Warrior of the Living Weapon</p>
    <p>The Warrior of the Living Weapon showcases techniques developed by different cultures and species. The Forged Heart is a recent path, developed by warforged exploring the potential of their constructed frames. This involves both the physical evolution of the body and harnessing the strength of steel and stone. The Nightmare Shroud is a kalashtar tradition. Rather than physically transforming, a nightmare Monk generates ectoplasmic projections, manifesting claws of shadow. Blending physical blows with psychic attacks, they strike fear into the mind of their enemies. A kalashtar typically surrounds themselves with the image of their quori spirit, but the shroud can take any shape. The Traveler’s Blade was developed by tribal changelings, equipping the practitioners with versatile weapons that can’t be taken away. A practitioner can grow bone blades or knuckle ridges, or stretch their limbs to strike a distant foe. The Weretouched techniques were developed by shifter champions of Olarune, honing the natural weapons and strengths innate to their species.</p>
    <p>As a Warrior of the Living Weapon, you may draw on a singular technique, or you may instead combine multiple different styles. Both the abilities you gain from this subclass and the base abilities of the Monk class can reflect your ability to control and alter your physical form. When you use Slow Fall, you might be shifting your shape to craft gliding membranes (Traveler’s Blade) or catching the air in an ectoplasmic cloak (Nightmare Shroud). Your Unarmored Defense reflects defensive shape-shifting, and when you develop Empowered Strikes it reflects an enhancement of your natural weapons.</p>
    <p>Most of the Living Weapon techniques make use of natural gifts; for example, the Traveler’s Blade assumes that you possess the malleable form of a Changeling. However, any member of any species can follow these paths. If you don’t possess any innate shape-shifting gifts or a bond to a quori spirit, it’s up to you and your DM to explain how you manifest these gifts. If you’re not a Kalashtar, your Nightmare Shroud could be the ghost of an ancestor or lover, clinging to you and helping you fight. If you’re not a Changeling, perhaps you were altered by the daelkyr or part of a Vadalis supersoldier program—you can’t change your face, but you can still grow bone blades and stretch your limbs to strike distant foes.</p>
