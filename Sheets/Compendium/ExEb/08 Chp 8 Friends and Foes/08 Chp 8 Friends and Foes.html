    <p>This chapter describes and provides stat blocks for various creatures of Eberron, in addition to those presented in Eberron: Rising from the Last War and Eberron: Forge of the Artificer. For guidance on how to use a creature’s stat block, consult the introduction of the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Monsters by Creature Type</h2>

    <p>Here are the creatures in this chapter sorted by creature type.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Daelkyr</h2>

    <p>A daelkyr knows secrets mortals can’t comprehend and has plans they can’t understand. Some sages believe that the daelkyr are artists and that worlds are their canvas; they destroy civilizations and unleash monsters because, to them, this is a thing of beauty. Others say that the daelkyr exist beyond time, and that their actions only make sense when viewed over the course of millennia. Still others assert that any creature that can understand the motives of the daelkyr will immediately turn to their cause—that it is dangerous to study the daelkyr too closely, lest their revelations destroy all prior understanding and identity. While they may be enigmatic, the daelkyr are unquestionably evil; they shatter innocent lives and entire civilizations without any remorse.</p>
    <p>Unifying Theme. Each daelkyr has a unique theme; Belashyrra is tied to sight, Valaara to insects, and Dyrrn to corruption and evolution. This theme is reflected in the daelkyr’s appearance, in the minions it employs, and in the symbionts it creates. If the daelkyr is an artist, the theme is its medium. If it’s a conqueror, the theme defines its weapons and the world it seeks to create. Additionally, each daelkyr holds secrets and revelations relating to its specific theme—secrets mortal minds can’t comprehend. While in Belashyrra’s presence, people may remember things they’ve seen and forgotten. Around Valaara, they may feel insects burrowing through their flesh, or sense the thoughts of their allies—a momentary sensation of being part of a hive.</p>
    <p>Alien and Unsettling. In an encounter with a daelkyr, consider ways to express its alien nature, such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>A daelkyr can teleport 30 feet as a Bonus action. This reflects the idea that the daelkyr are loosely bound to space and time. The daelkyr shifts in space, but you can’t remember it moving. You could represent this as a constant, casual effect; even outside of combat, the daelkyr shifts between spaces, unbound by the concept of distance or time.</li>
            <li>The appearance of a daelkyr is subjective. The basic facts are constant: a daelkyr is a Medium bipedal creature, and its equipment doesn’t change. Beyond this, its appearance reflects its theme blended with its alien nature; for example, Valaara typically appears as an angelic humanoid merged with insect elements. But after people encounter a daelkyr, those who compare notes may find they disagree on the details. The daelkyr might appear as someone the viewer knows, or its appearance could shift mid-conversation. This is not something the daelkyr controls, and it’s not considered a beneficial trait; it’s simply part of their alien nature.</li>
            <li>Daelkyr have telepathy with a range of 120 feet. This is their primary form of communication and is intended to be broader in scope than typical telepathy. A daelkyr can communicate with any number of creatures within range at once, projecting a thought much as other creatures project sound. Typically when a daelkyr “speaks,” all creatures receive the same message, but the DM might decide that one or more creatures receive a different message. And just as people see different things when they look at a daelkyr, two people can perceive a daelkyr’s “speech” in very different ways. One may feel as though the daelkyr is speaking aloud with a strange, alien voice. Another may hear the speech of the daelkyr as the voice of a dead lover, whispering in their ear. Another may not be able to remember actually hearing the daelkyr speak; instead, they just remember its words existing, as if they’ve always known them.</li>
            <li>The Alien Mind feature of the daelkyr reflects the idea that the way that the daelkyr experience reality is so alien that any creature who tries to read their thoughts—to see the universe as they do—may become catatonic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any encounter with a daelkyr should be horrifying, driven by its alien, unknowable nature. The actions of the Lords of Dust and the Dreaming Dark make sense; the quori seek to control humanity’s dreams, while the Lords of Dust strive to release their bound overlords. The actions of the daelkyr are just as deadly and destructive, but we cannot understand what they want, and those who attempt to do so often become cultists.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Valaara</h3>

    <p>Valaara is known as the Crawling Queen, the Watcher in the Walls, and the Keeper of Worms. It’s said that you can hear Valaara’s voice in the rustling of roaches and the keening of locusts. In some tales, Valaara crafts worms that crawl through the ear and consume a creature’s brain; in others, when its maggots devour a corpse, Valaara can recreate the victim in its Deepest Hive. No one knows what Valaara wants, but its minions could be all around you even now, crawling in your walls and moving beneath your feet.</p>
    <p>Chitin Consciousness. Valaara embodies the alien nature of insects in all aspects. Valaara’s symbionts may be formed from chitin, but it also has creations like the Spellburrow and the Throwing Scarab (detailed in chapter 7)—insects that burrow into the skin of the bearer. Those touched by Valaara may undergo a physical metamorphosis and manifest insect traits, but Valaara’s touch can also transform the mind. Some who hear the whispers of the Crawling Queen become fascinated by insects, while others suffer more dramatic transformations. Valaara’s most persistent cults spread by forming a hive; one creature becomes the queen, and others touched by this cultist find their original personality and desires fading, consumed by the need to fulfill their purpose in the hive. Usually this effect is limited, a psychic connection that only binds a few people; but in a few cases, this psychic contagion has been virulent and contagious, consuming entire towns.</p>
    <p>Valaara’s Minions. The cults of the Crawling Queen are described in detail in chapter 3. Valaara doesn’t use dolgaunts or dolgrims; rather, it often transforms humanoids into insect forms. These creatures use the statistics of Thri-kreen, Driders, or Umber Hulks, but their appearance can vary dramatically; a group of servitors could be roach-people as opposed to the typical mantis form of the thri-kreen. In other places it works through consuming worms, producing creatures with the statistics of Spawn of Kyuss. In general, Valaara may employ any sort of creature thematically related to insects or worms, from simple swarms and Giant Spiders to Carrion Crawlers, Ankhegs, Remorhazes, or even Purple Worms. But these monsters should be seen as a starting point. Like all daelkyr, Valaara is constantly experimenting and creating new things. Imagine a purple worm with malign intelligence and psychic powers, or teleporting ankhegs that burrow through the fabric of space.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Valaara&apos;s Lair</h4>

    <p>Like other daelkyr, Valaara is bound within a demiplane in Khyber. However, Valaara has bred burrowing worms that chew through the fabric of reality, carving a web of passages between her Deepest Hive and the world above. An organization that discovers the upper layers of these tunnels could use them to move swiftly across the world, entering a tunnel in the Lhazaar Principalities, traveling five miles, and emerging in Sarlona or the Eldeen Reaches. Smugglers or explorers might make use of this wonder, never knowing what lies in the deeper tunnels—until Valaara’s minions seize them, or until they are consumed by the psychic influence of the Crawling Queen. While tunnels to the Deepest Hive can appear anywhere that suits the story, they are also less permanent than the ties between Eberron and the realms of many other daelkyr. A tunnel to the Deepest Hive can appear wherever it suits the needs of a story, but it’s also possible to collapse a passage and break a connection.</p>
    <p>The upper tunnels of Valaara’s realm are usually formed of fused glass-like material, then as explorers delve deeper, they find the walls formed of chitin and muscle, with insects swarming across every surface. One might discover pulsing cocoons, nests of slumbering purple worms, or chambers lined with thousands of glowing eggs. And in the heart is the Deepest Hive itself, where Valaara weaves its webs and conducts its sinister experiments.</p>
    <p>Tunnels to the Deepest Hive can appear anywhere. A region containing a passage to the Deepest Hive can be warped in one or more of these ways:</p>
    <p>Creeping Thoughts. The area within 1 mile of the passage is infested with swarms of harmless insects. Whenever a creature other than Valaara or one of its allies finishes a Long Rest in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from temporary delusions (see “Delusions of Valaara” below).</p>
    <p>Swarming Tyrant. Beasts that live within a mile of the passage undergo physical transformation, developing insect characteristics such as compound eyes, extra limbs, chitinous plating, and hive behavior. Valaara exerts its dominance over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1 mile of the passage have the Charmed condition while in that area.</p>
    <p>These regional effects build over time. If a passage has just appeared, there may be a slight increase in insect activity and the saving throw on the Delusions effect will be much lower. The longer the passage remains, the more notable the effects become. If Valaara dies or if the passage is destroyed, the effects fade away after 1d10 days.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Delusions of Valaara</h4>

    <p>If a creature falls prey to Valaara’s influence, it suffers temporary delusions. Roll on the Delusions of Valaara table to determine the nature of this effect, which takes the form of a curse that lasts until the creature is targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Fey Rulers</h2>

    <p>The fey emanate from Thelanis. The least among them embody the magic we wish to see in the world—the idea of spirits in the trees and wind, of mischievous sprites and satyrs dancing in the glades. The greatest are the archfey, immortals of story who rule domains within Thelanis. This section presents two such rulers: the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Forest Queen</h3>

    <p>There was a time when the world was the wood, when there were no towns or steel. The Forest Queen ruled the Endless Weald, maintaining peace between people and beasts. But as ages passed, her children grew restless in the shade of her leaves. Her eldest son came to her and said, “Mother, I dream of war! I want to build a fortress and wield a blade of steel.” The Queen replied, “Then leave the wood, but do not bring your metal into my domain.” And so he left the wood and founded the kingdom of Karrnath. The next day the eldest daughter came before the Queen. “Mother, I dream of magic! I want to build a tower and conjure fire!” The Queen replied, “Then leave the wood, but do not cast your spells in my domain.” And so she left the wood and founded the kingdom of Thaliost. One by one, the Queen’s children left her, until she was alone in the woods with the spirits and the beasts. And as each child raised a kingdom, the woods grew smaller and farther apart, and the heart of the Forest Queen grew bitter and cold. The people are her great-grandchildren, and she will not harm those who stay on the path and respect the beasts of the forest. But those who stray from the path, who conjure fire or hunt with steel, those fools will be lost in the Endless Weald and never again see the light of day.</p>
    <p>From the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches to the Harrowcrowns of Thrane, from the Greenhaunt of Breland to the Shadowmount Forest of Karrnath, wherever people dwell by the deep forest, they share stories of the Forest Queen. She is the archdryad, linked to every root and bough. She is proud, and when protecting her subjects, she can be ruthless; but she shares many wonders with those who enter her woods with empty hands and open eyes. The story above is clearly apocryphal, but it’s a common tale with many variations, such as her children founding nearby towns instead of nations. Regardless, the message is the same: there is a power that watches over the woods. Stories often depend on the character of the local forest; near the Towering Woods, the Forest Queen is often depicted as benevolent, while near the Nightwood of Karrnath, they talk of how the betrayals of her children froze the heart of the Forest Queen, leaving her cruel and hungry for revenge.</p>
    <p>The Queen of Weald and Wood. The Forest Queen rules the Endless Weald within Thelanis, an arboreal realm inhabited by dire beasts and wild fey. The Weald often leaks into the world through manifest zones found in deep forests; in such places, dryads lurk in the trees and beasts may possess unusual cunning. Under the right circumstances, travelers passing through a zone might even slip into the Weald. Such forests typically have well-worn paths that avoid these pitfalls, thus strengthening the story of stay on the path. The Greensinger druids know rituals to connect a forest to the Endless Weald, establishing a temporary manifest zone in any deep wood. The Queen’s influence can also be felt in any forest in times when Eberron and Thelanis are coterminous. Just like the stories, the Queen’s personality often reflects the forest where she’s currently manifesting; the Forest Queen is more likely to be benevolent in the Twilight Demesne and cruel in the Nightwood.</p>
    <p>The Queen as Ally or Patron. The Forest Queen has close ties to the Greensingers, and any Greensinger Druid or Ranger could have the Forest Queen as a patron. She’s an option for a Warlock with an Archfey Patron, but the magic she teaches is primal in nature, not arcane. This doesn’t change the spells available to the Warlock; their spells simply draw on elemental forces and the power of the fey rather than arcane formulas. As a more exotic option, a character with the Guide background could have slipped into the Endless Weald as a child and been raised in the court of the Forest Queen.</p>
    <p>Regardless of origin, any character allied with the Forest Queen is expected to follow her rules.</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Don’t use weapons or armor of metal.</li>
            <li>Don’t kill a natural beast with magic or for sport.</li>
            <li>Protect those who travel on a marked path, unless they harm the forest with their actions.</li>
            <li>Help any fey of the forest who comes to you in need.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond these basic principles, the Forest Queen’s quests typically relate to the woods in some way. An agent of the Forest Queen could be tasked to reconsecrate a grove, to destroy an infestation of aberrations or other unnatural predators, or to prevent an ambitious dragonmarked house from expanding into woodlands. Beyond the forest, an agent could be tasked to recover a relic stolen from the Endless Weald (and once reclaimed, perhaps entrusted to carry this artifact on their adventures). Agents of the Forest Queen might be charged to act as envoys, negotiating with agents of other archfey or dealing with the Feyspires. Or perhaps there’s a darkness in the Endless Weald, a canker that appeared when the forests of Cyre were consumed by the Mourning. The Forest Queen could task mortals to explore this region within the Weald, or charge them to explore the Mournland and to seek a cure for the wounded land.</p>
    <p>The Queen as an Enemy. One could make an enemy of the Queen by breaking one of her rules while in her woods, or perhaps by killing one of her favored beasts or devoted agents. Such a personal enmity could lead to a character being targeted by natural threats—singled out by aggressive beasts, led astray on journeys through wild regions, or targeted by malicious sprites. A character could also earn her ire by taking one of her relics from a forest, perhaps not knowing that the magic item is tied to the wood. On a larger scale, the Forest Queen could grow tired of civilization itself. The forests containing her manifest zones could expand, with fey and feral beasts attacking villages and towns as they’re overgrown. Could adventurers find a way to placate the bitter Queen, or must they defeat her to end this advance?</p>
    <p>Weapons of Wood and Bone</p>
    <p>The Forest Queen charges those who follow her rules to never kill with steel or wear metal armor. This can be a serious limitation for a Ranger or other character that has access to Martial weapons or Medium or Heavy armor. However, they could seek out equipment of bronzewood, an exotic lumber that only grows in Aerenal and in a few groves hidden deep in the Towering Wood. This exceptionally dense wood can be used to fashion armor without metal, which could use the same statistics as any Medium or Heavy armor. Arrows and Crossbow Bolts can also be fashioned from bronzewood, and this exceptionally durable ammunition breaks no more often than its steel counterpart. Similarly, Leafweave Armor is made from alchemically treated leaves of the bronzewood tree, and can offer the same level of protection as Studded Leather or a Chain Shirt.</p>
    <p>Armor and weapons made using these substances are generally only available in Aerenal or within the Towering Woods, but if it fits a character’s background, the DM could choose to allow a character’s starting equipment to be made from such materials. Another option is a weapon formed from the bones of a monstrosity; here again, the principle is that the weapon is mechanically identical to a standard weapon, but doesn’t violate the Forest Queen’s ban on metal. If a character is using a bone weapon, there should certainly be a story to it: What creature is it from? Who killed the beast and shaped the weapon, and how did the character come by it?</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">The Forgotten Prince</h3>

    <p>Once there was a prince of a grand kingdom, the youngest of eight sons. His brothers were celebrated as heroes of the realm, but whatever the youngest prince did, his deeds were never noticed; the shadows cast by his brothers were too long. Even when he saved the kingdom from a cruel dragon, the people assumed one of his brothers had done the deed. But in that dragon’s lair, the prince discovered a strange sack. Reaching inside it, he found a toy he’d loved as a child and long forgotten about, a comb lost by his sister, and a map of a nation that no longer exists. Curious, he climbed into the sack and found a castle within it, filled with forgotten wonders. No one ever noticed he was gone, and no one remembers his name or his deeds. But the Forgotten Prince still dwells in his Castle of Lost Things. When you forget something you love, or when something you need is nowhere to be found, it’s because the Forgotten Prince has taken it for his hoard.</p>
    <p>When a sock goes missing or a tool is misplaced, people curse the Forgotten Prince for stealing it away. When someone forgets what they were about to say, they might remark “The Prince has taken my thought.” Needless to say, his reach is not truly as wide as such stories make out; but the Forgotten Prince and his minions do indeed steal unappreciated things, both material items and even ideas themselves, keeping them in the vaults and library of his Castle of Lost Things. Often such thefts are never noticed, but he might take things that are quite valuable if he believes them to be unloved or unappreciated by those who have them. Sometimes this is done to teach a lesson, how the loss of a simple and undervalued item or idea can have disastrous consequences. Battles have been lost and cities fallen because of the Prince’s thefts—though often people fail to appreciate the lesson, as they never recall what was lost to begin with.</p>
    <p>The Prince of All Things Forgotten and Unloved. The Forgotten Prince dwells in the Castle of Lost Things in Thelanis. His attendants are sly and cunning fey, along with mortals who were unappreciated in their mundane lives. Some say that the kenku are servants of the Forgotten Prince who fled from his service—that he stole their voices as punishment for their betrayal, but that a kenku can earn it back with clever deeds. True or not, the Prince has followers scattered across Khorvaire—thieves who sacrifice unloved objects and undervalued secrets to the Prince in exchange for his guidance and gifts. Followers of the Forgotten Prince rarely work together, but they can be found in many positions of influence. There are elves in the Shadow Houses who receive visions from the Prince when they trance, and changelings among the Tyrants of Sharn who engage in more subtle thefts on behalf of the Prince, stealing hearts or faces. While his thefts often go unnoticed by the greater world, the Forgotten Prince also takes pleasure in seeing celebrated people whose reputations are undeserved brought low, and his agents may act to expose such poseurs. Adventurers could also be forced to deal with the Prince if he has something they need—perhaps an artifact or secret long forgotten, now sealed away in the vaults of his dark castle.</p>
    <p>The Prince as Ally or Patron. The Forgotten Prince may reach out to people who have themselves been forgotten or unappreciated, provided he sees potential in them. Sometimes he brings them to the Castle of Lost Things; in other cases, he offers these agents purpose, rewarding them for their service with gifts or secrets. The Wayfarer background is an excellent option for someone forgotten by the world but chosen by the Prince, while the Hermit background could reflect someone who spent much of their life in the Castle of Lost Things. The Forgotten Prince could be an Archfey Patron for a Warlock, or a Hexblade Warlock (from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) could also receive their weapon as a gift from the Prince; what is the forgotten history and destiny of this weapon? The Forgotten Prince can also be an interesting patron for a Bard of the College of Lore; the Prince values secrets no one else considers valuable, and the Cutting Words feature can be depicted as stealing opportunity from a foe—a trick taught by the Forgotten Prince. The Forgotten Prince could teach a Rogue the talents of an Arcane Trickster or the skills of a Thief, provided they are willing to use those skills on his behalf.</p>
    <p>Missions issued by the Prince typically involve the theft of an object or a secret. These things may not be seen as valuable by the people that possess them, and such a task could easily be added on top of the mission for an existing adventure—“While you’re in Dreadhold, steal the ring under the warden’s bed.” The Prince could teach his agents a ten-minute ritual which allows him to pull the requested item into Thelanis (this only works with objects the Prince wants, so it’s not a way to dispose of just any item). The Prince may also task agents with actions to expose or bring down people whose reputations are undeserved, or to assist those who are unappreciated. Note that good and evil don’t enter into these judgments; the Prince could call on agents to bring down someone who’s using their undeserved reputation for a good cause, or to help an unappreciated serial killer!</p>
    <p>The Prince as an Enemy. The simplest way for the Prince to enter a story is for one of his agents to steal something that the adventurers need, or to take actions that cripple an organization or patron that the characters work for. This ties to the idea that the Prince may target someone with an undeserved reputation even if they are using it to do good; the adventurers themselves could be targeted if they acquire fame that the Prince considers unearned. Or the characters might discover they need something stolen long ago by the Prince—or an object they’ve recently acquired and desperately need has gone missing, and no one else seems to remember it. Characters could also be set against the Prince by another immortal patron; perhaps the Prince has stolen one of the memories of the Forest Queen, and she wants it back.</p>
    <p>The Power of Secrets. A defining part of the Forgotten Prince’s story is that he himself has been forgotten. Should a character somehow learn the true name of the Forgotten Prince during their adventures, they have Advantage on saving throws against spells that he casts.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Forgotten Prince&apos;s Lair</h4>

    <p>The Prince dwells in the Castle of Forgotten Things in Thelanis. The castle seems to be its own distinct layer of Thelanis; if it exists in some other realm, its location has been forgotten. There are no doors that allow exit from the castle, and all the windows are sealed and show scenes of places that have been forgotten. The only way to enter or leave the castle is through magic, whether by spell, through a manifest zone, or through a portal. Such portals can take many forms, such as the sack described in the legend above; normal people forget the location of a portal within an hour of discovering it, though player characters and other remarkable people could be immune to this effect. It’s possible characters could discover that what they assumed to be a normal Bag of Holding can serve as a portal to the Castle of Lost Things.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Meld</h2>

    <p>A meld is formed from the faded souls of mortals—husks whose memories have been consumed by Dolurrh. These husks are typically harmless, but sometimes an aggressive nucleus gathers other husks, forming a deadly gestalt. In essence, a meld is a fusion of half-formed ghosts; it has an amorphous shape, with vague faces and limbs projecting from the mass, then being consumed once more. It makes no sound when it moves, but mortals around a meld hear cries of pain, pleading voices, and unearthly moans. Its Conflicted Soul action reflects it projecting some of its husks into a mortal body, temporarily overwhelming the victim with conflicting desires and visions.</p>
    <p>Denizens of Dolurrh. Melds are born in Dolurrh, and prowl the endless caverns searching for scraps of memory. This hunger can draw them to Eberron through manifest zones or when planes are coterminous. A meld can also manifest when someone is raised from the dead, following in the wake of the soul being drawn back to the world of the living. Melds that enter Eberron rarely stray more than a mile from the point where they arrived.</p>
    <p>Hunger for Memory. A meld has the barest traces of dozens of souls. It remembers scraps of the most powerful moments of its component husks, but it can’t place these in any context. The meld yearns to consume other spirits, to feast on their memories and emotions. While highly unusual, it’s possible for a powerful personality within a meld to exert temporary control; this might cause the meld to pursue a particular individual or draw it to a specific location. When a meld kills a living creature and consumes its spirit, the flood of memories can also shift the purpose of the meld, as it suddenly acts on the desires of its most recent victim. A meld loose in Eberron retains the spirits it consumes, preventing them from transitioning to Dolurrh. This prevents the spirit from fading; a character could hear the whispers of a trapped spirit within a meld, and a meld could hold the souls of people who died long ago. A side effect of this is that creatures slain by a meld cannot be resurrected or raised from the dead until the meld is destroyed.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Merfolk</h2>

    <p>Touched by Lamannia, the merfolk of the Thunder Sea have a deep connection to primal forces and planar power. The merfolk shepherd underwater manifest zones, and many can channel druidic magic. At the DM’s discretion, merfolk encountered in the Thunder Sea could know a cantrip from the Druid spell list.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Merfolk Stormcaller</h3>

    <p>A stormcaller feels the flow of the tides around, currents below, and shifting storms above the water, and can direct this power against those who threaten their people. Working together, a circle of stormcallers can bring down an entire fleet of ships. The greatest stormcallers have powers beyond what’s shown here; the merfolk tell stories of stormcallers who can command the beasts of the sea and transform into mighty squids or whales.</p>
    <p>Wardens of the Water. Most stormcallers seek to maintain balance within their realm. Like the Wardens of the Wood, they strive to protect their region from outside threats, but also to protect foolish outsiders from the dangers of the deeps and the manifest zones the stormcallers guard. However, there are stormcallers who view any intrusion into their waters as an affront that must be punished.</p>
    <p>Druidic Speech. Stormcallers know the Druidic language, which they believe to be the language of the world itself. Most stormcallers will parley with any creature who speaks Druidic, but they have high expectations of such beings. A stormcaller may ask a foreign druid to help with an unnatural threat or to serve as a mediator in a local dispute.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Quori</h2>

    <p>The quori are the spirits that rule Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. Quori are immortal, but they can be slain; when a quori dies, its essence returns to the Dreaming Dark, where it is reconstituted as a new spirit. Quori spirits are bound to emotions, and they feed on those emotions and excel at manipulating them in mortals. The tsucora thrive on fear, the hashalaq manipulate pleasure, the du’ulora are driven by anger, and the kalaraq consume pride and ambition. These are the most common quori, but there are many others; the spiteful tsoreva and the domineering usvapna have already been mentioned in previous editions.</p>
    <p>The quori are the creations of il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that shapes Dal Quor. Cruelty is a part of their nature. However, when a quori is reborn, there is a microscopic chance that it will be touched by il-Yannah, the incarnation of light that will one day replace the Dreaming Dark. It’s possible for a quori to carry this seed of light and never embrace it. The kalaraq Taratai was the first to rally those quori who could sense the light, teaching them to push back the darkness and embrace il-Yannah. These rebels are the spirits who are now bound to the kalashtar. They are still quori—tsucora, hashalaq, du’ulora, kalaraq—and they are still tied to the emotion associated with their quori type. But they are driven by their vision of the light that is to come rather than the darkness of the present. Taratai’s rebels fled Dal Quor long ago, and there have surely been new quori touched by il-Yannah since then. But today, the Dreaming Dark are constantly policing their own ranks and searching for such “corrupted” spirits. Any that are found will be destroyed, so their spirits can be reborn as proper servants of il-Lashtavar.</p>
    <p>All quori have powerful psionic abilities. DMs could choose to represent this by granting each quori from Eberron: Rising from the Last War telepathy with a range of 120 feet. If a quori has any Inspired hosts, as do all that interact with the Material Plane, it would also speak the Riedran language.</p>
    <p>Quori: Fiends or Aberrations</p>
    <p>Quori aren’t biological creatures. They’re immortal spirits, fragments of nightmare spawned by il-Lashtavar. They don’t sleep, and they dine only on the emotions of mortals. They are known for their ability to possess other mortals, a reflection of their fundamentally spiritual nature. All of these make them quite different from creatures such as beholders or mind flayers—monsters that are deeply alien, but that are still formed of flesh and blood.</p>
    <p>The choice to classify quori as Aberrations in fifth edition reflects the idea that “aberration” is a broad category including any entity that is fundamentally alien; and certainly, the quori have no place in the natural world. However, this has a number of concrete mechanical effects. Many effects that target evil spirits only affect Fiends and Undead. As Aberrations, quori can’t be detected by a Paladin’s Divine Sense or banished to Dal Quor with Divine Word. The Hallow and Forbiddance spells don’t protect against them. This was an intentional decision that renders quori immune to many of the tools that can be deployed against devils or demons. However, as a DM, you can choose to make quori Fiends instead of Aberrations if you want these spells and effects to be effective against them. Or you could compromise by leaving quori as Aberrations, but say that Clerics and Paladins devoted to the Path of Light can affect quori with any spell or class feature that affects Fiends. This keeps quori as mysterious and alien, and gives the Path of Light a unique role in battling them.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Du&apos;ulora Quori</h3>

    <p>Du’ulora are spirits of fury that feed on anger and inspire rage in mortals. A du’ulora is a maelstrom of eyes and wings, bound together by flesh that seems like solidified shadow. It can extend up to three tentacles from this dark mass. A du’ulora can turn a victim’s anger into manifested heat; in battle, it grapples its victims and burns them with their own fury.</p>
    <p>Manipulating Fury. While they feed on anger and hatred, du’ulora rarely act rashly. They are cunning and calculating strategists who excel at inspiring fury in others and turning it against them. In battle this can cause their victims to lower their guard and even to strike their own allies in heedless rage. As servants of the Dreaming Dark, the du’ulora craft dreams that stir buried anger and incite hatred; they excel at igniting feuds and inspiring vendettas. So where a tsucora agent of the Dreaming Dark manipulates peoples’ fears and a hashalaq employs seduction, the du’ulora excel at inciting violence.</p>
    <p>The Fists of Dal Quor. The du’ulora are martial champions of the quori. They thrive on conflict and love to personally crush their enemies. While they enjoy fighting in the vanguard, the du’ulora are also skilled strategists. In Dal Quor, the du’ulora command squads of tsucora and lesser quori. In Riedra, military commanders are typically Inspired bound to du’ulora spirits.</p>
    <p>Rage Against The Darkness. The du’ulora bound to the kalashtar serve the light, but they still manipulate fury. Du’ulora kalashtar learn to harness and channel their own aggression, and are often Fighters or Barbarians; others are dispassionate Monks, who provoke rage in their enemies while never allowing it to distract them from their goals.</p>
    <p>Variant Inspired: Quori Vessel</p>
    <p>As described in chapter 6 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War, an Inspired gains benefits based on the type of quori possessing it.</p>
    <p>Du&apos;ulora</p>
    <p>All-Around Vision. The Inspired can’t be surprised.</p>
    <p>Enemies Abound (1/Day). The Inspired can cast the Enemies &#9;Abound spell (spell save DC 13).</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr">Sahuagin</h2>

    <p>The sahuagin dominate the Thunder Sea. Proud and predatory, the sahuagin see the creatures of the surface world as primitive and weak. The sahuagin are generally content to ignore the lesser creatures that dwell above the water, but when there is blood in the water, they are implacable and deadly foes. Through magebreeding and induced mutation they have created a host of terrors, such as the duplicitous malenti, the four-armed Sahuagin Barons, the shape-shifting Plasmids, and the terrifying Sahuagin Claws of Sha’argon.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Claw of Sha&apos;argon</h3>

    <p>The aboleths created the lobster-like chuuls as living weapons and unleashed them against the sahuagin. The high priests of the Eternal Dominion responded by consuming the chuuls and taking their power. A Claw of Sha’argon is a mighty sahuagin champion—an armored powerhouse possessing deep faith and wielding divine power. While barons lead sahuagin into battle, the Claws of Sha’argon are the spiritual leaders of the Eternal Dominion who lead its inquisitions and crush its enemies with claw and spell.</p>
    <p>Claw and Tentacle. The powerful claws of a sahuagin priest are deadly weapons. It manipulates objects and casts spells using its facial tentacles. These tentacles are fully prehensile limbs capable of delicate work, but a Claw of Sha’argon has Disadvantage on Strength checks made using its tentacles.</p>
    <p>Devoted Priests. Only the greatest spiritual leaders of the sahuagin are nominated for the ritual that produces a Claw of Sha’argon, and only those possessing the most unshakable faith survive this agonizing process. The Claws of Sha’argon see themselves as chosen vessels of the Devourer, channeling the fury of the wild. A Claw of Sha’argon casts spells as an 11th-level spellcaster, and those spells listed are typical for a Claw of Sha’argon, but can be replaced with any spell available to a Tempest Cleric (from the 2014 Player’s Handbook).</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Plasmid</h3>

    <p>Plasmids are shape-shifters, magebred by the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea using mimic stock infused with the ichor of the dreamers. Plasmids serve both as deadly guardians and living tools, reshaping their mutable bodies to serve the needs of their sahuagin masters.</p>
    <p>Skin of Stone and Steel. A plasmid can change the texture of its flesh as well as its appearance. In addition to making the plasmid resistant to injury, this allows the creature to assume many functional forms. A plasmid can serve as a door with no lock or a chest with no lid, creating an obstacle that can only be opened by killing the plasmid. Plasmids can also be trained to assume shapes that serve as functional tools. A plasmid can become an alchemist’s lab or a smith’s forge, providing all the elements needed to pursue a trade. While this allows the plasmid to “serve as a tool,” the plasmid remains a Large creature; it essentially becomes a workbench, with individual smaller tools connected to the primary mass by fibrous strands.</p>
    <p>Loyal Servants... For Now. Plasmids possess a passive form of telepathy that allows them to sense the commands of nearby sahuagin. While they are conscious, they have a limited sense of self and no desires beyond service. At least, that’s how they were designed and what the sahuagin believe. But it might be possible for a plasmid to develop greater intellect and independence—or for the plasmids of a city to be shaped by the desires of the local dreamer.</p>

    <p>Magic Resistance. Valaara has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
    <p>Regeneration. Valaara regains 20 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. If Valaara takes Radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function on Valaara’s next turn. Valaara dies only if it starts its turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn’t regenerate.</p>

    <p>Summon Swarms. Valaara summons a swarm of insects or arachnids that fills a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point Valaara can see within 120 feet, afflicting all creatures in the area with one of the following effects (roll a 1d6 or choose one), to which Valaara is immune:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>Stinging Wasps. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 22. Failure: 32 (5d12) Piercing damage, and the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. Success: Half damage and the target doesn’t have Disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
            <li>Spinning Spiders. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 22. Failure: 27 (6d8) Bludgeoning damage. The target has the Restrained condition until the web is destroyed (AC 10; HP 5; Vulnerability to Fire damage; Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage).</li>
            <li>Venomous Centipedes. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 22. Failure: 22 (4d10) Poison damage and the target has the Poisoned condition. It repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.</li>

Failure: The target is infested by 4 (1d4 + 2) rot grubs, taking 3 (1d6) Piercing damage per rot grub at the start of each of its turns. If a target infested with rot grubs ends its turn with 0 Hit Points, the rot grubs burrow into its heart, killing it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target, ending the effect. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the creature’s next turn deals 1 Fire damage to the creature and kills the rot grubs, ending the effect. After this time, the rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned.</li>
            <li>Discordant Cicadas. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 22. Failure: The target has the Frightened condition. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

    <p>Magic Resistance. The quori has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
    <p>Track Hatred. When the quori deals damage to any creature, it forms a psychic link with the target for 24 hours. During that time, the quori has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target. The quori can attempt to track the target at any range, even if it is on another plane of existence. Abilities such as the Pass Without Trace spell or the Ranger’s Nature’s Veil feature do not impede the quori’s ability to track its target.

The quori’s game statistics are the same, except it uses the possessed target’s Speed, as well as the target’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers. <br/> The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit Points or the quori leaves as a Bonus Action. When the possession ends, the quori appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target, and the target is immune to this quori’s Possession for 24 hours. <br/> Success: The target is immune to this quori’s Possession for 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Recall Agony (Recharge 5–6). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 16, one creature the quori can see within 60 feet. Failure: 67 (15d8) Psychic damage. Success: Half damage.</p>
