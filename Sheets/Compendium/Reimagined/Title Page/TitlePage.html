            <p class="rthw-drop-cap">At the unfathomable edge of the Shadowfell lie the Domains of Dread, realms bound by Mists where magic and reality twist into nightmare. This chapter for DMs explores the most terrifying of the Domains of Dread. Among other tools, each featured domain includes the following details:</p>
            <p><strong>Domain.</strong> This initial section introduces the domain, its unique horrors, and notable locations.</p>
            <p><strong>Darklord.</strong> The domain’s Darklord, their stat block, effects they create within their domain, how they close their domain’s borders (see the introduction), and details of their lair appear here.</p>
            <p><strong>Adventures.</strong> This section provides guidance on creating adventures in the domain, a campaign outline, and short adventures.</p>
            <p>This chapter concludes with an overview of additional domains.</p>
            <h2 class="compendium-hr">Tarokka and the Mists</h2>
            <p>Tarokka fortune-telling cards (detailed in the appendix) have special relationships with domains and their Darklords.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Tarokka Mist Talismans</h3>
            <p>Each Domain of Dread is aligned with a tarokka card. A character with a tarokka deck can use it to travel between domains. While in the Mists, the deck’s bearer can draw a random card from the deck; that card serves as a Mist talisman (see the introduction), allowing travel to the domain it is aligned with. A tarokka deck can be used in this way once every 24 hours. A list of domains and their aligned tarokka cards appears at the end of this chapter.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Darklords and the Tarokka</h3>
            <p>Every Domain of Dread has a tarokka card that opposes it—one hinting at the truth of the domain’s Darklord. If a domain’s opposed tarokka card is drawn during a tarokka reading in that domain, that domain’s Darklord becomes aware of the reading and its participants. When this occurs, the Darklord can choose to see through the eyes of the tarokka user and speak through them for 1 minute. The Darklord might make their presence known, level a threat, or misinterpret the cards. A tarokka reader has no memory of what a Darklord uses them to say.</p>

            <h2>First of the Darklords </h2>
            <p>Count Strahd von Zarovich has lost all he ever desired—over and over again. Tormented by the Dark Powers, Strahd is haunted by visions of his lost family and tarnished nobility. The count spends long years brooding in the depths of Castle Ravenloft, but a reincarnation of his obsession appears every generation: Tatyana. Each time Tatyana’s reincarnation emerges, Strahd seeks to undo the failures of his past and find a way to win her love. Time and time again, Strahd’s heartless, domineering nature causes his bloody history to repeat itself and drives Tatyana beyond his clutches.</p>
            <p>A severe, aristocratic figure, the count has the bearing of a former soldier and the impatience of one used to being obeyed. He feels little but occasionally embraces the novelty of toying with amusing strangers or breaking the spirits of his enemies. During his unnaturally long existence, he has learned many occult secrets and mysteries of the Domains of Dread. Strahd’s dignified bearing crumbles when someone breaks his laws or denies him what he desires. In such cases, Strahd makes bloody examples of his opponents, drawing out his vengeance into campaigns of terror.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Tale</h3>
            <p>Count Strahd von Zarovich was a ruthless conqueror. Retiring after years of war, Strahd settled in the beautiful valley where he’d won his greatest victory. There, in the way of his ancestors, he spilled his blood into the earth, sealing a pact between himself and the land. In honor of his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia, he named the valley Barovia and constructed his home, Castle Ravenloft.</p>
            <p>Strahd invited his few remaining family members to live with him at Castle Ravenloft and eventually was joined by his younger brother, Sergei. Sergei was everything Strahd wasn’t—youthful, empathic, and warm. Soon after he arrived, the younger von Zarovich and a local villager named Tatyana fell in love. Strahd resented his brother, even more so after meeting Tatyana and being charmed by her pure kindness. Obsessed, Strahd sought to woo her but was rebuffed. Unwilling to accept her wishes or the idea of Sergei as his better, Strahd made a pact with ancient evil forces to regain his vitality and ensnare Tatyana’s heart.</p>
            <p>The day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding, Strahd murdered Sergei and, to seal his pact, drank his brother’s blood. He revealed his new might to Tatyana, expecting to enthrall her. Instead, horrified by Sergei’s murder, Tatyana fled Strahd, ultimately leaping from the height of Castle Ravenloft and vanishing into the Mists. At the same time, traitors from among the castle’s guards and wedding’s guests rose up to assassinate Strahd. Despite countless wounds, Strahd didn’t die. His bargain with the Dark Powers had made Strahd the multiverse’s first vampire. A night of slaughter followed; when dawn touched the parapets of Castle Ravenloft, no living soul survived within. But Strahd remained.</p>
            <p>Strahd’s villainy and his connection to his land drew all of Barovia into the grip of the Dark Powers, which transplanted the vampire and his realm into the Shadowfell. This began a succession of torments that plague the count still. The Dark Powers’ attentions have spilled forth to drag others into the Mists as well, giving rise to the Domains of Dread.</p>
         <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Domain</h3>
            <p>Barovia is altered by Strahd’s presence, creating the following effects:</p>
            <p><strong>Closing the Borders.</strong> While in his domain, Strahd can close or open the borders to Barovia at will. While the borders are closed, noxious fog suffuses the Mists surrounding Barovia. A creature that enters the Mists for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. A creature makes this save only once per turn.</p>
            <p><strong>Dreadful Darkness.</strong> While in an area of Darkness, creatures other than Strahd and creatures of his choice have Disadvantage on saving throws to end or avoid the Frightened condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Jealous Heart.</strong> When a character receives Heroic Inspiration but already has it, that character can’t give it to another character in the group.</p>
            <p>If Strahd dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Lairs</h3>
            <p>While the notorious Castle Ravenloft is Strahd’s home, it isn’t his only redoubt in Barovia. Multiple bastions of evil serve as sanctuaries for the count and his servants, should fate demand. </p>

            <p><strong><em>Darklord Restoration.</em></strong> If Strahd dies, he revives with all his Hit Points in 1d10 weeks somewhere in Barovia.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Domain).</em></strong> If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Misty Escape.</em></strong> If Strahd drops to 0 Hit Points outside his resting place, he uses Shape-Shift to become mist (no action required). If he can’t use Shape-Shift, he is destroyed. While Strahd has 0 Hit Points in mist form, he can’t return to his vampire form, and he must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his resting place, Strahd returns to his vampire form and has the Paralyzed condition until he regains any Hit Points, and he regains 1 Hit Point after spending 1 hour there.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Strahd can climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without making an ability check.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Vampire Weakness.</em></strong> Strahd has these weaknesses:</p>
            <ul class="list--hidden">
            <li><strong>Forbiddance.</strong> Strahd can’t enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.</li>
            <li><strong>Running Water.</strong> Strahd takes 20 Acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.</li>
            <li><strong>Stake to the Heart.</strong> If a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into Strahd’s heart while Strahd has the Incapacitated condition in his resting place, Strahd has the Paralyzed condition until the weapon is removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight.</strong> Strahd takes 20 Radiant damage if he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="monster-header">Actions</p>
            <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Strahd makes two Death Strike attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with a use of (A) Bite or (B) Spellcasting to cast [spells]Fireball[/spells] if available.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Death Strike.</em></strong> <em>Melee Attack Roll:</em> +9, reach 5 ft. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) Slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14) from one of two hands.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Constitution Saving Throw:</em> DC 17, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained condition. <em>Failure:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage. The target’s Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains Hit Points equal to that amount. A Humanoid reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage rises the following night as a Vampire Spawn under Strahd’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> Strahd casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):</p>
            <p><strong>At Will:</strong> [spells]Detect Thoughts[/spells], [spells]Fog Cloud[/spells], [spells]Mage Hand[/spells]</p>
            <p><strong>2/Day Each:</strong> [spells]Animate Dead[/spells], [spells]Fireball[/spells], [spells]Gust of Wind[/spells], [spells]Mirror Image[/spells], [spells]Nondetection[/spells]</p>
            <p><strong>1/Day Each:</strong> [spells]Greater Invisibility[/spells], [spells]Polymorph[/spells], [spells]Scrying[/spells]</p>
            <p class="monster-header">Bonus Actions</p>
            <p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> Strahd casts [spells]Charm Person[/spells], requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting. When the spell is cast this way, its duration is 24 hours, and the Charmed target is a willing recipient of Strahd’s Bite, the damage of which doesn’t end the spell. When the spell ends, the target is unaware it was Charmed by Strahd.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Shape-Shift.</em></strong> If Strahd isn’t in sunlight or running water, he shape-shifts into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 30 ft.), a Medium wolf (Speed 40 ft.), or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 20 ft. [hover]), or he returns to his vampire form. Anything he is wearing transforms with him.</p>
            <p>While in bat or wolf form, Strahd can’t speak. His game statistics, other than his size and Speed, are unchanged.</p>
            <p>While in mist form, Strahd can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless and can enter an enemy’s space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, Strahd can do so, but he can’t pass through liquid. Strahd has Resistance to all damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.</p>
            <p class="monster-header">Legendary Actions</p>
            <p class="legendary-actions">Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Domain). Immediately after another creature’s turn, Strahd can expend a use to take one of the following actions. Strahd regains all expended uses at the start of each of his turns.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Count’s Command.</em></strong> Strahd casts [spells]Command[/spells] (level 2 version), requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Striding Strike.</em></strong> Strahd moves up to half his Speed, and he makes one Death Strike attack.</p>

        <h2>Domain of the First Vampire</h2>
        <p><strong>Darklord:</strong> Strahd von Zarovich</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Gothic horror</p>
        <p><strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Undead despot, notorious haunted stronghold, tragic resurrection</p>
        <p><strong>Mist Talismans:</strong> Barovian wine bottle, von Zarovich crest, Mark of the Raven talisman</p>
        <p><strong>Aligned Tarokka Card</strong>: Darklord</p>
        <p><strong>Opposed Tarokka Card</strong>: Mists</p>
      </aside>
      <p>In Barovia, the night is a curse. As darkness falls, wicked souls slip from the spires of Castle Ravenloft to work the will of an immortal overlord. This is the realm of the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, whose depravities have doomed him and his land to endless cycles of obsession and despair.</p>
      <p>The howls of wolves and shrieks of ravens echo through the dismal valleys and oppressive forests of Barovia. In isolated communities, superstitious villagers find the brightness in their lives smothered by dread of their aloof overlord and other festering evils. These Barovians fear the night, as agents of the devil Strahd watch in the dark and claim whatever he desires. Yet few in Barovia realize their torments have played out again and again. In every generation, echoes of Strahd's past reemerge, compelling and confounding the Darklord as he endlessly obsesses over the one victim who's eluded him for centuries.</p>
      <h3 class="compendium-hr">Domain Features</h3>
      <p>Barovia is known for the following features:</p>
      <p><strong>The Devil Strahd.</strong> Few have seen Count von Zarovich, but all know he dwells in Castle Ravenloft, a citadel from which few visitors return. Strahd is infamous for viciously executing any who flagrantly break his laws, but otherwise he rarely interferes in the lives of his people. Some whisper that he is a vampire.</p>
      <p><strong>Haunted Tales.</strong> The stories of Barovia's people are full of hidden evils: accursed ruins, portentous ravens, secretive cults, treacherous witches, vicious werewolves, and worse.</p>
      <p><strong>Isolation and Suspicion.</strong> Barovia is a realm of wolf-prowled forests and treacherous mountains where the sun is obscured. The land's superstitious people live in scattered villages. They distrust strangers, fearing they're agents of the count.</p>
      <h3 class="compendium-hr">Locations in Barovia</h3>
      <p>Barovia is a land of long shadows where ancient wildernesses strangle the ruins of a near-forgotten empire. Mysteries pervade the domain, and those who leave the relative safety of Barovia's dismal settlements enter perilous lands where mortals aren't welcome.</p>
      <p>The village of Barovia is described below, and other notable locations are summarized on the Barovia Locations table.</p>
      <h4 class="compendium-hr">Village of Barovia</h4>
      <p>Lying in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, the village of Barovia teeters on the brink of ruin. Its few residents rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbors of wickedness and fearing evils in the night. Their dread is largely justified, as wolves, ghosts, and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by callousness or wicked temptations.</p>
      <p>A rare exception to the village's cold desperation can be found at the local tavern, the Blood of the Vine. Those few who oppose Strahd's evil congregate here&mdash;under the covert oversight of the count's agents.</p>
      <h4 class="compendium-hr">Castle Ravenloft</h4>
      <p>Castle Ravenloft is Strahd von Zarovich's accursed sanctuary. Tormented spirits and Strahd's minions haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes, reflecting some aspect of his depraved past, or protecting his coffin in the castle catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie throughout the count's home, some of which might hold the key to his undoing. The adventure <em>Curse of Strahd</em> details Castle Ravenloft.</p>
      <h4 class="compendium-hr">Von Zarovich Sanctuaries</h4>
      <p>Hidden across Barovia lie secret sanctuaries known only to Strahd and his servants. These crypt-like boltholes are hidden from the sun and exist primarily to shelter the count should he require. Over the centuries, Strahd has granted trusted servants access to some of these sanctuaries and used others in plots or experiments that he keeps distant from Castle Ravenloft. Still others Strahd has forgotten, allowing other evils to fester there. An example of one of these sites is depicted on map 2.2 and has the following features:</p>
      <p><strong>Count's Coffin.</strong> Hidden in each sanctuary lies a coffin bearing the von Zarovich crest. This might be obvious or in a space only accessible to vampires.</p>
      <p><strong>The Lord's Presence.</strong> Behind a vault-like iron door, an entry chamber holds a high-backed throne. Strahd forbids servants from using these symbols of his authority.</p>
      <p><strong>Servants' Space.</strong> Alcoves carved in the walls provide space for the coffins or bunks of Strahd's living or dead servants. Sometimes, the Darklord uses these spaces for arcane experiments or as makeshift prisons.</p>

        <p>The world of Faerûn is filled with countless heroes who have undertaken amazing adventures—Drizzt Do’Urden, his wife Cattie-brie, and their daughter, Briennelle; Alustriel Silverhand and the rest of the Seven Sisters; Karlach Cliffgate, Astarion, and Shadowheart; and many more. Now, the world has new heroes: the ones you and your fellow players create.</p>
        <p>Heroes in the Forgotten Realms are larger than life. Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn gives you everything you need to create adventurers that fit right into the Realms, including new and revised subclasses and dozens of new feats and spells.</p>
         <p>Like the heroes who populate Faerûn, magic in the Realms is epic. This book introduces the Faerûnian technique of circle magic: a way for spellcasters to work together to make their spells more flexible and powerful.</p>
         <p>Heroes seldom work alone. This book details eight famous factions, each of which has a reach that extends across all Faerûn. Some of these factions, like the Harpers or the Lords’ Alliance , are honorable and just, helping the needy and protecting the innocent. Others, like the greedy Zhentarim or the power-hungry Red Wizards , oppress their victims and focus on amassing power. Your character can join any of these factions, earning rewards for loyal service. Or, your character might oppose a faction and brave its ire.</p>
         <p>Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, a world of epic characters and adventures!</p>
