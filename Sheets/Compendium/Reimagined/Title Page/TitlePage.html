            <p class="rthw-drop-cap">At the unfathomable edge of the Shadowfell lie the Domains of Dread, realms bound by Mists where magic and reality twist into nightmare. This chapter for DMs explores the most terrifying of the Domains of Dread. Among other tools, each featured domain includes the following details:</p>
            <p><strong>Domain.</strong> This initial section introduces the domain, its unique horrors, and notable locations.</p>
            <p><strong>Darklord.</strong> The domain’s Darklord, their stat block, effects they create within their domain, how they close their domain’s borders (see the introduction), and details of their lair appear here.</p>
            <p><strong>Adventures.</strong> This section provides guidance on creating adventures in the domain, a campaign outline, and short adventures.</p>
            <p>This chapter concludes with an overview of additional domains.</p>
            <h2 class="compendium-hr">Tarokka and the Mists</h2>
            <p>Tarokka fortune-telling cards (detailed in the appendix) have special relationships with domains and their Darklords.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Tarokka Mist Talismans</h3>
            <p>Each Domain of Dread is aligned with a tarokka card. A character with a tarokka deck can use it to travel between domains. While in the Mists, the deck’s bearer can draw a random card from the deck; that card serves as a Mist talisman (see the introduction), allowing travel to the domain it is aligned with. A tarokka deck can be used in this way once every 24 hours. A list of domains and their aligned tarokka cards appears at the end of this chapter.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Darklords and the Tarokka</h3>
            <p>Every Domain of Dread has a tarokka card that opposes it—one hinting at the truth of the domain’s Darklord. If a domain’s opposed tarokka card is drawn during a tarokka reading in that domain, that domain’s Darklord becomes aware of the reading and its participants. When this occurs, the Darklord can choose to see through the eyes of the tarokka user and speak through them for 1 minute. The Darklord might make their presence known, level a threat, or misinterpret the cards. A tarokka reader has no memory of what a Darklord uses them to say.</p>

            <h2>First of the Darklords </h2>
            <p>Count Strahd von Zarovich has lost all he ever desired—over and over again. Tormented by the Dark Powers, Strahd is haunted by visions of his lost family and tarnished nobility. The count spends long years brooding in the depths of Castle Ravenloft, but a reincarnation of his obsession appears every generation: Tatyana. Each time Tatyana’s reincarnation emerges, Strahd seeks to undo the failures of his past and find a way to win her love. Time and time again, Strahd’s heartless, domineering nature causes his bloody history to repeat itself and drives Tatyana beyond his clutches.</p>
            <p>A severe, aristocratic figure, the count has the bearing of a former soldier and the impatience of one used to being obeyed. He feels little but occasionally embraces the novelty of toying with amusing strangers or breaking the spirits of his enemies. During his unnaturally long existence, he has learned many occult secrets and mysteries of the Domains of Dread. Strahd’s dignified bearing crumbles when someone breaks his laws or denies him what he desires. In such cases, Strahd makes bloody examples of his opponents, drawing out his vengeance into campaigns of terror.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Tale</h3>
            <p>Count Strahd von Zarovich was a ruthless conqueror. Retiring after years of war, Strahd settled in the beautiful valley where he’d won his greatest victory. There, in the way of his ancestors, he spilled his blood into the earth, sealing a pact between himself and the land. In honor of his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia, he named the valley Barovia and constructed his home, Castle Ravenloft.</p>
            <p>Strahd invited his few remaining family members to live with him at Castle Ravenloft and eventually was joined by his younger brother, Sergei. Sergei was everything Strahd wasn’t—youthful, empathic, and warm. Soon after he arrived, the younger von Zarovich and a local villager named Tatyana fell in love. Strahd resented his brother, even more so after meeting Tatyana and being charmed by her pure kindness. Obsessed, Strahd sought to woo her but was rebuffed. Unwilling to accept her wishes or the idea of Sergei as his better, Strahd made a pact with ancient evil forces to regain his vitality and ensnare Tatyana’s heart.</p>
            <p>The day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding, Strahd murdered Sergei and, to seal his pact, drank his brother’s blood. He revealed his new might to Tatyana, expecting to enthrall her. Instead, horrified by Sergei’s murder, Tatyana fled Strahd, ultimately leaping from the height of Castle Ravenloft and vanishing into the Mists. At the same time, traitors from among the castle’s guards and wedding’s guests rose up to assassinate Strahd. Despite countless wounds, Strahd didn’t die. His bargain with the Dark Powers had made Strahd the multiverse’s first vampire. A night of slaughter followed; when dawn touched the parapets of Castle Ravenloft, no living soul survived within. But Strahd remained.</p>
            <p>Strahd’s villainy and his connection to his land drew all of Barovia into the grip of the Dark Powers, which transplanted the vampire and his realm into the Shadowfell. This began a succession of torments that plague the count still. The Dark Powers’ attentions have spilled forth to drag others into the Mists as well, giving rise to the Domains of Dread.</p>
         <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Domain</h3>
            <p>Barovia is altered by Strahd’s presence, creating the following effects:</p>
            <p><strong>Closing the Borders.</strong> While in his domain, Strahd can close or open the borders to Barovia at will. While the borders are closed, noxious fog suffuses the Mists surrounding Barovia. A creature that enters the Mists for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. A creature makes this save only once per turn.</p>
            <p><strong>Dreadful Darkness.</strong> While in an area of Darkness, creatures other than Strahd and creatures of his choice have Disadvantage on saving throws to end or avoid the Frightened condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Jealous Heart.</strong> When a character receives Heroic Inspiration but already has it, that character can’t give it to another character in the group.</p>
            <p>If Strahd dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
            <h3 class="compendium-hr">Strahd’s Lairs</h3>
            <p>While the notorious Castle Ravenloft is Strahd’s home, it isn’t his only redoubt in Barovia. Multiple bastions of evil serve as sanctuaries for the count and his servants, should fate demand. </p>

            <p class="monster-header">Traits</p>
            <p><strong><em>Darklord Restoration.</em></strong> If Strahd dies, he revives with all his Hit Points in 1d10 weeks somewhere in Barovia.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Domain).</em></strong> If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Misty Escape.</em></strong> If Strahd drops to 0 Hit Points outside his resting place, he uses Shape-Shift to become mist (no action required). If he can’t use Shape-Shift, he is destroyed. While Strahd has 0 Hit Points in mist form, he can’t return to his vampire form, and he must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his resting place, Strahd returns to his vampire form and has the Paralyzed condition until he regains any Hit Points, and he regains 1 Hit Point after spending 1 hour there.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Strahd can climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without making an ability check.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Vampire Weakness.</em></strong> Strahd has these weaknesses:</p>
            <ul class="list--hidden">
            <li><strong>Forbiddance.</strong> Strahd can’t enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.</li>
            <li><strong>Running Water.</strong> Strahd takes 20 Acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.</li>
            <li><strong>Stake to the Heart.</strong> If a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into Strahd’s heart while Strahd has the Incapacitated condition in his resting place, Strahd has the Paralyzed condition until the weapon is removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight.</strong> Strahd takes 20 Radiant damage if he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="monster-header">Actions</p>
            <p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Strahd makes two Death Strike attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with a use of (A) Bite or (B) Spellcasting to cast [spells]Fireball[/spells] if available.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Death Strike.</em></strong> <em>Melee Attack Roll:</em> +9, reach 5 ft. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) Slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14) from one of two hands.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Constitution Saving Throw:</em> DC 17, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained condition. <em>Failure:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage. The target’s Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains Hit Points equal to that amount. A Humanoid reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage rises the following night as a Vampire Spawn under Strahd’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> Strahd casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):</p>
            <p><strong>At Will:</strong> [spells]Detect Thoughts[/spells], [spells]Fog Cloud[/spells], [spells]Mage Hand[/spells]</p>
            <p><strong>2/Day Each:</strong> [spells]Animate Dead[/spells], [spells]Fireball[/spells], [spells]Gust of Wind[/spells], [spells]Mirror Image[/spells], [spells]Nondetection[/spells]</p>
            <p><strong>1/Day Each:</strong> [spells]Greater Invisibility[/spells], [spells]Polymorph[/spells], [spells]Scrying[/spells]</p>
            <p class="monster-header">Bonus Actions</p>
            <p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> Strahd casts [spells]Charm Person[/spells], requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting. When the spell is cast this way, its duration is 24 hours, and the Charmed target is a willing recipient of Strahd’s Bite, the damage of which doesn’t end the spell. When the spell ends, the target is unaware it was Charmed by Strahd.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Shape-Shift.</em></strong> If Strahd isn’t in sunlight or running water, he shape-shifts into a Tiny bat (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 30 ft.), a Medium wolf (Speed 40 ft.), or a Medium cloud of mist (Speed 5 ft., Fly Speed 20 ft. [hover]), or he returns to his vampire form. Anything he is wearing transforms with him.</p>
            <p>While in bat or wolf form, Strahd can’t speak. His game statistics, other than his size and Speed, are unchanged.</p>
            <p>While in mist form, Strahd can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless and can enter an enemy’s space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, Strahd can do so, but he can’t pass through liquid. Strahd has Resistance to all damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.</p>
            <p class="monster-header">Legendary Actions</p>
            <p class="legendary-actions">Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Domain). Immediately after another creature’s turn, Strahd can expend a use to take one of the following actions. Strahd regains all expended uses at the start of each of his turns.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Count’s Command.</em></strong> Strahd casts [spells]Command[/spells] (level 2 version), requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Striding Strike.</em></strong> Strahd moves up to half his Speed, and he makes one Death Strike attack.</p>

        <p>The world of Faerûn is filled with countless heroes who have undertaken amazing adventures—Drizzt Do’Urden, his wife Cattie-brie, and their daughter, Briennelle; Alustriel Silverhand and the rest of the Seven Sisters; Karlach Cliffgate, Astarion, and Shadowheart; and many more. Now, the world has new heroes: the ones you and your fellow players create.</p>
        <p>Heroes in the Forgotten Realms are larger than life. Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn gives you everything you need to create adventurers that fit right into the Realms, including new and revised subclasses and dozens of new feats and spells.</p>
         <p>Like the heroes who populate Faerûn, magic in the Realms is epic. This book introduces the Faerûnian technique of circle magic: a way for spellcasters to work together to make their spells more flexible and powerful.</p>
         <p>Heroes seldom work alone. This book details eight famous factions, each of which has a reach that extends across all Faerûn. Some of these factions, like the Harpers or the Lords’ Alliance , are honorable and just, helping the needy and protecting the innocent. Others, like the greedy Zhentarim or the power-hungry Red Wizards , oppress their victims and focus on amassing power. Your character can join any of these factions, earning rewards for loyal service. Or, your character might oppose a faction and brave its ire.</p>
         <p>Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, a world of epic characters and adventures!</p>

       <p>The Dalelands are broad forest vales with rolling farmlands, linked by narrow trade roads running through beautiful woods.

    <p>SECOND TO LAST PARAGRAPH. The oldest dales were founded over a thousand years ago by refugees from war-torn regions to the east and south. They found the immense, primeval forest of Cormanthor, home to an ancient elf civilization. Eltargrim, leader of the elves at the time, created the Dales Compact: an agreement that stated in return for promising not to cut deeper into the forest, the Dalefolk were allowed to settle around the forest’s edges or in places where the great trees didn’t grow. Spellcasters from both sides worked together to raise the Standing Stone in the center of Cormanthor as a symbol of unity. Elves opened the city of Myth Drannor to the Dalefolk, and a golden age flourished for centuries.</p>

</aside>
<p>In Barovia, the night is a curse. As darkness falls, wicked souls slip from the spires of Castle Ravenloft to work the will of an immortal overlord. This is the realm of the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, whose depravities have doomed him and his land to endless cycles of obsession and despair.</p>
<p>The howls of wolves and shrieks of ravens echo through the dismal valleys and oppressive forests of Barovia. In isolated communities, superstitious villagers find the brightness in their lives smothered by dread of their aloof overlord and other festering evils. These Barovians fear the night, as agents of the devil Strahd watch in the dark and claim whatever he desires. Yet few in Barovia realize their torments have played out again and again. In every generation, echoes of Strahd’s past reemerge, compelling and confounding the Darklord as he endlessly obsesses over the one victim who’s eluded him for centuries.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr">Domain Features</h3>
<p>Barovia is known for the following features:</p>
<p><strong>The Devil Strahd.</strong> Few have seen Count von Zarovich, but all know he dwells in Castle Ravenloft, a citadel from which few visitors return. Strahd is infamous for viciously executing any who flagrantly break his laws, but otherwise he rarely interferes in the lives of his people. Some whisper that he is a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>Haunted Tales.</strong> The stories of Barovia’s people are full of hidden evils: accursed ruins, portentous ravens, secretive cults, treacherous witches, vicious werewolves, and worse.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation and Suspicion.</strong> Barovia is a realm of wolf-prowled forests and treacherous mountains where the sun is obscured. The land’s superstitious people live in scattered villages. They distrust strangers, fearing they’re agents of the count.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr">Locations in Barovia</h3>
<p>Barovia is a land of long shadows where ancient wildernesses strangle the ruins of a near-forgotten empire. Mysteries pervade the domain, and those who leave the relative safety of Barovia’s dismal settlements enter perilous lands where mortals aren’t welcome.</p>
<p>The village of Barovia is described below, and other notable locations are summarized on the Barovia Locations table.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Village of Barovia</h4>
<p>Lying in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, the village of Barovia teeters on the brink of ruin. Its few residents rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbors of wickedness and fearing evils in the night. Their dread is largely justified, as wolves, ghosts, and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by callousness or wicked temptations.</p>
<p>A rare exception to the village’s cold desperation can be found at the local tavern, the Blood of the Vine. Those few who oppose Strahd’s evil congregate here—under the covert oversight of the count’s agents.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Castle Ravenloft</h4>
<p>Castle Ravenloft is Strahd von Zarovich’s accursed sanctuary. Tormented spirits and Strahd’s minions haunt the vast castle, each serving the count’s schemes, reflecting some aspect of his depraved past, or protecting his coffin in the castle catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie throughout the count’s home, some of which might hold the key to his undoing. The adventure <em>Curse of Strahd</em> details Castle Ravenloft.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Von Zarovich Sanctuaries</h4>
<p>Hidden across Barovia lie secret sanctuaries known only to Strahd and his servants. These crypt-like boltholes are hidden from the sun and exist primarily to shelter the count should he require. Over the centuries, Strahd has granted trusted servants access to some of these sanctuaries and used others in plots or experiments that he keeps distant from Castle Ravenloft. Still others Strahd has forgotten, allowing other evils to fester there. An example of one of these sites is depicted on map 2.2 and has the following features:</p>
<p><strong>Count’s Coffin.</strong> Hidden in each sanctuary lies a coffin bearing the von Zarovich crest. This might be obvious or in a space only accessible to vampires.</p>
<p><strong>The Lord’s Presence.</strong> Behind a vault-like iron door, an entry chamber holds a high-backed throne. Strahd forbids servants from using these symbols of his authority.</p>
<p><strong>Servants’ Space.</strong> Alcoves carved in the walls provide space for the coffins or bunks of Strahd’s living or dead servants. Sometimes, the Darklord uses these spaces for arcane experiments or as makeshift prisons.</p>

<!--BAROVIA ADVENTURES PAGE-->
<h2 class="compendium-hr">Adventures in Barovia</h2>
<p>Adventures set in Barovia involve oppressive, gothic menace; suspicion; and the legendary threat of Strahd von Zarovich. Use this section to develop horror adventures in this domain.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr">Horror in Barovia</h3>
<p>Adventures in Barovia often include the following elements.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">The Ancient, The Land</h4>
<p>Strahd remains bound to Barovia and it to him in a way few rulers or Darklords understand. He knows when any creature enters or dies violently within Barovia, and he takes offense when someone slays his servants or the domain’s wolves. Strahd can manifest a variety of dramatic effects, such as casting his voice on the wind, making his visage appear in the clouds, or changing the weather. These effects don’t aid him in combat, but they contribute to making him feel like an oppressive and ever-present threat.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Incarnations of the Past</h4>
<p>The subject of Strahd’s obsession, Tatyana, perpetually reincarnates among the people of Barovia. No matter what form she takes, the Darklord unceasingly seeks her, determined to possess her and make her part of an idealized fantasy of his past. Tatyana’s incarnation might be anyone, including a player character. If her incarnation is an NPC, roll on the Tatyana’s Reincarnation and Connection to Strahd tables to inspire a new chapter in the count’s tale of obsession.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr">Roots of Evil</h4>
<p>As the first Domain of Dread, Barovia might serve an important role in the metaphysical underpinnings of the setting. Some Darklords might have emerged from the Mists first in Barovia, encountered Strahd, and found their ways to their own domains later. Others might have a particular interest in Barovia and in undoing Strahd’s connection to his land. Consider these possibilities when developing plots involving conflicts between Darklords or escaping the Mists, as outlined in chapter 3.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Signs of the Count</h4>
<p>Servants of Strahd are everywhere in Barovia. While in the domain, characters experience regular reminders that the Darklord watches them—and that they are unwelcome. Roll on the Strahd’s Presence table to inspire such encounters.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr">Barovia Campaign Arc</h3>
<p>Campaigns set in Barovia involve communities oppressed by fear of Strahd and his cycles of obsession. A campaign here might follow this outline:</p>
<p><strong>Levels 1–5.</strong> The characters emerge from the Mists and seek shelter from danger in the village of Barovia, Krezk, or Vallaki. There they learn the people fear Count von Zarovich, and the characters might meet a reincarnation of Tatyana. They help strike back against agents of the count, such as deadly <strong>Wolves</strong> or <strong>Zombies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Levels 6–8.</strong> The characters learn more of the count’s history and about magical relics that might help oppose him. They seek these in haunted corners of the domain, facing servants of Strahd and remnants of his past, including <strong>Ghosts</strong>, <strong>Werewolves</strong>, and deadly <strong>Druids</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Levels 9–10.</strong> Armed with knowledge and magical weapons, the characters lay siege to Castle Ravenloft, facing Strahd’s most terrifying servants and the count himself.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr">Blood o’ the Vine</h3>
<p>Adventure for Level 6 Characters</p>
<p><strong>Situation.</strong> A discovery beneath the Blood of the Vine tavern in the village of Barovia has unleashed sinister magic, transforming the owners.</p>
<p><strong>Hook.</strong> Disguised as a human, Urwin Martikov (Medium <strong>Wereraven</strong>; see chapter 5) of the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki hires the characters to investigate why the Blood of the Vine tavern in the village of Barovia has closed, claiming he was in negotiations with the owners to buy it. Urwin offers to pay each character 500 GP.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Encounters</h4>
<p>This adventure uses map 2.2: Blood of the Vine Tavern and consists of these encounters.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corrupted Owners.</em></strong> The three human sisters who owned the Blood of the Vine tavern—Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvina—have been transformed into the following ravenous embodiments of primal hunger:</p>
<p><strong>Alenka</strong> (<strong>Relentless Slasher</strong>; see chapter 5) wields kitchenware and prowls the first floor.</p>
<p><strong>Mirabel</strong> (Medium <strong>Ghast Gravecaller)</strong> stalks the second floor with her two <strong>Ghoul</strong> servants. </p>
<p><strong>Sorvina</strong> (<strong>Unspeakable Horror</strong>; see chapter 5) conducts strange rituals in the basement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Taproom.</em></strong> Dust covers the taproom. Here, the animate corpse of Arik the barkeep mindlessly cleans pieces of shattered glassware at the bar. If attacked or otherwise interrupted, Arik falls to pieces.</p>
<p><strong><em>Office.</em></strong> The office in the northeast corner of the first floor is cluttered with junk and unfinished notes to the count describing the activities of the tavern’s patrons. This suggests the owners spied on the locals. If the characters have visited the tavern before, their activities are detailed. A trapdoor descends to an area beneath the tavern.</p>
<p><strong><em>Private Dining Room.</em></strong> The dining room in the southeast corner of the second floor is strewn with broken dishes, rotten food, and pages from a destroyed book. The pages are from the journal of Mirabel, one of the inn’s owners. Surviving entries note the following information:</p>
<p><strong>First Entry.</strong> Mirabel’s sister Sorvina discovered a hollow hidden under the tavern. Strange ruins lie amid the dirt walls. Sorvina wants to excavate them, hoping to find a tomb filed with treasures. </p>
<p><strong>Second Entry.</strong> Sorvina’s digging revealed strange standing stones. Mirabel worries about her sister, who’s started whispering to herself as she obsesses over learning more about the stones.</p>
<p><strong>Third Entry.</strong> Sorvina discovered the bones of some monster at the center of the standing stones. All three sisters are having nightmares from which they wake up ravenous. Sorvina claims the hunger is a blessing. Food has lost its taste, but the inn’s patrons suddenly smell delicious.</p>
<p><strong><em>Temple of Ravenkind.</em></strong> A circle of ancient menhirs carved with stylized ravens and sunbursts is partially unearthed beneath the tavern. The creature that was once Sorvina is here, chanting over a monstrous skeleton of black bones with stag horns and tusks. When she notices intruders, Sorvina howls, causing the bones to rise as a <strong>Minotaur Skeleton</strong>. Both it and Sorvina fight the characters to the death. When the skeleton is defeated, its bones remain intact.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cursed Remains.</em></strong> The skeleton exudes evil magic. Casting <em>Remove Curse</em> on the monster destroys the skeleton. However, if a character touches the skeleton (while it’s animate or otherwise), its spirit whispers to the character, bidding them to end its ancient curse. Doing so destroys the skeleton and grants the character the Second Skin Dark Gift (see chapter 1). A character who already has a Dark Gift can’t accept the curse.</p>
<p><strong><em>Returning to Urwin.</em></strong> If the characters defeat the monsters in the tavern and return to Urwin, he pays them and shares that a benevolent relic, the <em>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</em>, was created at a site like the one hidden under the tavern. The circle was used later to imprison a vicious spirit of the Svalich Woods. If the characters destroyed the skeleton, Urwin rewards them with two random <em>Quaal’s Feather Tokens</em>. Each character also receives a bonus 1,400 XP.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr">Treacherous Blood</h3>
<p>Adventure for Level 9 Characters</p>
<p><strong>Situation.</strong> Lyssa von Zarovich (Medium, Chaotic Evil <strong>Vampire Nightbringer</strong>), a distant relative of Strahd, plots to undermine the count by unleashing her monstrous servants on Barovia.</p>
<p><strong>Hook.</strong> A human resident of Vallaki named Ernst Larnak (Medium, Lawful Evil <strong>Spy</strong>) tells the characters that locals have seen figures excavating the churchyard in the ruins of Berez. He offers to pay 2,500 GP if they investigate. He doesn’t share that his information comes from the count’s servants.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr">Encounters</h4>
<p>This adventure uses map 2.2: Von Zarovich Sanctuary and consists of these encounters.</p>
<p><strong><em>Berez Churchyard.</em></strong> A stone slab covering a grave in the churchyard has been shattered, revealing stairs leading down to a von Zarovich sanctuary. There, two <strong>Vampire Spawn</strong> guardians fight trespassers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lyssa’s Plot.</em></strong> Lyssa greets the characters in the sanctuary’s central room. Observing that they don’t look like servants of the count, she shares the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is a distant relative of Count Strahd von Zarovich. She, too, is a vampire.</li>
<li>She seeks to depose Strahd and raise Barovia to its deserved glory.</li>
<li>With the aid of allies beyond the Mists, she has created servants immune to many of Strahd’s powers. Now she needs to test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether the characters agree to aid Lyssa, she opens a door to the adjacent chamber and unleashes a pair of <strong>Vampire Mind Flayers</strong> (see chapter 5). The monsters obey Lyssa’s commands and fight the characters. Lyssa fights as well but flees if she takes damage, swearing her revenge.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crypt.</em></strong> The chamber to the north holds the bloodless corpse of a mind flayer and a journal filled with accounts of strange dreams. The journal is a Mist talisman linked to the domain of Bluetspur (see “Other Domains of Dread” later in this chapter).</p>
<p><strong><em>Hidden Chamber.</em></strong> A character who investigates the large room as a Study action and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds evidence of a bricked-over hidden chamber in the east wall. Characters can physically remove the wall in 1 hour (half that time if they have Mason’s Tools).</p>
<p><strong><em>Elder Evil.</em></strong> Strahd buried a foe in a coffin behind the main chamber’s east wall. Opening the coffin releases a <strong>Vampire Nosferatu</strong> and a <strong>Swarm of Infesting Insects</strong> (both detailed in chapter 5) that fight to the death. Also in the coffin is a <em>Gem of B</em><em>rightness</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If the characters defeat or drive off Lyssa, each character gains a bonus 2,600 XP.</p>
