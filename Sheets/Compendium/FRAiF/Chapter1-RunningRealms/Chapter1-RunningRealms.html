  Faerûn is enormous, and the Forgotten Realms embrace a wide array of fantasy adventures. In the
  bustling metropolis of Calimport, characters might bargain for a wish with a powerful genie, but
  in the far north of Icewind Dale, adventurers from isolated fishing villages struggle to survive
  the bitter cold. Mariners on the Trackless Sea hunt whales and explore the floating islands of the
  archfey, while in the Sunrise Mountains far to the east, spellcasters from Thay and Rashemen
  rediscover ancient magical secrets.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2cb4d8b-ffe5-447c-8523-9da5ea4efd35">

  Character Creation
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="787a49cc-dd5c-4589-a76b-77777d67f733">
  Characters in the Forgotten Realms are larger than life. A character is never just a simple
  adventurer; they might be the heir to a kingdom, have an Artifact for a heart, or secretly be a
  vampire. They might be Chosen by a deity, be tutored by the greatest wizard that ever lived, or be
  descended from an archfey or demigod. They might be the sole survivor of a long-lost culture, an
  artificial person created by an alliance of powerful wizards, or a revolutionary eager to bring
  down the corrupt and cruel society from which they’ve narrowly escaped.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e5eb186-be40-4704-9631-49f6a05fa4ac">
  Such characters might not fit in other settings. A royal heir trapped in Ravenloft is just another
  prisoner, and in the world of Eberron, deities don’t interfere in mortal affairs. But in the
  Forgotten Realms, characters with illustrious histories or campaign-changing secrets are common.
  Keep an open mind when players suggest such characters for your campaign, and try to accommodate
  them. For players that create more down-to-earth or grounded characters, brainstorm ways to make
  their characters stand out from other adventurers. Few players will argue when you give their
  character an epic destiny.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a789bdd0-47c1-4b32-b7dc-263c89f97942">
  Epic characters are often more powerful than other adventurers. They might carry unique magic
  items or an Artifact, wield mundane authority, or even command an army! It’s important to spread
  these benefits around so that every player shares in the epic adventure. Consider each character’s
  unique niche, and protect that niche as the campaign proceeds. For example, if one player wants
  their character to be heir to the throne of Sembia, the other characters shouldn’t also be
  potential rulers of realms of their own. Instead, encourage them to pursue interests that don’t
  overlap with those of other players.

  Low-Level Challenges
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6383a58c-5cc8-4699-86c8-3c2696a65c56">
  Epic adventure implies adventuring at high level. But most campaigns start at low level, typically
  level 1 or level 3. How can you make a campaign feel epic from the start?
</p>
<h4

    >Player’s Handbook</a
  >
  includes guidelines for creating characters of any level. A campaign of this sort can be a
  challenge for new players, however. Dungeons & Dragons teaches the game to players as they slowly
  but steadily accumulate new class features. If your group includes players new to the game, you
  might want to accommodate them by making low-level characters in the usual way, then use the other
  suggestions below.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e72b46b8-e9ad-427d-aa3f-c2f8681ea1f9">
  If your players are experienced, or your group is supportive and good at guiding new players
  through the rules, consider creating characters at higher level. Level 5, when characters get
  additional attacks and spellcasters gain access to level 3 spells like [spells]Fireball[/spells],
  is a good place to begin your epic journey.

  Use Flashback Adventures
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d31fe23d-0112-470c-8e84-e19673d39b27">
  But even epic heroes have to start somewhere, and early levels move quickly. Characters typically
  advance to level 2 after only a single session of play and to level 3 after another one or two
  sessions. You might frame these levels as a single extended flashback—an adventure that drew the
  characters together many years before your campaign properly begins. In this flashback adventure,
  the characters haven’t yet grown into the powers they’ll eventually command, but you can
  foreshadow events and antagonists that will appear later once the characters come together at
  higher level for a new adventure.

  Connect to the Greater Story
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="75cc8405-6109-4f2f-b932-6b7f33d6fd26">
  To help make a low-level adventure feel epic, give it a clear connection to the campaign’s greater
  story. For example, if your campaign focuses on the corruption of moonwells in the Moonshae Isles
  by the curse known as the Rusting (see
  <a
    hrref="/sources/dnd/fraif/moonshae-isles/"
    data-content-chunk-id="cf11589d-011a-4089-b86e-c7ef10732e87"
    >chapter 5</a
  >), make a moonwell prominent in the first adventure. Perhaps the characters meet an elderly druid
  who becomes their mentor (and who you intend the campaign villain to murder by the time the
  characters reach level 5). By doing this, even humble adventures feel connected to a greater
  whole.

  Preview the Villain
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4552c967-7953-40a5-8919-fec01e15eb65">
  Epic campaigns require epic adversaries, but high CR monsters will demoralize your players if
  encountered when the characters are low level. Give your powerful adversary weaker lieutenants and
  minions appropriate to the party’s level. For example,
  <a
    href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Venger"
    data-content-chunk-id="8120e731-8b65-495f-bf55-b7f625baa3bc"
    >Venger</a
  >
  is an epic foe, but he relies on a [monsters]Shadow Demon[/monsters] (CR 4) to be his eyes and
  ears, and he makes extensive use of bullywugs and various humanoid minions. Your campaign
  antagonist can and should appear early in your campaign so the players build a relationship with
  them, but this meeting should occur in a situation where violence is impossible: Venger might
  appear to the characters as an illusion, or speak with the characters at a diplomatic event where
  everyone has sworn oaths of nonviolence and given up their weapons and magic items.

  High Stakes
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="995c71dc-dae1-4df4-aa36-94b6528bf208">
  Epic stories are distinguished by epic stakes. In Faerûn, an evil necromancer doesn’t just raise a
  few corpses—they turn the entire population of Neverwinter into fast and hungry zombies. A
  Forgotten Realms villain doesn’t just invent a new spell—they break the Weave and unleash the
  Spellplague. When an epic villain goes down, they don’t just die—they crash a flying city into
  Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0178196f-1dcd-4645-a5b4-8c9bc22257e2">
  Fantasy roleplaying games boast many iconic epic plots. Perhaps your campaign antagonist wants to
  ascend to godhood; forge or obtain an Artifact; unleash a long-imprisoned Elder Evil; cause or
  sustain a realm-wide curse; or invade with an army of undead, fiends, or other monsters. The
  player characters must destroy the Artifact, break the curse, or otherwise prevent the villain
  from enacting their agenda.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61fe16bc-77c0-4d1a-805c-7b9fdfa2684c">
  Stakes can be high even when characters are of relatively low level. The heroes of many of these
  stories aren’t especially powerful or experienced. Indeed, the power imbalance between the
  terrifying villain and the plucky, upstart heroes is part of what makes the adventure so
  memorable. Remember, characters in Dungeons & Dragons are exceptional. Most villages might have a
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters], but they don’t have a Cleric. The town might boast a sage who can
  answer questions or brew alchemical elixirs, but Wizards are rare. And the city guard might be led
  by a [monsters]Warrior Veteran[/monsters], but most of the watch are humble
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters], not Fighters. The characters in your game are more capable than
  almost everyone else in the Forgotten Realms.

  Character Death

  Epic threats and stakes can result in epic deaths. The

  challenges.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90a3ff12-61a3-47ac-8247-9607d3fcc1eb">
  Resist the temptation to make every encounter high difficulty. Epic adventures have high stakes,
  but it’s important to vary the difficulty of encounters just as you would in any other adventure,
  lest the campaign become an unrelenting endurance test. Even in low-difficulty and
  medium-difficulty encounters, a character can die from a series of bad rolls. But epic heroes
  deserve meaningful deaths, so consider another fate if a character would die in a minor encounter.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f3c49be-73c0-4ded-a12e-b3826eaa99b6">
  This doesn’t mean the threat of death shouldn’t be present, only that death in epic stories is
  rare. It’s not unexpected for characters to die in the final battle, especially if that battle is
  a series of encounters strung out over a single day, like a siege or an infiltration of the
  villain’s lair. But epic stories often also include a character that dies halfway through the
  story in a heroic last stand that both saddens and inspires the other characters for the rest of
  the campaign. (Some players will even agree for their characters to serve this role ahead of
  time!)

  Epic Destinies
</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e12dc1e-453b-4736-a0fa-3883901f9c7e">
  Players can support and strengthen the epic feel of Forgotten Realms adventures by creating
  characters that are larger than life. As the DM, you can help give those characters a career
  that’s truly momentous by working with each player to sketch out a story arc that plays out as the
  character advances in level. Perhaps the character is fated to wield an Artifact (such as the
  [magicitems]Calimemnon Crystal[/magicitems], detailed in
  <a
    href="/sources/dnd/fraif/magic-items#Chapter8MagicItems"

    >chapter 8</a
  >) or become the Chosen of a deity. The character might have been subjected to horrific
  experimentation by mind flayers, giving them psionic powers at great cost. They might be descended
  from an evil god (such as Bane), inheriting terrible power that they must learn to use without
  succumbing to cruelty. These character-specific stories, called epic destinies, play out over the
  course of the campaign as the character goes on adventures.

  How Epic Destinies Work
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8247a811-dbba-4023-b9c6-642332cd5fdc">
  To create an epic destiny, work with a character’s player to create milestones along the
  character’s journey, setting these milestones to specific character levels. As a character
  advances to each milestone, their destiny manifests and the character’s life changes in a dramatic
  way, represented by feats, supernatural gifts (detailed in
  <a

  play, detailed in

    >Player’s Handbook</a

  provided below.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08d64c1d-0dd1-4e3d-a545-33bced4fac73">
  An epic destiny is something the DM and player decide together. The character might reject their
  destiny, but the player knows what’s coming and is on board. In fact, you and the player might
  plan that the character will try to reject their destiny! Nevertheless, an epic destiny is never
  set in stone, and if a player wants to change their character’s destiny during the campaign, work
  with them to decide what that new destiny might be.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c1a1b9e-8d6c-4153-835b-535a28b381f9">
  The benefits associated with a character’s epic destiny usually fall within the normal rules for
  character advancement and guidelines for character rewards. In other words, a character with an
  epic destiny doesn’t have more feats than a character without one, and any magic items or
  supernatural gifts the character acquires should fall generally within the guidelines in the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for characters acquiring such rewards. However, you might decide
  otherwise. A character with an epic destiny might be more powerful than a traditional character,
  gaining an additional feat or acquiring a powerful magic item at a lower level than the guidelines
  suggest. Don’t break the rules for just one character, though; every character in the party should
  receive such benefits at about the same time so no one feels left behind or pushed to the
  sideline. That said, making epic characters a bit more powerful can make your job as DM easier,
  since you can pit the party against significant challenges with less risk of character death.

  At the beginning of the character’s story, the character is related to the ruler, but no one
  expects the character to actually inherit. Older siblings are being trained for that role, giving

  By level 4, however, something has changed and the character is now expected to inherit the

  must forge their own path and confront their former teacher’s rivals and enemies. But they gain
  the archmage’s spellbook, which contains many spells (including some beyond the character’s
  current ability to cast).

  But when the character reaches higher level, the archmage returns from death or is rescued.
  Perhaps they were never missing at all, and their absence was part of an elaborate test for their
  former student. Regardless, the character’s adventures on other planes as part of locating their
  former master results in the player selecting, at level 12, a feat such as

  The first appearance of the Forgotten Realms in Dungeons & Dragons was in 1982, and in the decades
  since, thousands of writers, artists, editors, DMs, and players have added to Faerûn’s history and
  cast of characters—a body of knowledge sometimes referred to as “Realms lore.” This book and its
  companion

  Your Forgotten Realms
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbc0353b-75f5-4ffc-85ba-65aa5bc548ae">
  The most important thing to know about Realms lore is that you don’t have to know it.
  Improvisation is the most powerful tool in the DM’s toolbox. When your players visit Waterdeep,
  you don’t need the information in <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em>. You can do what every DM does:
  make it up! Make Faerûn your own.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="31079a46-8241-4f08-9e3e-62b63753ea01">
  This principle extends to more than just improvising during a session. You can ignore or rewrite
  any of Faerûn’s history to suit your game. Perhaps you want the Red Wizards to be evil
  necromancers, and you want Thay to be a horrifying realm bent on conquest and populated solely by
  undead. That’s not how Thay is described in <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</em>, but that
  doesn’t stop you from making the game you want to play.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dea7ba23-2743-43ba-ad14-8d98ecb8e726">
  For a more nuanced approach, you can simply deemphasize elements of the setting that don’t fit
  your campaign. With this approach, you highlight the aspects of the setting that are important to
  your story, and you let the rest of Faerûn’s history pass by without comment. As an example, you
  might feel the Spellplague and Second Sundering—cataclysmic events that reshaped Faerûn—don’t suit
  your campaign. You can decide Faerûn has long since recovered from these events, so they don’t
  need to affect your campaign. You’re not rewriting the history of Faerûn—you’re picking and
  choosing the elements that make you excited to be a DM in the Forgotten Realms.

  Experts at the Table
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c277d70-8cf4-485a-8502-2d9cc1313c8c">
  Because the Forgotten Realms has such a long history and so many dedicated fans, it’s possible
  someone at your game table knows more about Faerûn than you do. This can be challenging, but you
  can overcome those challenges with communication and preparation.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ba60ae1-4307-4479-a6e9-e06bf0c17c33">
  Talk with Realms lore experts at your table, and share your approach. If you intend to improvise
  your Forgotten Realms or otherwise deviate from existing lore, make that clear to your players so
  they know what to expect.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="652af9d0-ccee-4eaa-b454-e8c59ddeab51">
  You can take advantage of player expertise by turning such players into a resource at the table.
  To return to an earlier example, if the characters arrive in Waterdeep and you don’t have an inn
  prepared, you can ask one of the experts at your table, “What inn do you stay at, and what’s
  unique about it?”
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d99a6286-4d1f-4a42-a5fd-88eb566ffa04">
  You can also use your own knowledge of Realms lore to plant clues in the campaign that experts
  will recognize. When you use characters, locations, magic items, and adversaries from Forgotten
  Realms history, the Realms lore experts at your table will enjoy recognizing the Easter eggs
  you’ve placed. The adventure in
  <a
    href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-lost-library-of-lethchauntos/"
    data-content-chunk-id="e081c340-68ae-4cd6-8c7c-8018bbefda13"
    >chapter 7</a
  >
  of this book, “The Lost Library of Lethchauntos,” is a good example of this strategy. Lethchauntos
  is a very minor character in the history of the Forgotten Realms, but that just makes it all the
  more memorable when a player recognizes his name. At the same time, don’t be afraid to play with
  expectations and keep the players guessing.

  Cast of Thousands
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e91330d-8b7d-493f-b920-8608b2b33e20">
  Faerûn has a reputation for being home to many powerful wizards and other characters. This can be
  an obstacle at the table if your players encounter a problem and expect an NPC like Laeral
  Silverhand, the Blackstaff, or Drizzt to swoop in and take care of things. Your characters might
  even try to locate and recruit such characters, hoping to use them to solve the party’s problems.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="580f073f-ea1b-4cc3-ba1b-5f5c7c250ff7">
  But it’s important to keep the adventurers at the center of the story. The weight of Faerûn rests
  on their shoulders alone. No one else can solve their problems for them. If your players begin to
  ask, “Where’s the Chosen of Mystra, and why isn’t she helping?” here are some possible answers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2bcb70b2-7d45-4c42-8cc1-ee5c5ea06fc9">
  Talk to your players about this issue. Stress that the campaign is about their characters, not
  illustrious NPCs. While characters in Waterdeep could call on the Blackstaff for aid, this
  sidelines the characters and makes them minor figures in their own story. Encourage players to
  tackle problems themselves and not give away the dramatic spotlight.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e973d541-a167-45ab-a03b-059b218cbfe0">
  Perhaps the characters have information no one else does, or perhaps they have a connection to the
  antagonist that makes the conflict personal. If the villain’s plan is on a tight schedule, the
  characters might not have time to recruit help. Powerful archmages and rulers might not have the
  patience to listen to outlandish claims from a party of unknown adventurers, let alone believe
  them.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fcf0764-975d-419f-b63e-ce467949d46b">
  Heroes in the Forgotten Realms often develop rivalries and grudges with villains who return again
  and again. Characters might discover when they try to recruit Laeral Silverhand to their cause
  that she’s busy dealing with Myrkul—again. And, because this sort of rivalry is well understood by
  famous NPCs in the setting, Laeral expects the characters to handle their villainous rival on
  their own, without interference from her or anyone else.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecda1a86-3047-4b52-acf0-4ca64072bcd7">
  Finally, remember that time marches on. Many of the famous heroes of Faerûn are dead, retired, or
  missing. New heroes are needed now more than ever.

  the character. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw can change the tragic
  outcome of their vision; a character who fails experiences the tragedy all over again.

  When every vision has resolved, the characters return to their senses, and the demonic figure of
  their visions manifests as a <strong>[monsters]Succubus[/monsters].</strong> The succubus is
  Vulnerable to all damage from characters who succeeded on the save and changed the outcome of
  their vision, but characters who failed that save and experienced a tragic outcome again have the
  [condition]Frightened[/condition] condition instead.

  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If the succubus is defeated, the Tenebrous Stone loses its
  power, and the quarry returns to normal over several days.

  <strong><em>Nethertide Leavings.</em></strong> Orc equipment and bones form a pile near a bronze
  floor plate that reads, in Common, “Along Selûne’s path they did walk, leaving no stone unturned.”
  This is a Harper clue, and a character who recognizes it knows it refers to “Moonlight Paean,” a
  famous ballad. A character who recites the ballad causes silver light to bathe the chamber,
  revealing a [magicitems]Shield of Missile Attraction[/magicitems] and a [magicitems]Sword of
  Vengeance[/magicitems] lying among the bones. Other treasures and art objects here amount to a CR
  4 random treasure hoard. Disturbing these items without first reciting the ballad causes bones to

  statue, is a Harper clue. Characters who recognize it know the tune depicted: “Coggin’s Reel.”
  Playing or humming this tune disarms the trap.

  <strong><em>Tomb.</em></strong> This stone coffin is locked with the [spells]Arcane Lock[/spells]
  spell. Its lid reads, in Elvish, “To shine a light on the future.” This is a Harper clue. A
  character who recognizes it knows the response: “Study the past.” This phrase is the password for
  the arcane lock. Within the coffin is [magicitems]Demon Armor[/magicitems] that animates and
  fights; use the stat block for a <strong>[monsters]Cambion[/monsters].</strong> If the proper
  phrase was spoken, the armor starts the combat [rules]Bloodied[/rules].

  Whisper in one month and will wait one month more for Candlekeep’s representatives to make the
  trade. After that, Sullivan will be killed. Janussi confides that Sullivan was carrying a scroll
  of priceless Netherese magic when he was abducted. She refuses to encourage the bandits by paying
  the ransom. She offers the party 1,500 GP plus expenses if they will travel to Kozah’s Whisper and

  looks—broke Taydan’s heart. Reyla (Medium [monsters]Aberrant Cultist[/monsters]), a tiefling who
  reveres Beshaba, led Taydan to blame Sune and steal a ruby rose from Sune’s Temple of Beauty in
  Waterdeep. Reyla and Taydan destroyed every street-corner mirror shrine to Sune they passed while
  fleeing the city and headed to the Passion Pools, a Sune pilgrimage site that houses reflecting
  pools sacred to the goddess. The pools are located in Westwood, 100 miles north of Waterdeep and
  30 miles northwest of Amphail.

  knight begins combat.

  <strong><em>4: Fountain of Dark Knowledge.</em></strong> A fountain of unholy water churns in the
  room’s center. Narbossa, a [monsters]Marid[/monsters] drained of color and vitality by the
  necromantic energy of the vault, is bound to the fountain. Narbossa longs to return to the
  Elemental Plane of Water. It is [rules]Indifferent[/rules] to the characters, and the spell
  binding the marid to the fountain can be ended with the [spells]Dispel Magic[/spells] spell (DC

  <strong><em>5: Library.</em></strong> The library holds dozens of rare and ancient books on

  Velsharoon is a [monsters]Stone Golem[/monsters] that fights if the books are touched.

  devotees of Tempus, have just discovered the secret entrance to the tomb. All these individuals
  are Chaotic Neutral and Medium. They include Ysold, a human ([monsters]Warrior

  elf knight (use the [monsters]Githyanki Knight[/monsters] stat block, but change the creature type

  <strong><em>Trooper Hall.</em></strong> The walls of the chamber surrounded by seven tombs depict
  assembled troops, each soldier with a unique face. The [spells]Glyph of Warding[/spells] spell has
  been cast on the south and west entrances to this chamber. A rune is triggered if a creature moves
  through that entrance. Both glyphs use the Explosive Rune option, one dealing Lightning damage and

  <strong><em>Clangor Halls.</em></strong> Wall carvings depict the fury of war in the two eastern
  chambers and stairs down to level 2. When trespassers enter, a war horn sounds, red light
  illuminates the area, sounds of warfare erupt, and thirteen guardian spirits manifest from burial
  niches. Four of these spirits have the stat block of a [monsters]Gladiator[/monsters], and nine
  have the stat block of a [monsters]Berserker[/monsters], but all are Celestials instead of
  Humanoids.

  When the spirits begin combat, each character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or enter
  a battle fury. Characters in a battle fury have Advantage on attack rolls using Strength, but
  attack rolls against them have Advantage, and the character can’t take the
  [action]Disengage[/action] or [action]Dodge[/action] actions. At the end of their turn, characters
  in a battle fury repeat the saving throw, ending the fury on a success. When the last spirit is
  defeated, any battle fury affecting a character ends.

  <strong><em>Pillared Hall.</em></strong> Double doors seal this hall on the east and west. Within,
  wall carvings portray warriors in celebration. A simple altar to Tempus occupies a long southern
  niche, while narrower alcoves hold old crates and barrels of military rations long turned to dust.
  A character who prays to Tempus at the altar can use it to cast [spells]Heroes’ Feast[/spells]
  without spell components. Once used in this way, the altar becomes nonmagical.

  <strong><em>Foehammer Hall.</em></strong> Stairs descend to a single hall with two supporting
  columns. Niches line the walls, which depict Tempus battling various foes. Shelves in the niches
  hold broken implements of war. When all the characters have entered, a horn sounds, the northern
  wall cracks, and an avatar of Tempus charges from it. Use the [monsters]Questing Knight[/monsters]
  stat block for the avatar, changing creature type to Celestial and any Radiant damage to Fire
  damage. When the avatar drops to 0 Hit Points, it rises again as a [monsters]Berserker
  Commander[/monsters] (change its creature type to Celestial) with all its Hit Points and continues
  to fight. If defeated again, it is destroyed.

  proficiency in the [skill]Arcana[/skill] or [skill]Religion[/skill] skill can detonate a warhead.
  Detonating one warhead causes a chain reaction with other warheads, obliterating the arm the
