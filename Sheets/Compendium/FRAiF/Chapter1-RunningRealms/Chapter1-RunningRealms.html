    factions, magic, and geographical regions.
  </p>
</ul>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="CreatingEpicFantasy">Creating Epic Fantasy</h2>
<p>
  Faerûn is enormous, and the Forgotten Realms embrace a wide array of fantasy adventures. In the
  bustling metropolis of Calimport, characters might bargain for a wish with a powerful genie, but
  in the far north of Icewind Dale, adventurers from isolated fishing villages struggle to survive
  the bitter cold. Mariners on the Trackless Sea hunt whales and explore the floating islands of the
  archfey, while in the Sunrise Mountains far to the east, spellcasters from Thay and Rashemen
  rediscover ancient magical secrets.
</p>
<p>The tone of such wildly various adventures can be described by one word: epic.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="CharacterCreation">Character Creation</h3>
<p>
  Characters in the Forgotten Realms are larger than life. A character is never just a simple
  adventurer; they might be the heir to a kingdom, have an Artifact for a heart, or secretly be a
  vampire. They might be Chosen by a deity, be tutored by the greatest wizard that ever lived, or be
  descended from an archfey or demigod. They might be the sole survivor of a long-lost culture, an
  artificial person created by an alliance of powerful wizards, or a revolutionary eager to bring
  down the corrupt and cruel society from which they’ve narrowly escaped.
</p>
<p>
  Such characters might not fit in other settings. A royal heir trapped in Ravenloft is just another
  prisoner, and in the world of Eberron, deities don’t interfere in mortal affairs. But in the
  Forgotten Realms, characters with illustrious histories or campaign-changing secrets are common.
  Keep an open mind when players suggest such characters for your campaign, and try to accommodate
  them. For players that create more down-to-earth or grounded characters, brainstorm ways to make
  their characters stand out from other adventurers. Few players will argue when you give their
  character an epic destiny.
</p>
<p>
  Epic characters are often more powerful than other adventurers. They might carry unique magic
  items or an Artifact, wield mundane authority, or even command an army! It’s important to spread
  these benefits around so that every player shares in the epic adventure. Consider each character’s
  unique niche, and protect that niche as the campaign proceeds. For example, if one player wants
  their character to be heir to the throne of Sembia, the other characters shouldn’t also be
  potential rulers of realms of their own. Instead, encourage them to pursue interests that don’t
  overlap with those of other players.
</p>
<p>
  The “<a href="#EpicDestinies">Epic Destinies</a>” section of this chapter offers suggestions for
  how to reflect a character’s gradual growth from an exceptional beginning to a grand conclusion
  for their story.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="LowLevelChallenges">Low-Level Challenges</h3>
<p>
  Epic adventure implies adventuring at high level. But most campaigns start at low level, typically
  level 1 or level 3. How can you make a campaign feel epic from the start?
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="StartataHigherLevel">Start at a Higher Level</h4>
<p>
  Your first option is to start at higher level. The
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a> includes guidelines for
  creating characters of any level. A campaign of this sort can be a challenge for new players,
  however. Dungeons & Dragons teaches the game to players as they slowly but steadily accumulate new
  class features. If your group includes players new to the game, you might want to accommodate them
  by making low-level characters in the usual way, then use the other suggestions below.
</p>
<p>
  If your players are experienced, or your group is supportive and good at guiding new players
  through the rules, consider creating characters at higher level. Level 5, when characters get
  additional attacks and spellcasters gain access to level 3 spells like [spells]Fireball[/spells],
  is a good place to begin your epic journey.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="UseFlashbackAdventures">Use Flashback Adventures</h4>
<p>
  But even epic heroes have to start somewhere, and early levels move quickly. Characters typically
  advance to level 2 after only a single session of play and to level 3 after another one or two
  sessions. You might frame these levels as a single extended flashback—an adventure that drew the
  characters together many years before your campaign properly begins. In this flashback adventure,
  the characters haven’t yet grown into the powers they’ll eventually command, but you can
  foreshadow events and antagonists that will appear later once the characters come together at
  higher level for a new adventure.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ConnecttotheGreaterStory">Connect to the Greater Story</h4>
<p>
  To help make a low-level adventure feel epic, give it a clear connection to the campaign’s greater
  story. For example, if your campaign focuses on the corruption of moonwells in the Moonshae Isles
  by the curse known as the Rusting (see
  <a hrref="/sources/dnd/fraif/moonshae-isles/">chapter 5</a>), make a moonwell prominent in the
  first adventure. Perhaps the characters meet an elderly druid who becomes their mentor (and who
  you intend the campaign villain to murder by the time the characters reach level 5). By doing
  this, even humble adventures feel connected to a greater whole.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="PreviewtheVillain">Preview the Villain</h4>
<p>
  Epic campaigns require epic adversaries, but high CR monsters will demoralize your players if
  encountered when the characters are low level. Give your powerful adversary weaker lieutenants and
  minions appropriate to the party’s level. For example,
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Venger">Venger</a> is an epic foe, but he relies on a
  [monsters]Shadow Demon[/monsters] (CR 4) to be his eyes and ears, and he makes extensive use of
  bullywugs and various humanoid minions. Your campaign antagonist can and should appear early in
  your campaign so the players build a relationship with them, but this meeting should occur in a
  situation where violence is impossible: Venger might appear to the characters as an illusion, or
  speak with the characters at a diplomatic event where everyone has sworn oaths of nonviolence and
  given up their weapons and magic items.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="HighStakes">High Stakes</h3>
<p>
  Epic stories are distinguished by epic stakes. In Faerûn, an evil necromancer doesn’t just raise a
  few corpses—they turn the entire population of Neverwinter into fast and hungry zombies. A
  Forgotten Realms villain doesn’t just invent a new spell—they break the Weave and unleash the
  Spellplague. When an epic villain goes down, they don’t just die—they crash a flying city into
  Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p>
  Fantasy roleplaying games boast many iconic epic plots. Perhaps your campaign antagonist wants to
  ascend to godhood; forge or obtain an Artifact; unleash a long-imprisoned Elder Evil; cause or
  sustain a realm-wide curse; or invade with an army of undead, fiends, or other monsters. The
  player characters must destroy the Artifact, break the curse, or otherwise prevent the villain
  from enacting their agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Stakes can be high even when characters are of relatively low level. The heroes of many of these
  stories aren’t especially powerful or experienced. Indeed, the power imbalance between the
  terrifying villain and the plucky, upstart heroes is part of what makes the adventure so
  memorable. Remember, characters in Dungeons & Dragons are exceptional. Most villages might have a
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters], but they don’t have a Cleric. The town might boast a sage who can
  answer questions or brew alchemical elixirs, but Wizards are rare. And the city guard might be led
  by a [monsters]Warrior Veteran[/monsters], but most of the watch are humble
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters], not Fighters. The characters in your game are more capable than
  almost everyone else in the Forgotten Realms.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="CharacterDeath">Character Death</h3>
<p>
  Epic threats and stakes can result in epic deaths. The
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> has advice on how to handle
  character death in your game, but epic adventures pose unique challenges.
</p>
<p>
  Resist the temptation to make every encounter high difficulty. Epic adventures have high stakes,
  but it’s important to vary the difficulty of encounters just as you would in any other adventure,
  lest the campaign become an unrelenting endurance test. Even in low-difficulty and
  medium-difficulty encounters, a character can die from a series of bad rolls. But epic heroes
  deserve meaningful deaths, so consider another fate if a character would die in a minor encounter.
</p>
<p>
  This doesn’t mean the threat of death shouldn’t be present, only that death in epic stories is
  rare. It’s not unexpected for characters to die in the final battle, especially if that battle is
  a series of encounters strung out over a single day, like a siege or an infiltration of the
  villain’s lair. But epic stories often also include a character that dies halfway through the
  story in a heroic last stand that both saddens and inspires the other characters for the rest of
  the campaign. (Some players will even agree for their characters to serve this role ahead of
  time!)
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="EpicDestinies">Epic Destinies</h2>
<p>
  Players can support and strengthen the epic feel of Forgotten Realms adventures by creating
  characters that are larger than life. As the DM, you can help give those characters a career
  that’s truly momentous by working with each player to sketch out a story arc that plays out as the
  character advances in level. Perhaps the character is fated to wield an Artifact (such as the
  [magicitems]Calimemnon Crystal[/magicitems], detailed in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/magic-items#Chapter8MagicItems">chapter 8</a>) or become the Chosen of
  a deity. The character might have been subjected to horrific experimentation by mind flayers,
  giving them psionic powers at great cost. They might be descended from an evil god (such as Bane),
  inheriting terrible power that they must learn to use without succumbing to cruelty. These
  character-specific stories, called epic destinies, play out over the course of the campaign as the
  character goes on adventures.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="HowEpicDestiniesWork">How Epic Destinies Work</h3>
<p>
  To create an epic destiny, work with a character’s player to create milestones along the
  character’s journey, setting these milestones to specific character levels. As a character
  advances to each milestone, their destiny manifests and the character’s life changes in a dramatic
  way, represented by feats, supernatural gifts (detailed in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>), magic items, or other
  benefits and rewards the character acquires. You can use the tiers of play, detailed in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creating-a-character">chapter 2</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a>, as a guide to when these
  milestones might occur. Two detailed examples of epic destinies are provided below.
</p>
<p>
  An epic destiny is something the DM and player decide together. The character might reject their
  destiny, but the player knows what’s coming and is on board. In fact, you and the player might
  plan that the character will try to reject their destiny! Nevertheless, an epic destiny is never
  set in stone, and if a player wants to change their character’s destiny during the campaign, work
  with them to decide what that new destiny might be.
</p>
<p>
  The benefits associated with a character’s epic destiny usually fall within the normal rules for
  character advancement and guidelines for character rewards. In other words, a character with an
  epic destiny doesn’t have more feats than a character without one, and any magic items or
  supernatural gifts the character acquires should fall generally within the guidelines in the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for characters acquiring such rewards. However, you might decide
  otherwise. A character with an epic destiny might be more powerful than a traditional character,
  gaining an additional feat or acquiring a powerful magic item at a lower level than the guidelines
  suggest. Don’t break the rules for just one character, though; every character in the party should
  receive such benefits at about the same time so no one feels left behind or pushed to the
  sideline. That said, making epic characters a bit more powerful can make your job as DM easier,
  since you can pit the party against significant challenges with less risk of character death.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ExampleEpicDestinies">Example Epic Destinies</h3>
<p>
  The following sections detail two example destinies: one for an heir to a throne, and another for
  an aspiring wizard.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HeirtotheThrone">Heir to the Throne</h4>
<p>
  As an example of an epic destiny, consider a character who is the heir to the throne, destined to
  rule a realm … if they survive long enough!
</p>
<p>
  At the beginning of the character’s story, the character is related to the ruler, but no one
  expects the character to actually inherit. Older siblings are being trained for that role, giving
  the character opportunity to gallivant around Faerûn on adventure. To reflect the character’s
  past, the player selects the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-origins#Noble">Noble</a> background for their character
  during character creation.
</p>
<p>
  By level 4, however, something has changed and the character is now expected to inherit the
  throne. Perhaps their older siblings have been exiled, or perhaps the character’s adventures have
  proven them a more suitable candidate for the throne. The character is subjected to an intense
  training regimen to make them better qualified for rulership, and the player selects the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#SkillExpert">Skill Expert</a> feat for their character.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually the ruler dies or steps down, and when the character reaches level 11, the character
  ascends to the throne. When they do, they gain a Legendary magic item that is the symbol of royal
  power and authority.
</p>
<p>
  But no ruler rules forever. When the character reaches level 17, the character experiences a
  vision of the future that convinces them someone else must rule the realm. For the good of the
  land, the character must step down. To represent their visions of the future, the character gains
  a Charm that allows them to cast the [spells]Foresight[/spells] spell once, targeting themself
  only.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="PupiloftheArchmage">Pupil of the Archmage</h4>
<p>
  This example epic destiny is aimed at Wizards tutored by or related to one of Faerûn’s great
  archmages.
</p>
<p>
  When the character begins adventuring, they’re the archmage’s apprentice. To reflect the
  specialized education and training the character has had, they choose the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/character-origins#Sage">Sage</a> background.
</p>
<p>
  When the character reaches level 5, the archmage disappears or is presumed dead. The character
  must forge their own path and confront their former teacher’s rivals and enemies. But they gain
  the archmage’s spellbook, which contains many spells (including some beyond the character’s
  current ability to cast).
</p>
<p>
  But when the character reaches higher level, the archmage returns from death or is rescued.
  Perhaps they were never missing at all, and their absence was part of an elaborate test for their
  former student. Regardless, the character’s adventures on other planes as part of locating their
  former master results in the player selecting, at level 12, a feat such as
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#FeyTouched">Fey Touched</a> or
  <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/feats#ShadowTouched">Shadow Touched</a> for their character.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, when the character reaches level 17, the archmage dies and the character inherits the
  archmage’s mystic tower, adding the
  <a hrref="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/bastions#Demiplane">Demiplane</a> special facility to the
  character’s <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/bastions">Bastion</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="RealmsLore">Realms Lore</h2>
<p>
  The first appearance of the Forgotten Realms in Dungeons & Dragons was in 1982, and in the decades
  since, thousands of writers, artists, editors, DMs, and players have added to Faerûn’s history and
  cast of characters—a body of knowledge sometimes referred to as “Realms lore.” This book and its
  companion <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"><em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</em></a> give you
  all you need to run a campaign in the Realms, but you might want more. This section provides
  advice on how to use (or not use!) more than forty years’ worth of Realms lore and addresses
  specific challenges Realms lore might pose at the game table.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="RealmsResources">Realms Resources</h3>
<p>
  Abundant resources are available describing many aspects of the Forgotten Realms. The introduction
  lists several adventures and other resources that explore different regions of the Realms. So if
  your characters visit Waterdeep, you can pick up the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/wdh">Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</a> adventure to find a map
  of the city and details about its neighborhoods. All these products are available on
  <a href="dndbeyond.com">DnDBeyond.com</a> for quick reference. Even more Forgotten Realms
  products, from past editions of the game and past eras of the setting’s history, can also be found
  on <a href="dmsguild.com">DMsGuild.com</a>, along with a tremendous amount of fan-created content.
</p>
<p>
  Fan-created sites such as the
  <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Forgotten Realms Wiki</a> collect
  information, art, and maps covering every corner of the setting. Particularly useful are the lists
  of books and other references at the end the wiki articles. You can use these references to dive
  deeper on any topic that interests you.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="YourForgottenRealms">Your Forgotten Realms</h3>
<p>
  The most important thing to know about Realms lore is that you don’t have to know it.
  Improvisation is the most powerful tool in the DM’s toolbox. When your players visit Waterdeep,
  you don’t need the information in <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em>. You can do what every DM does:
  make it up! Make Faerûn your own.
</p>
<p>
  This principle extends to more than just improvising during a session. You can ignore or rewrite
  any of Faerûn’s history to suit your game. Perhaps you want the Red Wizards to be evil
  necromancers, and you want Thay to be a horrifying realm bent on conquest and populated solely by
  undead. That’s not how Thay is described in <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</em>, but that
  doesn’t stop you from making the game you want to play.
</p>
<p>
  For a more nuanced approach, you can simply deemphasize elements of the setting that don’t fit
  your campaign. With this approach, you highlight the aspects of the setting that are important to
  your story, and you let the rest of Faerûn’s history pass by without comment. As an example, you
  might feel the Spellplague and Second Sundering—cataclysmic events that reshaped Faerûn—don’t suit
  your campaign. You can decide Faerûn has long since recovered from these events, so they don’t
  need to affect your campaign. You’re not rewriting the history of Faerûn—you’re picking and
  choosing the elements that make you excited to be a DM in the Forgotten Realms.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ExpertsattheTable">Experts at the Table</h3>
<p>
  Because the Forgotten Realms has such a long history and so many dedicated fans, it’s possible
  someone at your game table knows more about Faerûn than you do. This can be challenging, but you
  can overcome those challenges with communication and preparation.
</p>
<p>
  Talk with Realms lore experts at your table, and share your approach. If you intend to improvise
  your Forgotten Realms or otherwise deviate from existing lore, make that clear to your players so
  they know what to expect.
</p>
<p>
  You can take advantage of player expertise by turning such players into a resource at the table.
  To return to an earlier example, if the characters arrive in Waterdeep and you don’t have an inn
  prepared, you can ask one of the experts at your table, “What inn do you stay at, and what’s
  unique about it?”
</p>
<p>
  You can also use your own knowledge of Realms lore to plant clues in the campaign that experts
  will recognize. When you use characters, locations, magic items, and adversaries from Forgotten
  Realms history, the Realms lore experts at your table will enjoy recognizing the Easter eggs
  you’ve placed. The adventure in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-lost-library-of-lethchauntos/">chapter 7</a> of this book, “The
  Lost Library of Lethchauntos,” is a good example of this strategy. Lethchauntos is a very minor
  character in the history of the Forgotten Realms, but that just makes it all the more memorable
  when a player recognizes his name. At the same time, don’t be afraid to play with expectations and
  keep the players guessing.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="CastofThousands">Cast of Thousands</h3>
<p>
  Faerûn has a reputation for being home to many powerful wizards and other characters. This can be
  an obstacle at the table if your players encounter a problem and expect an NPC like Laeral
  Silverhand, the Blackstaff, or Drizzt to swoop in and take care of things. Your characters might
  even try to locate and recruit such characters, hoping to use them to solve the party’s problems.
</p>
<p>
  But it’s important to keep the adventurers at the center of the story. The weight of Faerûn rests
  on their shoulders alone. No one else can solve their problems for them. If your players begin to
  ask, “Where’s the Chosen of Mystra, and why isn’t she helping?” here are some possible answers.
</p>
<p>
  Talk to your players about this issue. Stress that the campaign is about their characters, not
  illustrious NPCs. While characters in Waterdeep could call on the Blackstaff for aid, this
  sidelines the characters and makes them minor figures in their own story. Encourage players to
  tackle problems themselves and not give away the dramatic spotlight.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the characters have information no one else does, or perhaps they have a connection to the
  antagonist that makes the conflict personal. If the villain’s plan is on a tight schedule, the
  characters might not have time to recruit help. Powerful archmages and rulers might not have the
  patience to listen to outlandish claims from a party of unknown adventurers, let alone believe
  them.
</p>
<p>
  Heroes in the Forgotten Realms often develop rivalries and grudges with villains who return again
  and again. Characters might discover when they try to recruit Laeral Silverhand to their cause
  that she’s busy dealing with Myrkul—again. And, because this sort of rivalry is well understood by
  famous NPCs in the setting, Laeral expects the characters to handle their villainous rival on
  their own, without interference from her or anyone else.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, remember that time marches on. Many of the famous heroes of Faerûn are dead, retired, or
  missing. New heroes are needed now more than ever.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Adventures">Adventures</h2>
<p>
  This chapter includes many adventures set in the Forgotten Realms. These adventures follow the
  format of the adventure examples in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>. As in the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, these adventures are organized by level, with adventures for
  level 1 characters first, followed by adventures for characters of higher levels. To help you find
  the right adventure for your party, the adventures in this chapter are listed in alphabetical
  order in the <a href="#ForgottenRealmsAdventures">Forgotten Realms Adventures table</a> with their
  level and adventure type. The adventure types are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Deity adventures, each involving one of the most important and widely worshiped deities of the
    setting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Faction adventures spotlighting a group such as the Harpers, Red Wizards, or the Zhentarim.
  </li>
  <li>
    High magic adventures detailing magic so powerful just casting the key spell is an adventure.
  </li>
  <li>Region adventures set in one of Faerûn’s broad cultural regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Faerûn’s pantheon of gods, cultural regions, unique magic, and major factions are detailed in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/">Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Each adventure includes a starting situation, a hook to get the characters involved, and key
  encounters (including monsters from the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/mm-2024">Monster Manual</a> or this book). Most of the
  adventures include a map, but some direct you to maps found in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps">appendix B</a> of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. An
  adventure might include other elements, such as a random encounter table or a list of rewards.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these adventures can be completed in a single session, but others might require several
  sessions. Adapt and change the adventures to suit your gaming table and the story you want to
  tell. When the characters try to do something the adventure doesn’t address, improvise!
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AdditionalAdventures">Additional Adventures</h3>
<p>This book contains even more adventures than those in this chapter.</p>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-lost-library-of-lethchauntos/">Chapter 7</a> of this book is a
  complete starting adventure designed for level 1 characters, called “The Lost Library of
  Lethchauntos.” By the time your players have finished this adventure, they should be level 3.
</p>
<p>
  Chapters 2–6 of this book detail particular locations in the Forgotten Realms: the Dalelands,
  Icewind Dale, Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate. Each of these chapters includes
  additional adventures for characters of level 3 or higher. These adventures are also listed on the
  Forgotten Realms Adventure table for ease of reference.

  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> The hamlet of Humble Hill is beset by failing crops, sickly livestock,
  and illness.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The Church of Chauntea has sent Watchful Sister of the Earth Liana (Medium
  [monsters]Priest Acolyte[/monsters]), a human member of the Seeds of Cultivation, to assist. She
  gathers the party and offers them 100 GP each to help her find the root of the sickness.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HumbleHillEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Investigating Humble Hill.</em></strong> The people of Humble Hill are wary of the
  party. Interacting with locals allows the characters to learn the “curse” coincides with a visit
  from a traveling halfling alchemist named Algar Gaunt (Small, Neutral Evil [monsters]Mage
  Apprentice[/monsters]), who sold several farmers a “miraculous growth” fertilizer. The fertilizer
  has corrupted the water table and poisoned crops.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Finding Gaunt.</em></strong> Sister Liana tends the townsfolk and charges the
  characters with finding Gaunt. As the characters search the region, roll on the table below,
  rerolling duplicates. After each encounter, a character can make a DC 15 Intelligence
  ([skill]Investigation[/skill]) check. On a successful check, they find a clue that leads them to
  Gaunt’s lab, which is accessed by way of a stairway leading down from an apparently abandoned
  overgrown shed.

  <strong><em>Gaunt’s Lab.</em></strong> Use the map and features below for Gaunt’s lab:

<p>
  <strong>Ooze Chamber.</strong> A [monsters]Psychic Gray Ooze[/monsters] lurks in puddles of dirty
  water. When characters approach, it initiates combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Laboratory.</strong> Gaunt’s lab notes and equipment can be used to create an antidote to
  the fertilizer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Study.</strong> Gaunt studies his field notes here. If discovered, he tries to flee
  through the trapped hallway and up the ladder in his bedroom, which leads back to the surface.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Trap.</strong> Medium or larger creatures stepping on the pressure plate activate ceiling
  nozzles that spray acid. Creatures in the hall make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6
  Acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a region (sword coast) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 1</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Bandits have settled into ruined towers flanking a road within a day’s
  travel of Baldur’s Gate. Now they stop travelers and demand a toll. They’ve even taken prisoners,
  demanding ransoms for the prisoners’ release.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> A middle-aged human trader named Rolf Twyrtho (Medium
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]) has received a ransom note for his brother Adon, held by the
  bandits. Rolf offers each character 50 GP to bring Adon home and teach the bandits a lesson.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="RobberBaronEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters. All the bandits are human and Medium size.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bandit Stronghold.</em></strong> Use the Dungeon Hideout map in
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#DungeonHideout">appendix B</a>—an arch over the roadway once
  connected these watchtowers. The western stairway on level 1 leads to level 2’s secret exit tunnel
  and the few rooms directly along it; ignore the rest of level 2. Bandits have lived in this
  hideout for weeks, and characters traveling the road spot campfire smoke from the west tower. The
  robbers aren’t bloodthirsty—if they defeat the characters, they’re content to rob them and figure
  out if anyone is worth ransoming.
</p>
<p>
  Characters who search the area more broadly might discover a hidden entrance to the lair of the
  robbers. This hole in the hillside, covered with brush, is the secret exit found on level 2 of the
  map.
</p>
<p>
  Mardon Rueh (Medium [monsters]Spy[/monsters]) is the bandit leader. He carries keys to the locked
  areas on level 1. His sister, Wendi Rueh (Medium [monsters]Priest Acolyte[/monsters]), tries to
  prevent anyone from dying, even hostages or the characters. The Ruehs were once aristocrats and
  were ruined by the Eomanes, a rival family the Ruehs accused of devil worship. Mardon intends to
  use money gained from banditry to hire mercenaries and take revenge. If given the chance, Mardon
  tells his story to the party and he might even hire the characters to be his agents. For more on
  the Eomanes, see the “Eomane House” section and the adventure “Blood Night” in chapter 6.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fallen Archway.</em></strong> Caldwell (Medium [monsters]Tough[/monsters]) and his pet
  [monsters]Mastiff[/monsters] keep watch on the road. A total of three
  [monsters]Bandit;Bandits[/monsters] and one [monsters]Scout[/monsters] lurk in the ruined
  guardhouses to either side, but they’re bored and [rules]Indifferent[/rules], talking to each
  other and occasionally leaving the building to speak with Caldwell or play with the dog. Caldwell
  is [rules]Hostile[/rules] and demands a toll of 3 GP from each passerby, but he’s willing to
  barter. At any impasse in talks, the robbers insist on more money. If the party doesn’t relent,
  the robbers reluctantly begin combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>East Tower.</em></strong> Mardon lives in a rough office and bedroom set up in this
  tower. In the northeastern barrack, three Bandits rest. A room in the southeast corner built
  around the oiled, polished stump of an ancient oak houses Wendi Rueh, Mardon’s sister. She reveres
  Oghma and has placed a wooden symbol of Oghma atop the stump. Battle sounds bring everyone into
  the fray. Journals and other documents in these rooms tell the story of the Rueh family and their
  vendetta with the Eomanes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>West Tower.</em></strong> Three [monsters]Bandit;Bandits[/monsters] and one
  [monsters]Mastiff[/monsters] relax around a campfire in this tower, which is in much worse
  condition than the eastern one. They keep a lax watch on the stairway down, which they’ve covered
  with wooden boards. The stairway is unstable. Characters who move at no more than half their Speed
  on a turn use it safely. Otherwise, the stairs crumble and all creatures on the stairs fall 10
  feet to level 1, alerting everyone in west level 1 (below).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>East Level 1.</em></strong> The eastern section of the hideout houses castoff junk and
  three locked prison cells with one prisoner, Adon Twyrtho (Medium [monsters]Warrior
  Infantry[/monsters]). Adon is eager to escape, but he admits to being treated well while he waited
  to be ransomed. He points out that the bandits pass through this area when they change shifts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Central Level 1.</em></strong> To the east of this pillared hall, rubble chokes a
  stairway. To the west, a similar stair leads to an escape tunnel with a brush-covered entrance on
  a hillside. A locked southwestern room holds most of the bandits’ loot and supplies, including the
  following:
</p>
<p>380 CP, 630 SP, 120 GP, and 26 PP</p>
<p>Six tigereye gems, worth 10 GP each</p>
<p>[magicitems]Potion of Climbing[/magicitems]</p>
<p>[magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of [spells]See Invisibility[/spells]</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>West Level 1.</em></strong> One [monsters]Tough[/monsters], one
  [monsters]Scout[/monsters], one [monsters]Mastiff[/monsters], and three
  [monsters]Bandit;Bandits[/monsters] rest or socialize in the barrack here. These combatants
  respond quickly to the sounds of fighting or a shouted alarm from the floor above.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If the party agrees to help Mardon and Wendi get justice on
  the Eomanes and regain their rightful position in Baldur’s Gate, Mardon releases Adon. As long as
  Adon is freed, Rolf makes good on his promised payment.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheSiegeofShalespirePriory">The Siege of Shalespire Priory</h3>
<p><em>Defend a temple from bloodthirsty goblins.</em></p>
<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a faction (order of the gauntlet) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 2</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Raiders commanded by the [monsters]Hobgoblin Captain[/monsters] Lac
  the Breaker lay siege to the Priory of Shalespire, a place of shelter for travelers and pilgrimage
  site for the faithful of Lathander.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The characters are resting at the priory as the raiders are spotted. The
  monks and clergy won’t survive without the party’s help and desperately ask for aid.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ShalespireEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>
  The encounters listed below outline the siege. Use the priory map below. The south and west areas
  of the temple are built into the adjacent hillside.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Everyone, Inside!</em></strong> War horns blare as raiders rush the priory grounds.
  Three [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] and a [monsters]Goblin Boss[/monsters],
  all riding [monsters]Wolf;Wolves[/monsters], attempt to ride down a dozen panicked
  [monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters] running for the safety of the priory. Monks release
  messenger pigeons requesting reinforcement, a day’s ride away. The raiders, a hundred strong,
  surround the priory.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Siege Begins.</em></strong> An [monsters]Ogre[/monsters], wielding a battering ram
  and backed up by three [monsters]Hobgoblin Warrior;Hobgoblin Warriors[/monsters], attempts to
  force the main door. Meanwhile, three [monsters]Bugbear Warrior;Bugbear Warriors[/monsters] hide
  in the courtyard to ambush anyone who attempts to escape the priory. If the party defeats both
  groups, the raiders fall back, building a camp. Otherwise, defenders abandon the temple,
  retreating into the shelter of the sanctuary and living quarters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Reprieve.</em></strong> The party has a chance to take a Short Rest. The characters
  might bolster the faith and courage of civilians trapped in the priory, reinforce doors, make
  barricades, and set improvised traps for invaders. Four [magicitems]Potion of Healing;Potions of
  Healing[/magicitems] are stored in the vault. The sanctuary is protected by a
  [spells]Hallow[/spells] spell. It blocks Fiends from entering, and Humanoids in the sanctuary
  can’t gain the [condition]Frightened[/condition] condition. A [monsters]Priest Acolyte[/monsters]
  at the priory can heal one creature.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Overnight Assault.</em></strong> Lac’s forces make many assaults on the priory. Use
  the groups below in any order or combination. Each is a low-difficulty encounter; for a
  high-difficulty encounter, combine two groups:
</p>
<p>
  Four [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] and a [monsters]Goblin Boss[/monsters]
</p>
<p>
  Three [monsters]Hobgoblin Warrior;Hobgoblin Warriors[/monsters] and a [monsters]Worg[/monsters]
</p>
<p>A [monsters]Bugbear Warrior[/monsters] and four [monsters]Wolf;Wolves[/monsters]</p>
<p>Two [monsters]Ogrillon Ogre;Ogrillon Ogres[/monsters]</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Predawn.</em></strong> Just before sunup, Lac sends six [monsters]Hobgoblin
  Warrior;Hobgoblin Warriors[/monsters] in to soften up the characters, entering battle after these
  minions are defeated.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Sun Rises.</em></strong> A troop of mounted [monsters]Knight;Knights[/monsters]
  led by a [monsters]Priest[/monsters] of Lathander arrives at dawn. The characters can sally forth
  to rout the remaining raiders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Each character is awarded a gold symbol of Lathander set
  with a ruby and worth 100 GP. Each character’s Renown Score with the Order of the Gauntlet
  increases by 1.

  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> During a recent new moon, fisherfolk in Leilon heard sobbing on Idol
  Island, and Valdi Estapaar, the local fishery boss, took a small group there. She discovered a
  weeping statue alongside a shrine. Mist then covered the isle, and Valdi and her helpers
  retreated. Since then, grieving people in Leilon have forgotten much of their past while also
  becoming darker of mood.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Merrygold Brightshine, priest of Leilon’s Lathander shrine, suspects Shar’s
  involvement. Merrygold and Valdi ask the characters to investigate the weeping statue. Valdi
  provides a <a href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#LargeVehicles">Rowboat</a> (see the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a>), and Merrygold provides
  four [magicitems]Potion of Healing;Potions of Healing[/magicitems].
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="WeepingGoddessEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Raven Run.</em></strong> As characters leave for Idol Island, they are followed by a
  large flock of ravens, animals sacred to Shar. Eventually, the birds swoop down and initiate
  combat. They include three [monsters]Swarm of Ravens;Swarms of Ravens[/monsters] and a fourth
  group infused with shadow magic ([monsters]Swarm of Stirges[/monsters]).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gloom Mist.</em></strong> Mist around Idol Island dampens nonmagical lights and
  cantrips so they create only [rules]Dim Light[/rules]. Five sobbing
  [monsters]Shadow;Shadows[/monsters] ambush the characters as the group nears the shore.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Weeping Goddess.</em></strong> As the party approaches a rough statue fronting an old
  shrine, sounds of weeping emanate from it. If the group lingers, the crying ceases, and three
  [monsters]Kenku[/monsters] and a [monsters]Cultist Fanatic[/monsters] loyal to Shar, who were
  making the weeping noises, emerge from the shrine and order the characters to leave or die.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Entryways.</em></strong> This area has two entrances to the sanctum. A hole opens in
  the shrine’s southern wall, leading to a flooded tunnel. The shrine’s altar conceals a standard
  secret door (DC 15 to detect), leading to a dry secret passage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Flooded Tunnel.</em></strong> Darkness and cloudy water fill this tunnel. Two
  [monsters]Lacedon Ghoul;Lacedon Ghouls[/monsters] have been attracted to the deathly magic here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sanctum.</em></strong> Within this sanctuary, which also serves as a barrack, an
  obsidian pillar glows with violet light. Irric (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Priest[/monsters])
  dwells here along with three <strong>[monsters]Kenku[/monsters].</strong> Irric uses the pillar to
  draw sorrow from townsfolk to offer to Shar, hoping she’ll break the curse on his kenku followers.
  During battle, stolen grief manifests as a weeping <strong>[monsters]Shadow[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> On Irric’s defeat, Shar withdraws her power from the pillar,
  which returns to normal but blackened stone. The shadows and gloomy mist on Idol Island vanish, as
  do the unnaturally aggressive ravens. Townsfolk return to normal, and Merrygold and Valdi are
  grateful.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> In Laughing Hollow—a fey-touched valley in the Savage Frontier, just
  east of Daggerford—demonic fungus has invaded a sacred grove.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> A wood elf druid from Laughing Hollow traditionally visits the shrine of
  Chauntea in the nearby village of Julkoun at the spring festival of Greengrass to bless crops and
  sow harmony between Julkouners and the fey of the valley. This year, no druid has come. Deena
  Bluecreek, the village’s halfling lord-mayor, turns to the party to make sure all is well.

<p>
  <strong><em>Wood Elves.</em></strong> As the characters enter Laughing Hollow, three blighted wood
  elves (Medium [monsters]Spy;Spies[/monsters]) ambush them. They come to their senses when
  [rules]Bloodied[/rules] and surrender. After pointing the group to the blighted grove, they rush
  to warn their community and seek a cure.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sacred Grove.</em></strong> Use the map below. Mycelial fibers run through the brush
  and drape branches. Spores form a light fog. Fungus becomes denser closer to the center, casting
  the forest in misty gloom.
</p>
<p>Myconids here are Chaotic Evil, infected with demonic ichor:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Outer Circle.</strong> [rules]Dim Light[/rules] palls the outer circle of the grove. A
  [monsters]Gas Spore Fungus[/monsters], three [monsters]Violet Fungus;Violet Fungi[/monsters], two
  [monsters]Myconid Adult;Myconid Adults[/monsters], and five [monsters]Myconid Sprout;Myconid
  Sprouts[/monsters] oppose the characters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Inner Circle.</strong> A mycelial web and spore-laden mist block light coming from
  overhead. Within the [rules]Darkness[/rules] lurk a [monsters]Gas Spore Fungus[/monsters], two
  [monsters]Myconid Adult;Myconid Adults[/monsters], and three
  <strong>[monsters]Myconid Spore Servant;Myconid Spore Servants[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fungal Hollow.</strong> A moat and permeable bulb of fungal strands surrounds the central
  henge and grove. Within, a [monsters]Myconid Sovereign[/monsters] rests in layered cups of giant
  mushrooms, shining with blood-colored light. A [monsters]Myconid Spore Servant[/monsters] dressed
  as a druid stands guard, as does a [monsters]Druid[/monsters] who is blighted but surrenders when
  Bloodied.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> With the sovereign’s defeat, the blight ends. A group of
  wood elves arrives and thanks the characters, helping them recover from the ordeal. Each
  character’s Renown Score with the Emerald Enclave increases by 1.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a deity (ilmater) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 3</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A cult devoted to Orcus has hidden a demonic stone in a basalt quarry
  in the village of Helmsdale in Damara. The stone gives off waves of magical fear and despair,
  overwhelming workers and transforming some into Undead. A monk of the Yellow Rose monastery,
  Brother Trasig, investigated the quarry but has never returned.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Helmsdale’s town elders, distraught over Trasig’s disappearance, offer 300
  GP for the characters to investigate the quarry and learn his fate. They believe the quarry is
  cursed and have no knowledge of the stone hidden in its depths.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TenebrousStormEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>Use the quarry map below for this adventure. The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Work Area.</em></strong> Just inside the quarry lurk five
  [monsters]Zombie;Zombies[/monsters], two [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters], and a
  <strong>[monsters]Ghast[/monsters].</strong> Once laborers here, they were corrupted by the stone
  but continue to swing picks and drive shovels in pointless labor. They fight anyone who disturbs
  them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ambush.</em></strong> Sarbrindar, a [monsters]Wight[/monsters] clad in robes decorated
  with Orcus’s symbol, hides behind a wagon to ambush the party. He’s accompanied by two
  [monsters]Skeleton;Skeletons[/monsters] of former workers. The skeletons fight from high ground.
  Sarbrindar singles out one character for mockery and insults, gleefully fighting until destroyed.
  Brother Trasig’s broken body is partially buried behind nearby crates, clutching a
  [magicitems]Periapt of Health[/magicitems]. The cause of the transformations is concealed behind
  an illusory wall. If the illusion is touched, it vanishes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hidden Cavity.</em></strong> Within the hidden cavity, the cult has hidden a relic
  called the Tenebrous Stone. As the characters enter, each is subjected to a vision of a past
  failure. Roleplay through each of these scenes, inviting players to describe the failure and what
  their character did or didn’t do in the past. A demonic figure appears in each vision, taunting
  the character. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw can change the tragic
  outcome of their vision; a character who fails experiences the tragedy all over again.
</p>
<p>
  When every vision has resolved, the characters return to their senses, and the demonic figure of
  their visions manifests as a <strong>[monsters]Succubus[/monsters].</strong> The succubus is
  [rules]Vulnerable[/rules] to all damage from characters who succeeded on the save and changed the
  outcome of their vision, but characters who failed that save and experienced a tragic outcome
  again have the [condition]Frightened[/condition] condition instead.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If the succubus is defeated, the Tenebrous Stone loses its
  power, and the quarry returns to normal over several days.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="DisinterredDanger">Disinterred Danger</h3>
<p><em>Recover dangerous treasures hidden by the Harpers.</em></p>
<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a faction (harpers) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 4</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> After a battle long ago, Harpers sealed cursed magic items in a false
  tomb. The Zhentarim has found the site’s location.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Folavani Ladril, a wood elf scout and Harper, tried to defend the tomb but
  had to flee. Exhausted and due to report to her leaders, she asks the characters to go to the tomb
  and bring back the cursed items.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DisinterredDangerEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Site Features.</em></strong> The site, its magic weakened but unbroken, has endured
  more than a century. Harpers left various clues in each area; a character who takes a
  [action]Study[/action] action and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([skill]History[/skill]) check
  recognizes a Harper clue’s meaning.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Entryway.</em></strong> Zhents found the tomb, its door hidden in a small cave. Signs
  of an explosion (caused by a discharged [spells]Glyph of Warding[/spells] spell) mar the cave and
  the broken doorway, once carved as a graceful tree. Zhentarim corpses lie scattered on the floor.
  A [monsters]Wraith[/monsters] drifts out of the tomb and initiates combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nethertide Leavings.</em></strong> Orc equipment and bones form a pile near a bronze
  floor plate that reads, in Common, “Along Selûne’s path they did walk, leaving no stone unturned.”
  This is a Harper clue, and a character who recognizes it knows it refers to “Moonlight Paean,” a
  famous ballad. A character who recites the ballad causes silver light to bathe the chamber,
  revealing a [magicitems]Shield of Missile Attraction[/magicitems] and a [magicitems]Sword of
  Vengeance[/magicitems] lying among the bones. Other treasures and art objects here amount to a CR
  4 random treasure hoard. Disturbing these items without first reciting the ballad causes bones to
  animate and ambush the characters (two [monsters]Swarm of Crawling Claws;Swarms of Crawling
  Claws[/monsters] and seven [monsters]Crawling Claw;Crawling Claws[/monsters]).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dragon Statue.</em></strong> Two pressure plates trigger this fire-casting statue (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>). A wall carving of a
  musician playing, notes issuing from his lute while he dances around the statue, is a Harper clue.
  Characters who recognize it know the tune depicted: “Coggin’s Reel.” Playing or humming this tune
  disarms the trap.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tomb.</em></strong> This stone coffin is locked with the [spells]Arcane Lock[/spells]
  spell. Its lid reads, in Elvish, “To shine a light on the future.” This is a Harper clue. A
  character who recognizes it knows the response: “Study the past.” This phrase is the password for
  the arcane lock. Within the coffin is [magicitems]Demon Armor[/magicitems] that animates and
  fights; use the stat block for a <strong>[monsters]Cambion[/monsters].</strong> If the proper
  phrase was spoken, the armor starts the combat [rules]Bloodied[/rules].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Folavani helps remove curses from cursed characters. Each
  character’s Renown Score with the Harpers increases by 1.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A coven of hags in a hidden cave are flooding the Drowned Forest of
  Calidyrr, threatening nearby villages.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Gwyer Destrian (Medium [monsters]Druid[/monsters]), a wizened Ffolk in the
  village of Doncastle, asks up-and-coming heroes to find the cause of the flooding.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DrowningForestEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Exploring the Forest.</em></strong> A wooded swamp just west of Doncastle, the Drowned
  Forest was once 12 miles long and half as wide. It has expanded 2 miles on every side and grown
  more dangerous. For every 2 hours the party spends exploring the swamp, roll on the table below,
  rerolling duplicates.

<p>
  Creatures in encounters 1–4 on the table are loyal to the hags. They might admit to serving them
  and describe where the coven is located or, alternatively, take captured characters there.
</p>
<p>
  One creature in each group carries a magical talisman made of foul natural materials. A talisman
  allows its bearer to see through magic protecting the coven’s cave.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Coven Bluff.</em></strong> The coven lairs in a rocky cavern from which water
  perpetually flows, near the swamp’s center. Near the cavern, webs cover dead trees. Use the map
  and features below:

<p>
  <strong>Outside Guardians<em>.</em></strong> Two [monsters]Ettercap;Ettercaps[/monsters] and three
  [monsters]Giant Spider;Giant Spiders[/monsters] keep watch.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Veiled Entrance.</strong> Only characters holding one of the coven’s talismans can see the
  waterfall entrance to the coven’s cave.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Coven.</strong> Inside the bluff, three [monsters]Green Hag;Green
  Hags[/monsters]—Lette, Matt, and Solena—work their magic on a cauldron gushing foul water. The
  cauldron has the powers of a [magicitems]Decanter of Endless Water[/magicitems].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> With the hags defeated, the waters recede. Gwyer asks for
  their cauldron, from which he and his circle can make the party a real
  <em>Decanter of Endless Water</em>.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> In the woods outside the village of Feather Falls, the [monsters]Night
  Hag[/monsters] Mother Gloam has trapped a fragment of Lathander’s power within a stone obelisk.
  The village is surrounded by unnatural gloom. Crops are failing, and despair hangs over the
  people.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Dawnbringer Fenna (Medium [monsters]Priest Acolyte[/monsters]), a human
  devotee of Lathander, has received a vision directing her to a grove near the village. She offers
  300 GP to any party willing to secure the site and bring back the sun.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LostDawnEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>
  Use the map below for these encounters. The interior of the grove is in [rules]Darkness[/rules].
  Light sources that would create [rules]Bright Light[/rules] create [rules]Dim Light[/rules]
  instead.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Entering the Grove.</em></strong> The entrance to the grove is guarded by three
  [monsters]Cultist Fanatic;Cultist Fanatics[/monsters] and a
  <strong>[monsters]Specter[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Obelisk of Night.</em></strong> A stone obelisk marked with runes stands in the
  central clearing of the grove. Mother Gloam has trapped an <strong>Empyrean Iota</strong> within
  the obelisk. To free it, the characters must collect three runestones from elsewhere in the grove
  and place them into recesses on the obelisk’s surface. When all three runestones are in their
  places, the obelisk shatters, the empyrean bursts free, and dawn comes to the village.
</p>
<p>
  If the characters haven’t yet fought Mother Gloam, she confronts them when they bring the third
  runestone to the clearing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gathering Runestones.</em></strong> The three runestones—smooth, flat tiles shaped
  like the central obelisk and each carved with a single rune—are placed on withered stumps at
  different places along the paths surrounding the central clearing. One is in the southwest corner
  where the path bends sharply. The second is in the southeast corner, where the path rises along a
  small hillside and comes to an end. The third is on the east side, where a smaller clearing is
  lined with vibrant purple fungus.

  <strong><em>Amphail Arrival.</em></strong> Lord Ilzimmer greets the party and hosts them in his
  Stone Stallion inn. He tells the party that he doesn’t want to choose sides, but the deep-rooted
  Oglyntyr family blames newcomers the Hemzars, who train dangerous creatures—Strem Hemzar recently
  slew an owlbear on Hemzar Ranch. But Riven Oglyntyr, who left decades ago to adventure, returned
  not long ago and could be involved. He needs an outside party to investigate.

  Strem slew a bloody owlbear a few weeks ago and has been ill ever since. The owlbear was sent by
  Malar, who cursed Strem to be a werewolf. He convalesces in the manor tower, and he and his family
  chain him up there at night, keeping the truth of his condition a secret.
</p>
<p>
  The Hemzars assume Strem contracted lycanthropy from the owlbear. A character who takes a
  [action]Study[/action] action and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([skill]Religion[/skill]) check
  recalls Malar sends blood-covered beasts out into the world, and he takes umbrage when they’re
  slain. Searching the Hemzar manor turns up an ivory idol of Malar in one of the barns, but the
  Hemzars don’t know where it came from.

  The family’s four remaining servants are <strong>[monsters]Wererat;Wererats[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sacred Hunt.</em></strong> When the party begins investigating the Oglyntyrs, the
  family pretends to cooperate and blames the Hemzars. But as the party discovers the shrine or
  otherwise gets close to the truth, the Oglyntyrs decide to kill the party and honor Malar by
  making them the object of a hunt. The family stalks the characters and harries them in the
  wilderness.

<p>Use the following encounters, giving the party time to recover between each.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dorn alongside Mirin.</li>
  <li>
    Jhess and two servants. If Bloodied, these lycanthropes flee back to the ranch or surrender.

  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Lord Ilzimmer is displeased if the Oglyntyrs come to harm,

  <strong>Situation.</strong> A bandit gang called the Eyes of At’ar has kidnapped Sullivan Crase,
  an antiquarian employed by Candlekeep. The gang offers to exchange Sullivan for 10,000 GP,
  instructing that the exchange take place at a lonely caravansary along the Black Road called
  Kozah’s Whisper.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Janussi (Medium [monsters]Archmage[/monsters]), Candlekeep’s Keeper of
  Tomes, meets the characters in a private room at a tavern in Baldur’s Gate and shares with them
  the ransom note detailing the gang’s demands. The Eyes of At’ar write they will be at Kozah’s
  Whisper in one month and will wait one month more for Candlekeep’s representatives to make the
  trade. After that, Sullivan will be killed. Janussi confides that Sullivan was carrying a scroll
  of priceless Netherese magic when he was abducted. She refuses to encourage the bandits by paying
  the ransom. She offers the party 1,500 GP plus expenses if they will travel to Kozah’s Whisper and
  secure Sullivan and the scroll.

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EyesofAtarEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Doing Their Homework.</em></strong> Characters might seek to use Candlekeep’s
  resources to learn more about their mission. Anyone wishing to enter the library must provide a
  work of writing the library doesn’t already have. Characters researching in the library learn the
  gang’s name refers to At’ar the Merciless, the Bedine god of the sun. Characters can acquire maps
  suggesting possible routes to Anauroch. An obscure scouting report describes the leader of the
  Eyes of At’ar as a mysterious “half-lion” spellcaster named Inixera ([monsters]Lamia[/monsters]).
  The report cautions that the gang has eyes everywhere. You can find more information on Candlekeep
  to flesh out this part of the adventure in the

</p>
<a href="/sources/dnd/cm"> </a>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/cm"
    ><strong><em>The Journey.</em></strong> The characters have a long journey ahead of them. One
    option is to take the Trade Way north to Daggerford, then turn east along the Delimbyr Trail
    until they reach the Black Road and Anauroch. Alternatively, the party might travel
    cross-country, skirting the Forest of Wyrms, Marsh of Chelimber, and Lonely Moor. Use the rules
    for travel and journey stages in </a
  ><a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/running-the-game">chapter 2</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Kozah’s Whisper.</em></strong> Kozah’s Whisper is a caravansary halfway along the
  Black Road, in the middle of the Great Desert. Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#RoadsideInn">Roadside Inn map</a> from appendix B of the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. Characters who used magic to travel to Kozah’s Whisper might get
  there before the bandits, but its more likely the gang has already arrived.
</p>
<p>
  The caravansary is managed by a human woman named Enla Massine (Medium, Chaotic Neutral
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]) who has survived in Anauroch by not getting involved in the
  business of her guests. She is assisted by her wife, Nari (Medium [monsters]Assassin[/monsters]),
  who serves as a bouncer and general laborer. The two are fiercely loyal to each other. Their three
  adult children (Medium [monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters]) work as cooks, grooms, and
  cleaning staff. Other guests at the caravansary include the following:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lorna</strong>, a nosy human merchant (Medium [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]) lingering at
  Kozah’s Rest while her pack animals recover from a difficult journey. Lorna is a source for gossip
  at the caravansary, and she can sell the party any gear they might need, including a few
  [magicitems]Spell Scroll;Spell Scrolls[/magicitems].
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mikkam</strong>, a halfling lieutenant in the Eyes of At’ar (Small, Chaotic Neutral
  [monsters]Tough Boss[/monsters]). He leads eight
  <strong>[monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Nama</strong>, a wandering elf mage (Medium [monsters]Bandit Deceiver[/monsters]) pursuing
  lost Netherese lore. If Nama learns about the Netherese scriptures, she might offer her services
  to the party in exchange for the scroll—or simply try to steal it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Raheel</strong>, a human tracker (Medium [monsters]Scout[/monsters]). Raheel is looking
  for work. The party can hire him for 100 GP. He will spy on the Eyes of At’ar or anyone else the
  party directs him to, but he avoids combat.
</p>
<p>
  The party has time to investigate the caravansary and guests while meeting with Mikkam to set up
  the exchange. Once convinced the party intends to make the deal, Mikkam sends word to Inixera,
  leader of the gang, at a bandit camp half a day away in the desert.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Exchange.</em></strong> Inixera arrives a day after being sent for, with the bulk
  of the gang in tow. This includes four [monsters]Bandit Captain;Bandit Captains[/monsters] and two
  dozen [monsters]Bandit;Bandits[/monsters], and Gnasher, Inixera’s pet
  <strong>[monsters]Manticore[/monsters].</strong> Sullivan is manacled and gagged, in Gnasher’s
  care. Inixera has the Netherese texts in an elaborate scroll case, hidden in a simple sack.
</p>
<p>
  When Inixera confronts the party, he changes the terms of the deal. He will release Sullivan if
  the party agrees to read the scroll aloud, right now, in the open yard of the caravansary. Inixera
  has read the scriptures and knows they summon a [monsters]Phaerimm Agent[/monsters]. If the
  characters go through with this bargain, the phaerimm appears and fights them while Inixera looks
  on, cackling with glee. If they refuse, Inixera intends to feed Sullivan to Gnasher and keep the
  scrolls for himself.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Rendel Carver (Medium [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]), the human
  husband of a prominent Zhentarim leader, has been kidnapped by a rival crime gang and is being
  held at a safe house in the city.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The Zhentarim leader instructs the characters to rescue Rendel and enact
  revenge on the kidnappers.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SafeHouseEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Finding the House.</em></strong> Bribes of 100 GP spread around informers in the city
  get the party the location of the safe house and the name Yathla Kresh (Medium, Neutral Evil
  [monsters]Bandit Deceiver[/monsters]), an aspiring human crime lord and expert illusionist, who is
  behind the abduction. Alternatively, a character can get this information by spending an hour
  interrogating petty criminals and succeeding at a DC 15 Charisma ([skill]Intimidation[/skill] or
  [skill]Persuasion[/skill]) check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Safe House.</em></strong> Use the map below. Doors begin closed. See “Hallway Fights”
  below for additional guidance:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1: Stairs.</strong> Yathla is at the foot of the stairs talking with four of her
  [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] near the front door.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2: Gambling Room.</strong> Four [monsters]Spy;Spies[/monsters] in Yathla’s employ play
  cards here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3: Prisoner Room.</strong> Rendel is tied to a chair here. Two of Yathla’s
  [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] relax and talk in the room to the south.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4: Trap.</strong> A tripwire on the upper floor triggers a fusillade of poison darts in
  the space marked “T” on the map. Creatures in the 5-foot-by-10-foot space directly north of the
  trap are affected by the poison dart trap from
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#PoisonedDarts">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>, scaled for level 5
  characters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5: Vault.</strong> The door to this room is locked with the [spells]Arcane Lock[/spells]
  spell, opening only for Yathla. It contains a CR 5–10 treasure hoard, plus a [magicitems]Spell
  Scroll[/magicitems] of [spells]Dimension Door[/spells], which Yathla intends to use to escape the
  safe house.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hallway Fights.</em></strong> Any criminal in the house can shout an alarm, so
  characters are likely to face enemies simultaneously charging out of various rooms. At the same
  time, Yathla flees up the stairs towards the vault, leading characters following too closely into
  the trap on the upper floor. A session might involve the party splitting up, some chasing Yathla
  while others deal with the gang and search for Rendel. Track Initiative for everyone even as they
  spread out around the house.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If Rendel is rescued, each character’s Renown Score with the
  Zhentarim increases by 1.

  <strong>Situation.</strong> A group of fey and other forest dwellers angry at overhunting and
  logging in the forest have intercepted a caravan under the protection of Helm’s Everwatch Knights.
  The caravan was bound for the village of Noanar’s Hold on the north edge of the High Forest, and
  carries critical winter supplies, but now the forest folk hold it hostage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Desperate for a solution, the village’s human mayor Nolan Foxglove (Medium
  [monsters]Noble[/monsters]) offers the party 3,000 GP in gemstones to locate the missing caravan
  and secure its return. Foxglove and others in the village consider the forest folk lawless
  brigands.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ShadowEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Scene of the Crime.</em></strong> The caravan ambush site is several miles from town,
  in the forest. Footprints and drag marks suggest the caravan members were taken prisoner and the
  supplies nabbed. The party can follow this trail to the forest camp.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Forest Ambush.</em></strong> Fey defenders of the forest wait along the way. The group
  consists of a [monsters]Goblin Hexer[/monsters], a [monsters]Satyr Revelmaster[/monsters], and
  three <strong>[monsters]Bugbear Stalker;Bugbear Stalkers[/monsters].</strong> They fight while
  shouting insults at the party for abetting the selfish destruction of the forest. When one is
  killed, the rest retreat to the forest camp.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Marks of Civilization.</em></strong> Characters traveling through the woods note
  excessive logging, cruel animal traps, and a dearth of local wildlife, suggesting the fey have a
  point.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Forest Camp.</em></strong> Use the map below. The camp’s inhabitants and main features
  are listed below:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Main Gate.</strong> Two [monsters]Bugbear Stalker;Bugbear Stalkers[/monsters] stand watch
  on each southern tower. They alert the camp to intruders before engaging in combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hostage Tent.</strong> Ironhoof, a [monsters]Centaur Warden[/monsters], guards two human
  drovers ([monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters]) and Pryat Tomes (Medium, Lawful Good
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters]), a human member of the Everwatch Knights. Pryat hopes to negotiate a
  truce between Noanar’s Hold and the fey.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Camp Residents.</strong> Four [monsters]Druid;Druids[/monsters] rest in the sleeping tent.
  The paddock houses a <strong>[monsters]Primeval Owlbear[/monsters].</strong> A [monsters]Pixie
  Wonderbringer[/monsters] named Spirella Rainbloom leads the group and moves about the camp.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fists or Friends.</em></strong> The characters might sneak or force their way into the
  camp, but negotiation is possible. Spirella is initially [rules]Hostile[/rules] but agrees to
  return the supplies and free the prisoners in exchange for a binding agreement from locals that
  the forest will not be hunted or logged until the damage already done has healed. This could take
  many years.

  <strong>Situation.</strong> The Spellplague caused a ruined tower near Secomber, once used for the

  monsters and evil magic. A ranger of the Order of the Shooting Star (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"

<a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/">
  <p>
    <strong>Hooks.</strong> Uvdi Sarsk, a Mystran priest, contacts the characters and asks them to

    inverted tower and told her its location, but she hasn’t heard from him since. She wants the
    party to investigate.
  </p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="WellofLiesEncounters">Encounters</h4>
  <p>
    The characters reach the inverted tower in a few days. The adventure consists of these
    encounters.

</a>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong><em>Wild Magic.</em></strong> The inside of the tower is a wild magic zone. See </a

  zones.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Living Menhirs.</em></strong> Outside the inverted tower, menhirs and rubble swirl in
  the air, combining into a creature that defends the entrance. Use the [monsters]Air
  Elemental[/monsters] stat block but change its creature type to Construct. When the creature drops
  to 0 Hit Points, the last menhir animates (use the [monsters]Galeb Duhr[/monsters] stat block).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Initiation Well.</em></strong> The tower once had a level for each school of magic.
  Only four levels remain, listed from the top to the bottom:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Transmutation.</strong> Open to the sky, the transmutation level has three
  [monsters]Awakened Tree;Awakened Trees[/monsters] and a
  <strong>[monsters]Animated Rug of Smothering[/monsters].</strong> A Cyric
  [monsters]Berserker[/monsters] watching the entry joins any combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Necromancy.</strong> Rough exam tables fill this level. A [monsters]Ghast
  Gravecaller[/monsters] and three [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters] converse with a
  <strong>[monsters]Cultist Fanatic[/monsters].</strong> They study the dead remains of Keadan, his
  three comrades, and two slain cultists.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Illusion.</strong> This level subjects invaders to an illusory maze, but the magic fades
  as two [monsters]Cultist Fanatic;Cultist Fanatics[/monsters], two [monsters]Tough Boss;Tough
  Bosses[/monsters], and four [monsters]Cultist;Cultists[/monsters] use the illusions to surprise
  interlopers. The area is a barrack stocked with supplies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Conjuration.</strong> On this level, a human man named Nacrel (Medium, Chaotic Evil
  [monsters]Mage[/monsters]) works inside a runic circle, experimenting with a floating silvery-blue
  orb of energy connected to Weave threads. His allied [monsters]Nightmare[/monsters] lurks in the
  southern tunnel, which leads outside. The orb can be disrupted with a [spells]Dispel
  Magic[/spells] spell (DC 17) or by slaying Nacrel. Until the orb fails, Nacrel regains 5 Hit
  Points at the start of each of his turns, provided he has at least 1 Hit Point remaining.
</p>

  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Uvdi Sarsk rewards each character with an Uncommon magic
  item.

  >[monsters]Aberrant Cultist[/monsters]), a tiefling who reveres Beshaba, led Taydan to blame Sune
  and steal a ruby rose from Sune’s Temple of Beauty in Waterdeep. Reyla and Taydan destroyed every

  party to the Passion Pools, they and their elk minions fight the party there.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong><em>Passion Pools.</em></strong> These caves in the forested foothills of the Sword
    Mountains protect geothermic pools laced with salts that color the waters various hues of red.

  <strong><em>Love’s Warning.</em></strong> The [monsters]Ghost[/monsters] of Baranys Dwyll, once an

  the site’s dangers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Foul Waters.</em></strong> The ritual Reyla and Taydan are performing has befouled the
  pools. Any creature that enters a pool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bad Toad.</em></strong> Moro, Reyla’s [monsters]Quasit[/monsters] familiar, keeps
  watch within the pools and might be discovered by characters at any time. Moro claims to be an
  innocent awakened toad in need of protection. If allowed to accompany the party or taken along
  with them, Moro causes “accidental” trouble until it has an excuse to join a fight against the
  party. For example, Moro might make noise when the party is trying to be sneaky, or it might
  profess to know the way through the pools and then lead the party into an ambush. If left behind
  or attacked, Moro turns [condition]Invisible[/condition] and harasses the group unseen.

  <strong><em>Polluted Pool.</em></strong> Using Abyssal reagents gathered from demons at the site,

  Beshaba. They pause to destroy intruders. Three swarms of fiendish cockroaches ([monsters]Swarm of

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a region (lands of intrigue) adventure for</p>

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> The ghost ship <em>Bloodrider</em> terrorizes shipping from a hidden
  port. Its undead crew leaves no survivors, and the surge in piracy is unexplained.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The human merchant captain Shireen Malahnk (Medium [monsters]Bandit
  Captain[/monsters]) wants extra guards for her ship, <em>Wisteria</em>, hauling metal and gems
  from Athkatla to Baldur’s Gate. She offers 250 GP per person.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HellShipEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bloodrider.</em></strong> The wind dies and sulfurous fog gathers as the
  fire-blackened <em>Bloodrider</em> sails in. The ghost ship’s crew boards the becalmed
  <em>Wisteria.</em> Use the <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#Ship">Ship map</a> in
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> appendix B.
  <em>Wisteria</em>’s crew ([monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters]) flees belowdecks or fights against
  other monsters while two waves of enemies (see below) fight the characters. Humanoids listed below
  are instead Undead. When destroyed, the creatures turn to brimstone and ash but eventually return
  (see “Hell’s Cove”).
</p>
<p>The pirates board in the following waves:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wave One.</strong> Eight [monsters]Pirate;Pirates[/monsters] board, led by a
  [monsters]Pirate Captain[/monsters] and a <strong>[monsters]Flameskull[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wave Two.</strong> As wave one falters, Lieutenant Mazterel
  ([monsters]Cambion[/monsters]), two [monsters]Bearded Devil;Bearded Devils[/monsters], and two
  [monsters]Pirate;Pirates[/monsters] join them. Facing defeat, Mazterel casts [spells]Plane
  Shift[/spells] to escape.
</p>
<p>
  Once the battle ends, <em>Bloodrider</em> breaks apart and sinks. The party has time to search the
  large quarters astern, where tattered logs and charts show <em>Bloodrider</em>’s port, a tiny cove
  a day’s sail away. If captured, Mazterel can give the same information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hell’s Cove.</em></strong> When the characters reach the cove, <em>Bloodrider</em> has
  returned. All Undead listed in waves one and two are back on the ship. They, and Mazterel if he
  escaped, ambush the party in the haunted village.
</p>
<p>
  The pirates’ treasure is hidden behind the waterfall and includes 3,500 GP, a set of amber dice
  worth 250 GP, a ship in a bottle decorated with gold and gemstones worth 750 GP,
  [magicitems]Mariner’s Armor[/magicitems] (Studded Leather Armor) and a [magicitems]Folding
  Boat[/magicitems].
</p>
<p>
  Within the captain’s grotto, the chain-bound, burning heart of <em>Bloodrider</em>’s former
  captain, Salton Vail, floats in the air. A [monsters]Chain Devil[/monsters] and two
  [monsters]Barbed Devil;Barbed Devils[/monsters] guard the heart. <em>Bloodrider</em> and its crew
  rise again 1 day after being destroyed unless the heart is doused in Holy Water and the
  [spells]Remove Curse[/spells] spell is cast on it. An [spells]Identify[/spells] spell cast on the
  heart reveals this ritual.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> With the permanent destruction of the <em>Bloodrider</em>,
  Shireen sings the group’s praises from Baldur’s Gate to Athkatla. Henceforth, she will provide a
  ship and crew for any journey the party wants to make.

<p><em>Move a volcano by using high magic.</em></p>
<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a high magic adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 8</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> High Moor geomancers predict that the volcano of Mount Hlim will erupt
  in a matter of days. The only way to save the nearby communities is to cast a powerful high magic
  spell that moves the mountain to a remote location.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Sizarak (Lawful Good [monsters]Lizardfolk Geomancer[/monsters]) teaches a
  powerful ritual to the characters. The geomancer asks the characters to collect the necessary
  component and perform the ritual to move Mount Hlim before it’s too late.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MovingMountainsEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The characters must overcome these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Adamantine Rod.</em></strong> To perform the high magic ritual, the characters must
  find a 3-foot-long adamantine rod made of ore extracted from beneath Mount Hlim. A wicked
  [monsters]Fire Giant[/monsters] dwelling inside the mountain has three such rods, each worth 1,000
  GP. The characters can sneak into the giant’s smithy (use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#VolcanicCaves">Volcanic Caves map</a> in appendix B of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>). There, they can confront
  the giant or try to steal a rod.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Place the Rod.</em></strong> The adamantine rod must be stuck in the earth where Mount
  Hlim will be teleported to. Each character makes a DC 20 Wisdom ([skill]Survival[/skill]) check.
  It takes the characters 1d6 days to find a suitable new location for the mountain, minus 1 for
  each character who succeeded on the check (minimum 1 day), during which rumblings and signs of an
  impending eruption increase.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conduct the Ritual.</em></strong> At least five participants must congregate in a
  circle around the adamantine rod and conduct the 8-hour ritual. At the end of the ritual, each
  participant must expend a level 3+ spell slot or take 22 (4d10) Psychic damage.
</p>
<p>
  Once the ritual is complete, the ground quakes violently as Mount Hlim emerges from the earth at
  its new location centered on the adamantine rod. Each creature touching the ground within 500 feet
  of the adamantine rod must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or have the
  [condition]Prone[/condition] condition. At the end of the ritual, the ritual’s participants are on
  the peak of Mount Hlim.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Survive the Volcano.</em></strong> Once the ritual is finished, a
  [monsters]Dao[/monsters] appears beside the characters and initiates combat. This is the spirit of
  the mountain. When the dao is defeated, it crumbles into dust, leaving behind a [magicitems]Ring
  of Three Wishes[/magicitems] with 1 charge remaining.
</p>
<p>
  Ten minutes after the dao is defeated, Mount Hlim erupts, spewing lava and ash in a 20-mile radius
  for 2d4 hours. For the duration, each creature within 1 mile of the mountain’s peak at the start
  of its turn takes 70 (20d6) Fire damage.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a high magic adventure for</p>

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A young human wizard named Povari Belendros (Medium, Chaotic Good
  [monsters]Mage[/monsters]) has devised a potential means of preserving some of summer’s warmth
  even in the heart of winter. She calls her spell the Summerlight Ceremony.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Povari hires the characters to procure a special reagent—bark from the
  luminous yew tree, harvested with a magical burning sickle—and to help her conduct her ceremony.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SummerlightEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The characters must complete these steps.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Obtain the Sickle.</em></strong> An [monsters]Azer Pyromancer[/monsters] named
  Caserrium living in the caves beneath Kelvin’s Cairn has crafted the burning sickle. He agrees to
  give it to the characters if they drive out a band of drow cultists lurking beneath the mountain.
  The drow include twelve [monsters]Drow of Lolth[/monsters] and two [monsters]Drow Elite Warrior of
  Lolth;Drow Elite Warriors of Lolth[/monsters] led by a [monsters]Drow Priestess of
  Lolth[/monsters]; see chapter 9 for all these stat blocks. Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#UnderdarkWarren">Underdark Warren map</a> from appendix B in
  the <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> for their lair. If the
  characters defeat or drive off the drow, Caserrium is good to his word and gives the party the
  sickle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Luminous Yew.</em></strong> The luminous yew is a massive, magical tree in an ominous
  copse in the Lonelywood. A greedy, Chaotic Evil [monsters]Treant[/monsters] guards the tree and
  fights the party on sight. Once the treant is destroyed, the party can collect the bark using the
  sickle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conducting the Ceremony.</em></strong> Back in Targos, Povari leads the characters in
  a ceremony around a giant bonfire. The taxing ritual takes 24 hours, at the end of which each
  character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 [condition]Exhaustion[/condition]
  level.
</p>
<p>
  Just as Povari is finishing the ceremony, a [monsters]Remorhaz[/monsters] bursts from the ground.
  Use the ground floor of the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#RoadsideInn">Roadside Inn map</a> from appendix B in the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. As long as the party defeats the creature, the ceremony is
  successful.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a faction (red wizards) adventure for</p>

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Red Wizards have discovered a lost vault dedicated to the demigod
  Velsharoon, patron of liches and others who seek undeath. The vault lies hidden beneath an ancient
  burial ground in Rashemi territory.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Honored Sage Varelles, a respected Red Wizard, offers the party the honor
  of plundering the vault on his behalf and bringing any arcane lore there back to him. He warns
  that others also seek the vault, so speed is of the essence.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="VaultEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>Use the map below. The vault’s main features and inhabitants are as follows.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>1: Entrance.</em></strong> A withered corpse, killed by a blast of necrotic energy
  from wards on the pillars, lies here. The wards are now spent, and the pillars nonmagical.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>2: Hall of the Blessed Dead.</em></strong> The massive statue of a lich fills the
  center of this room. Four withered bodies are scattered about. The statue is a
  <strong>[monsters]Haunting Revenant[/monsters].</strong> It killed rival explorers and tries to
  kill the party as well.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>3: Sarcophagi.</em></strong> Each sarcophagus holds a
  <strong>[monsters]Death Knight Aspirant[/monsters].</strong> If a sarcophagus is opened, the death
  knight begins combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>4: Fountain of Dark Knowledge.</em></strong> A fountain of unholy water churns in the
  room’s center. Narbossa, a [monsters]Marid[/monsters] drained of color and vitality by the
  necromantic energy of the vault, is bound to the fountain. Narbossa longs to return to the
  Elemental Plane of Water. It is [rules]Indifferent[/rules] to the characters, and the spell
  binding the marid to the fountain can be ended with the [spells]Dispel Magic[/spells] spell (DC
  14). If the party fails to end the binding, the marid initiates combat. A [magicitems]Necklace of
  Prayer Beads[/magicitems] lies submerged in the fountain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>5: Library.</em></strong> The library holds dozens of rare and ancient books on
  necromancy, as well as a [magicitems]Tome of Clear Thought[/magicitems]. A statue depicting
  Velsharoon is a [monsters]Stone Golem[/monsters] that fights if the books are touched.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>6: Puzzle Sphere.</em></strong> A sphere of complex, interlocking metal bands with an
  inky void at its core floats in this room. A character who takes a [action]Study[/action] action
  to inspect the sphere and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([skill]Arcana[/skill]) check deduces
  incantations required to make the sphere’s bands align, opening a portal to Mungoth, the third
  layer of Gehenna, where Velsharoon’s divine realm is found.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Varelles pays 5,000 GP for the books from the library,
  doubling his offer if the party brings him the [magicitems]Tome of Clear Thought[/magicitems]
  unused. Each character’s Renown Score with the Red Wizards increases by 1.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="DragonOrb">Dragon Orb</h3>

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a faction (cult of the dragon) adventure for</p>

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A Cult of the Dragon cell believes the [magicitems]Orb of
  Damara[/magicitems] lies in the trove of Cylrotanth, an [monsters]Adult Copper Dragon[/monsters]
  who dwells in the southern Serpent Hills.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Human Dragonfang Dain Romelin (Medium, Chaotic Evil [monsters]Cultist
  Fanatic[/monsters]) hires the characters to retrieve the orb from Cylrotanth’s lair and bring it
  to him in Soubar, northwest of Triel along the Trade Way near Boareskyr Bridge. Dain claims he has
  heard the dragon is huge and has reddish scales; he doesn’t admit Cylrotanth is a copper dragon.
  He offers the party 2,000 GP to complete this mission on the cult’s behalf, and he pays half up
  front.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DragonOrbEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Travel to the Lair.</em></strong> Cylrotanth’s lair lies 135 miles north of Soubar.
  Each day, use the appropriate encounter below:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 1.</strong> Wrathful riders (five [monsters]Flaming Skeleton;Flaming
  Skeletons[/monsters] riding [monsters]Nightmare;Nightmares[/monsters]) burst from the Fields of
  the Dead to reenact a fateful charge, targeting the characters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 2.</strong> Three [monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters] try to make a meal of the party.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 3.</strong> Two [monsters]Young Green Dragon;Young Green Dragons[/monsters] stalk the
  party through the Forest of Wyrms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 4.</strong> A [monsters]Grick Ancient[/monsters] ambushes the characters, and six
  [monsters]Grick;Gricks[/monsters] drop from trees to join in.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 5.</strong> Near Thlohtzin, a [monsters]Yuan-ti Abomination[/monsters] and four
  [monsters]Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1);Yuan-ti Malisons (Type 1)[/monsters] try to take the party
  prisoner.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Day 6.</strong> Cylrotanth’s friends—Kergan, a [monsters]Cyclops Oracle[/monsters], and
  Serteus, a [monsters]Cyclops Sentry[/monsters]—confront the characters with foreknowledge of their
  intent. They are [rules]Indifferent[/rules] but defend themselves if the characters fight them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cylrotanth’s Lair.</em></strong> Cylrotanth welcomes the group to his lair and asks if
  they’ve met his cyclops friends (see above). He becomes [rules]Hostile[/rules] if he learns the
  group harmed the giants, but he doesn’t fight. He’s willing to trade for his orb, which is a
  [magicitems]Crystal Ball[/magicitems] worth 40,000 GP.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cult Ambush.</em></strong> Assuming a fight with the dragon has weakened the group,
  Dain betrays the party in an attempt to take the orb for himself. He’s accompanied by four
  [monsters]Tough Boss;Tough Bosses[/monsters], and they ambush the characters outside Cylrotanth’s
  lair. If the characters befriended the dragon, Cylrotanth helps subdue these attackers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If parting on good terms, Cylrotanth considers the
  characters new friends. He rewards them for defeating Dain, giving them the <em>Crystal Ball</em>.
  If they traded him for it, he returns whatever they traded to him. If the party turns the orb over
  to the Cult of the Dragon, each character’s Renown Score with the Cult of the Dragon increases by
  1.

<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Meeting of the Minds.</em></strong> Kestra has arranged a meeting with syndicate
  leaders at dusk at a tavern called The Rotting Gull.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Boss Sneed</strong> (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Bandit Crime Lord[/monsters]) is the
  human leader of the Shaker Gang. He’s looking for an anniversary gift for his wife, an
  [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters] of Tymora. If the characters can provide a suitable gift, he will
  help them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Finchley</strong> (Small, Chaotic Evil [monsters]Tough Boss[/monsters]) is the halfling
  leader of the Dancers. He respects fighting ability and challenges one of the characters to
  non-deadly single combat. If the character wins and doesn’t kill Finchley, Finchley and his gang
  will help them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Walenna Eventide</strong> (Medium, Chaotic Neutral [monsters]Pirate Captain[/monsters]) is
  the wood elf leader of the Stallions. The <em>Sea Stallion</em> is in need of repairs. If the
  characters promise to make it seaworthy again, she will help them. Repairing the ship requires
  5,000 GP. Alternatively, characters can do the work in 100 days, divided by the number of
  characters working on the repairs.
</p>
<p>
  See “<a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-dalelands#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a>” in chapter 2 for
  more information on these individuals and their followers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Finding the Source.</em></strong> The source of the plague is a filthy warehouse in
  the harbor district. It takes 3d4 days of searching to find the warehouse. Reduce this by 1d4 for
  every gang the party recruits; if they recruit all three gangs, they find the warehouse before
  sunrise. Your players might come up with novel strategies to quickly find the source of the
  plague.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Warehouse.</em></strong> Use the map below for the warehouse, which contains
  Dyan’s alchemy lab. Characters searching the lab are exposed to the Shaking Plague (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-dalelands#ShakingPlague">chapter 2</a>). Four
  [monsters]Revenant;Revenants[/monsters], victims of Dyan’s alchemical testing, wander the
  warehouse and fight intruders. Within each of the southern labs lurks a [monsters]Violet Fungus
  Necrohulk[/monsters]. When either of the necrohulks is disturbed, it begins combat, waking the
  other, which bursts from the room it’s in.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Burning the warehouse to the ground eliminates the source of
  the plague, and the town slowly recovers. Each gang leader recruited by the party gives the
  characters an Uncommon magic item as thanks for saving the town.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a deity (bane) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 10</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A group of Banites called the Ashen Faithful have seized the
  gladiatorial arena in Hillsfar to conduct public trials, executing those they deem unworthy or
  corrupt. Many innocent people are caught in the crisis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Hillsfar’s senators summon the characters and ask them to infiltrate the
  arena and disrupt the upcoming execution of one of their own, Councilor Marellia.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AshenFaithfulEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>At the Senate.</em></strong> Senator Arnulf (Medium, Lawful Neutral
  [monsters]Noble[/monsters]), explains the Ashen Faithful plan to burn Councilor Marellia alive at
  sunset. The characters have 4 hours to prepare. Arnulf intends to stage a fake assault on the
  Banites surrounding the arena, drawing away defenders and creating a window for the characters to
  infiltrate the arena.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Infiltrate the Arena.</em></strong> The Ashen Faithful control the region around the
  arena. If the party is caught trying to infiltrate, they face a [monsters]Guard
  Captain[/monsters], three [monsters]Warrior Veteran;Warrior Veterans[/monsters], a
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters], and a rooftop <strong>[monsters]Assassin[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Disrupt the Execution.</em></strong> Ashen Faithful are preparing to burn Councilor
  Marellia and eight other prisoners (Medium [monsters]Noble;Nobles[/monsters]), at the stake. Use
  the arena map below. A human, Faenzel the Exalted Flame (Medium, Lawful Evil [monsters]Cultist
  Hierophant[/monsters]), exhorts followers in the stands from the northern skybox as two
  [monsters]Gladiator;Gladiators[/monsters] prepare prisoners in the middle of the arena. Three
  [monsters]Bearded Devil;Bearded Devils[/monsters] also stand guard in the arena. If the party
  defeats the enemies on the arena floor, Faenzel intervenes, joined by two more
  [monsters]Gladiator;Gladiators[/monsters] from beneath the arena.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Arena Dangers.</em></strong> The arena floor has six spiked pits (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#SpikedPit">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>), and the wall is studded
  with jagged iron spikes that prevent creatures from climbing out. Casks of lamp oil and wooden
  kindling are staged around the prisoners.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Escape with Councilor Marellia.</em></strong> Should the party flee with Marellia and
  other prisoners, cultists in another skybox complete a ritual summoning an [monsters]Ice
  Devil[/monsters] that chases them through the city.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If the characters successfully rescue Councilor Marellia,
  she rewards them with jeweled treasures worth a total of 3,000 GP.

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> The Silken Stewards, a sect of fanatical Lolth worshipers (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    >Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn), is kidnapping key figures from Neverwinter for ritual
    sacrifice as part of a broader campaign to destabilize the city.</a
  >
</p>
<a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/">
  <p>
    <strong>Hook.</strong> The Lord Protector summons the characters to stop the disappearances
    before a panic sets in, promising 8,000 GP for their assistance.
  </p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SilkandSufferingEncounters">Encounters</h4>
  <p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
</a>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong><em>The Spider’s Path.</em></strong> The drow are using tunnels that lead up under
    Neverwinter’s cemetery. As the party follows this route into the Underdark, they navigate a
    labyrinth of caverns crisscrossed with thick webs. The priests took pains to train a </a
  >[monsters]Roper[/monsters] that hides among the webs. Packs of 2d6 + 1 [monsters]Phase
  Spider;Phase Spiders[/monsters] are also drawn to motion on the webs. Eventually, the characters
  reach the Fane of Fecundity; use the map below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Chapel.</em></strong> This cold, beautiful room is decorated with iconography sacred
  to Lolth, two intricately carved statues, and luxurious tapestries. Entering the northern part of
  the room without praying the correct prayer of obeisance causes two
  [monsters]Yochlol;Yochlols[/monsters] to burst from the two statues and begin combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Vestry.</em></strong> Two [monsters]Drow Priestess of Lolth;Drow Priestesses of
  Lolth[/monsters] meditate in this room and become [rules]Hostile[/rules] if disturbed. A
  [magicitems]Cloak of Arachnida[/magicitems] hangs in a locked armoire.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ritual Chamber.</em></strong> Three [monsters]Drider;Driders[/monsters] use this room
  for magic rituals, occasionally visiting the nursery and spider den.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Trapped Hall.</em></strong> A lurid painting of Lolth in the Demonweb Pits hangs here.
  Passing by the painting without offering the appropriate prayer to Lolth causes the painting to
  cast the [spells]Disintegrate[/spells] spell (DC 15) targeting the closest creature. Open jars
  containing the ashes of prior victims and arranged before the painting hint at the trap.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nursery.</em></strong> Webs fill this cave, and pulsing, wet egg sacs hanging to the
  north. Touching the webs alerts two [monsters]Drider;Driders[/monsters] who crawl up from the
  ritual chamber (below) and investigate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Birthing Chamber.</em></strong> This domed cavern sports a massive statue of Lolth in
  her spider form. Arrayed before the statue like the legs of a spider are eight nurturing cages,
  occupied by Neverwinter citizens kept as food for spiderlings who crawl all over them. Hashtuth, a
  drow [monsters]Vampire[/monsters] and priest of Lolth, monitors the victims as the spiders feed.
  She is assisted by two [monsters]Helmed Horror;Helmed Horrors[/monsters], each adorned with eight
  glowing ruby eyes. The captives are still alive and can be rescued.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spider Den.</em></strong> 3d6 [monsters]Giant Spider;Giant Spiders[/monsters] lair
  here. They threaten the characters but flee and hide if attacked.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheFlyingFortress">The Flying Fortress</h3>

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a faction (purple dragon knights) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 11</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Cultists of the Dragon have taken control of a cloud giant’s flying
  castle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Cormyr’s queen asks the characters to lead the attack on this flying menace
  and offers [monsters]Wyvern[/monsters] mounts to those who need one.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="FlyingFortressEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>Most of this adventure takes place in the sky.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Flying toward Doom.</em></strong> The flying fortress’s trail of carnage is easy to
  track. As the characters approach, a patrol of four cult [monsters]Gladiator;Gladiators[/monsters]
  riding [monsters]Wyvern;Wyverns[/monsters] intercepts them. One of the gladiators carries a map
  showing the fortress with a red heart-shaped symbol inside the central hill.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Veil of Storms.</em></strong> The fortress is protected by an arcane storm. When they
  approach the fortress, characters and mounts make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10)
  Bludgeoning damage and 21 (6d6) Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
  successful one.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fight in the Air.</em></strong> Use the Flying Fortress map below. Four
  [monsters]Young Black Dragon;Young Black Dragons[/monsters] protect the fortress by air. The
  fortress includes the following features:
</p>
<p><strong>Caves.</strong> Two caves provide entry to the fortress’s heart (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Gatehouses.</strong> A Huge iron portcullis blocks entry and exit of each gatehouse.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Keep.</strong> The fortress is steered by an evil [monsters]Archmage[/monsters] in the
  keep. The keep’s walls are patrolled by five <strong>Half-Dragons.</strong> If the archmage is
  defeated, the fortress slows and descends, reaching the ground safely in 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong>Maze.</strong> A cluster of buildings provides an obstacle course for flying
    characters. Use the chase rules in </a
  ><a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Chases">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> to adjudicate characters in
  the maze.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Towers.</strong> Cult archers crowd each tower. When an enemy of the cult moves within 40
  feet of a tower for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13
  Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) Piercing damage. A creature makes this save only once per
  turn. If a character lands on or attacks a tower, archers there abandon their post.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tunnel.</strong> The enclosed tunnel can be entered only through gatehouses at either end.
  It makes an excellent place for melee combat with flying foes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Heart.</em></strong> Characters passing through the caves enter a vast, dark
  cavern housing the magical beating heart of the fortress. The heart (AC 13, HP 5) is protected by
  a <strong>Shadow Dragon</strong> named Gloamstalker. If the heart is destroyed, the castle
  plummets from the sky, crashing in 1 minute.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> When the archmage is defeated or the heart destroyed, the
  surviving cultists flee. The queen gives the characters land and noble titles in a grand ceremony.
  Each character’s Renown Score with the Purple Dragon Knights increases by 1.

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheFoehammerHorn">The Foehammer Horn</h3>
<p><em>Recover a relic sacred to the storm god.</em></p>
<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a deity (tempus) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 11</p>
  <p>characters</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> The <em>Foehammer Horn</em>, a relic of Tempus, has surfaced in a tomb
  in the Fields of the Dead. Tempus has sent visions of the relic to various individuals, prompting
  them to race to the site and compete to claim the horn.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> A character who reveres Tempus dreams of taking up the
  <em>Foehammer Horn</em>, waking with clear knowledge of the relic’s location.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="FoehammerEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>
  Use the <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#BarrowCrypt">Barrow Crypt map</a> in appendix B of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>. On level 1, remove the
  leftmost stairway leading down. Level 2 consists only of the rightmost stairs, the chamber
  directly north of these stairs, and the connecting corridor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Battle Circle.</em></strong> Standing stones encircling the barrow bear pictograms of
  battle and of Tempus. Within the circle sprawl the corpses of slain warriors. Various survivors,
  devotees of Tempus, have just discovered the secret entrance to the tomb. All these individuals
  are Chaotic Neutral and Medium. They include Ysold, a human ([monsters]Warrior
  Commander[/monsters]); Hisnix, a dwarf ([monsters]Berserker Commander[/monsters]); and Elegnos, an
  elf knight (use the [monsters]Githyanki Knight[/monsters] stat block, but change the creature type
  to Humanoid). They are allied and fight interlopers. If not dealt with here, these foes eventually
  follow the party into the tomb. Ysold has already found the secret door among the stones, and it
  lies open.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> Complex locks (1 minute to pick) of Superior quality (DC 20) seal
  all doors in the tomb. Forcing open a door requires a successful DC 20 Strength
  ([skill]Athletics[/skill]) check as an action.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Side Entrance.</em></strong> Long ago, tomb raiders carved two holes in the barrow’s
  western side. The raiders’ remains can still be seen. They were slain by two [monsters]Stone
  Golem;Stone Golems[/monsters] that resemble Tempus and guard this entrance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Trooper Hall.</em></strong> The walls of the chamber surrounded by seven tombs depict
  assembled troops, each soldier with a unique face. The [spells]Glyph of Warding[/spells] spell has
  been cast on the south and west entrances to this chamber. A rune is triggered if a creature moves
  through that entrance. Both glyphs use the Explosive Rune option, one dealing Lightning damage and
  the other Thunder. After a rune is triggered, seven [monsters]Helmed Horror;Helmed
  Horrors[/monsters] plastered into the walls burst free and ambush intruders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Clangor Halls.</em></strong> Wall carvings depict the fury of war in the two eastern
  chambers and stairs down to level 2. When trespassers enter, a war horn sounds, red light
  illuminates the area, sounds of warfare erupt, and thirteen guardian spirits manifest from burial
  niches. Four of these spirits have the stat block of a [monsters]Gladiator[/monsters], and nine
  have the stat block of a [monsters]Berserker[/monsters], but all are Celestials instead of
  Humanoids.
</p>
<p>
  When the spirits begin combat, each character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or enter
  a battle fury. Characters in a battle fury have Advantage on attack rolls using Strength, but
  attack rolls against them have Advantage, and the character can’t take the
  [action]Disengage[/action] or [action]Dodge[/action] actions. At the end of their turn, characters
  in a battle fury repeat the saving throw, ending the fury on a success. When the last spirit is
  defeated, any battle fury affecting a character ends.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Pillared Hall.</em></strong> Double doors seal this hall on the east and west. Within,
  wall carvings portray warriors in celebration. A simple altar to Tempus occupies a long southern
  niche, while narrower alcoves hold old crates and barrels of military rations long turned to dust.
  A character who prays to Tempus at the altar can use it to cast [spells]Heroes’ Feast[/spells]
  without spell components. Once used in this way, the altar becomes nonmagical.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Foehammer Hall.</em></strong> Stairs descend to a single hall with two supporting
  columns. Niches line the walls, which depict Tempus battling various foes. Shelves in the niches
  hold broken implements of war. When all the characters have entered, a horn sounds, the northern
  wall cracks, and an avatar of Tempus charges from it. Use the [monsters]Questing Knight[/monsters]
  stat block for the avatar, changing creature type to Celestial and any Radiant damage to Fire
  damage. When the avatar drops to 0 Hit Points, it rises again as a [monsters]Berserker
  Commander[/monsters] (change its creature type to Celestial) with all its Hit Points and continues
  to fight. If defeated again, it is destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> With the avatar’s defeat, the crack in the northern wall
  crumbles, revealing the <em>Foehammer Horn:</em> a bronze [magicitems]Horn of
  Valhalla[/magicitems].

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Sewer Plague (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#SewerPlague">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>) has broken out in Soubar,
  near Baldur’s Gate. Powerful magic is necessary to counteract the magical contagion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Soubar’s mayor hires the characters to assist the elf Stormshade (Medium
  [monsters]Druid[/monsters]), who has devised a cure for the contagion.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BlightonSoubarEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>Characters must resolve these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Collect Night Holly.</em></strong> To perform the cleansing rites, Stormshade needs
  the consecrated ashes of a branch of night holly. Night holly grows in a thicket in the Fields of
  the Dead; it resembles mundane holly, but under bright moonlight, its leaves glitter like stars in
  the night sky. Eight [monsters]Vampire Spawn[/monsters] roam the thicket and prey on the party.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, on the night the characters arrive at the thicket, the moon is obscured by clouds.
  The [spells]Moonbeam[/spells] and [spells]Font of Moonlight[/spells] spells can be used to bring
  moonlight to the overcast thicket. Otherwise, a character can identify night holly by taking a
  [action]Study[/action] action and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ([skill]Nature[/skill])
  check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Burn the Holly in Sacred Fire.</em></strong> Once cut, the night holly must be burned
  in a sacred brazier at a nearby abandoned temple before dawn. The holly takes 1 hour to burn into
  white ash, but an [monsters]Adult Black Dragon[/monsters] now lairs in the temple. Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#DragonsLair">Dragon’s Lair map</a> from appendix B in the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for the temple; the brazier is on level 3.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Perform the Rites.</em></strong> To complete the cleansing rites, the holly ashes must
  be sprinkled in a well in Soubar. Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#Farmstead">Farmstead map</a> from appendix B of the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as the ashes are dispersed, at least three creatures must recite magical words in Druidic
  around the well for 1 minute; this requires the creatures to maintain [rules]Concentration[/rules]
  for the duration. Stormshade and four villagers ([monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters]) join the
  characters in reciting the words.
</p>
<p>
  When the ritual begins, six [monsters]Vrock;Vrocks[/monsters] emerge from the well and begin
  combat. As long as at least three participants maintain Concentration for the ritual’s full
  duration, the ritual is a success and the Sewer Plague is stopped.

  <strong>Situation.</strong> Miners have unearthed the ruins of Myth Rodarnum, an ancient elven
  settlement deep under the village of Snowmantle in Daggerdale (or another settlement of your
  choice). Among the ruins is a circle of power connected to a now-dormant mythal. If reactivated,
  the mythal could protect the village with powerful magic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> A [monsters]Guardian Naga[/monsters] named Lendroscalipos finds the
  characters and asks them to uncover the secrets of the mythal in Myth Rodarnum’s ruins.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MysteryEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>Characters must resolve these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Commune with the Mythal.</em></strong> A creature can commune with the circle of power
  as a [action]Magic[/action] action. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
  take 16 (3d10) Psychic damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Face the Ghouls.</em></strong> When communed with, the circle of power thrums loudly,
  attracting three [monsters]Dire Worg;Dire Worgs[/monsters] who immediately fight the characters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Solve the Mythal’s Riddle.</em></strong> A creature that communes with the mythal
  hears the following riddle in a whispered voice:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Themightofthemythaldrawsfrommagicitemsfour">
  <p><em>The might of the mythal draws from magic items four:</em></p>
  <p><em>The first from the waters, the second can pour,</em></p>
  <p><em>The third carries others, the fourth, someone wore.</em></p>
  <p><em>Offer these relics and let light shine on the ring,</em></p>
  <p><em>Then hide from the glory. Forth from the circle spring.</em></p>
</aside>
<p>
  <strong><em>Offer Magic Items.</em></strong> When four suitable Uncommon or rarer magic items are
  placed in the circle of power, the circle glows dimly. What items meet the riddle’s criteria,
  exactly, is up to you. For example, these items could work: a [magicitems]Trident of Fish
  Command[/magicitems], a [magicitems]Decanter of Endless Water[/magicitems], a [magicitems]Bag of
  Holding[/magicitems], and a suit of [magicitems]Adamantine Armor[/magicitems].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Illuminate the Circle.</em></strong
  >“Let light shine on the ring” hints that the circle of power must be exposed to sunlight, such as
  that from the [spells]Daylight[/spells] spell.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Find Cover.</em></strong> Once the riddle has been solved, the thrumming reaches a
  deafening volume. After 1 minute, a 50-foot-wide, 500-foot-high [rules]Cylinder[/rules] of light
  erupts from the circle of power. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving
  throw, taking 35 (10d6) Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
  one.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Mythal.</em></strong> The effects of the reawakened mythal are up to you to
  determine.

  <strong><em>Kissethkashaan’s Lair.</em></strong> Kissethkashaan ([monsters]Adult White
  Dragon[/monsters]) lives atop a tall mountain peak shrouded in perpetual snow. He is attended by
  four white [monsters]Half-Dragon;Half-Dragons[/monsters] and seeks to avoid conflict but defends
  his lair if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cyric Cultists.</em></strong> The cultists move from one monolith to the next,
  damaging each to release Fiends trapped within. A [monsters]Cultist Hierophant[/monsters] leads
  two [monsters]Fiend Cultist;Fiend Cultists[/monsters] and eight [monsters]Gnoll Fang of
  Yeenoghu;Gnoll Fangs of Yeenoghu[monsters]. They fight anyone who threatens their mission.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Monoliths.</em></strong> When the party reaches their first monolith, they find it
  destroyed and four [monsters]Vrock;Vrocks[/monsters] dancing amid the rubble. At the second
  monolith, a cult [monsters]Mage[/monsters] and her two [monsters]Assassin[/monsters] bodyguards
  survey the stone for the cult, but it isn’t yet damaged. If the party hasn’t encountered the Cyric
  Cultists previously, they find the cultists at the third monolith performing a ritual around the
  stone while the gnolls keep guard. The ritual takes 10 minutes to complete. If the cultists aren’t
  interrupted, the monolith shatters and a [monsters]Goristro[/monsters] bursts forth.

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> A massive, walking necropolis called the Bone Titan has emerged from
  the Trollmoors. Created by an enterprising [monsters]Archmage[/monsters] named Kryzzik the
  Profane, this gargantuan titan of crypt stone, bone, and corpses marches inexorably toward the
  town of Triboar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The Knights of the Eternal Order (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    >Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn) call on the party to infiltrate the Bone Titan and destroy
    whatever controls it while the knights attempt to slow it down. The knights pledge a reward of
    25,000 GP for the party’s help.</a

</p>
<a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/">
  <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DreadMarchEncounters">Encounters</h4>
  <p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>March of Desolation.</em></strong> Characters approaching the Bone Titan see ruined
    villages, dead forests, and cursed land empty of living creatures.
  </p>
</a>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong><em>Climb the Colossus.</em></strong> Use the Bone Titan map below for this and
    subsequent encounters. The party must find a way into the Bone Titan. The interior is warded
    against teleportation, but entry points at the hips or arms can be reached by flight or by
    climbing. Eight </a
  >[monsters]Vampire Spawn[/monsters] crawl around the titan’s exterior, defending it from
  intruders. The necromantic magic of the Bone Titan protects the vampires, preventing them from
  being affected by sunlight.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hips.</em></strong> Six [monsters]Flesh Golem;Flesh Golems[/monsters] guard barrels of
  combustible necrotic fuel stored in the hips. Each barrel has AC 15, HP 25, and Vulnerability to
  Fire damage. Destroying all the barrels halts the Bone Titan after 1d10 minutes but doesn’t
  destroy it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Torso.</em></strong> Six rope-and-pulley systems of muscle, tendon, and bone (each AC
  11, HP 27) supply power to the titan. Destroying them leaves the titan unable to walk or lift its
  arms. The torso is defended by three
  <strong>[monsters]Death Knight Aspirant;Death Knight Aspirants[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Arms.</em></strong> The titan’s arms boast cannons firing warheads of necrotic energy.
  Each cannon is operated by five
  <strong>[monsters]Death Cultist;Death Cultists[/monsters].</strong> Characters who have
  proficiency in the [skill]Arcana[/skill] or [skill]Religion[/skill] skill can detonate a warhead.
  Detonating one warhead causes a chain reaction with other warheads, obliterating the arm the
  warhead is housed in; creatures in the arm when the warhead explodes makes a DC 15 Dexterity
  saving throw, taking 12d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Head.</em></strong> Kryzzik steers the Bone Titan from a throne in the head. If the
  characters stop the titan’s progress, he flees.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Once the Bone Titan’s march is stopped and Kryzzik abandons
  it, its necromantic aura fades and nature takes over. Within months, the skeletal frame of the
  titan becomes home to birds and other animals, and locals plunder it for building stone.

<div class="level-flag">
  <p>a deity (torm) adventure for</p>
  <p>Level 13</p>

</div>
<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> <em>Chalsembyr’s Heart</em>, a sentient [magicitems]Holy Avenger
  Greatsword[/magicitems] sacred to Torm, has been located in the hoard of Khrangyrdis, an
  [monsters]Adult Red Dragon[/monsters] and worshiper of Tiamat. Khran, as the dragon is often
  called, lairs near Ormpur. Complicating matters, Khran wears an [magicitems]Amulet of Proof
  against Detection and Location[/magicitems]. Her lair is protected by a
  [spells]Forbiddance[/spells] spell that damages Celestials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Zimrir Chay (Medium [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]), a human devoted to
  Torm, asks the characters to acquire the sword from Khran. While the party could negotiate, he
  prefers that the dragon be destroyed, freeing the region from her sway. If the characters agree to
  slay the creature, Zimrir provides each character with a [magicitems]Potion of
  Healing[/magicitems] (supreme) and a [magicitems]Potion of Fire Resistance[/magicitems].
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HeartofFireEncounters">Encounters</h4>
<p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Saffron Slayers.</em></strong> The people of Ormpur know the location of Khran’s lair,
  east across the Shaar in the Dun Hills. But the dragon has countless well-paid eyes and ears in
  the city, so the party’s fame and purpose quickly spread. Elite forces of a gang in Khran’s
  employ—a [monsters]Bandit Crime Lord[/monsters], a [monsters]Spy Master[/monsters], and two
  [monsters]Assassin;Assassins[/monsters]—ambush the characters and urge them to leave Ormpur for
  good.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/"
    ><strong><em>Burning Shaar.</em></strong> More of Khran’s allies hear of the party and their
    quest, pursuing them into the Shaar and then the Dun Hills as the characters approach the lair.
    The elf Naedrin (Medium </a
  >[monsters]Cultist Hierophant[/monsters]) flies in on the back of Aphusso, a
  <strong>[monsters]Young Red Dragon[/monsters].</strong> Naedrin talks first, using his magic to
  turn would-be dragonslayers from their path. Failing that, Naedrin calls forth two [monsters]Fire
  Elemental;Fire Elementals[/monsters] and initiates combat. If the battle takes place in the Shaar,
  an inferno (see <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Inferno">chapter 3</a> of the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>) results.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ash Lands.</em></strong> Khran greets the party from a hilltop the party must pass. If
  battle ensues, she leaves as soon as she can, with a parting invitation to join her later for a
  fine meal.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Khrangyrdis’s Lair.</em></strong> Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#DragonsLair">Dragon Lair map</a> in appendix B of the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. This structure is an old temple to Tiamat, destroyed during the
  Spellplague. Khran prefers level 3, but she doesn’t want her servants slain and fights intruders
  when she becomes aware of them. Khran’s lair is further detailed below:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Level 1.</strong> Bizarre yet elegant formations of sharp, melted stone make up the
  scorched ruins that top Khran’s hill. An unscathed shrine to Tiamat remains in the northeastern
  corner, outside two stone doors, each with a [monsters]Salamander[/monsters] guard. These guards
  allow visitors to enter the site. Beyond the doors, a [monsters]Salamander Inferno
  Master[/monsters] tends an ancient pool of molten stone for Khran’s enjoyment. Once the party is
  inside, the master and guards ambush them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Level 2.</strong> Walls and pillars carved with images extolling the glory of the Dragon
  Queen make up this firelit level. Four red [monsters]Half-Dragon;Half-Dragons[/monsters] live and
  work here, guided by a <strong>[monsters]Fiend Cultist[/monsters].</strong> These loyal minions
  fight intruders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Level 3.</strong> Khran dwells and stores her hoard, including
  <em>Chalsembyr’s Heart</em>, here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Tormtars celebrate characters who return
  <em>Chalsembyr’s Heart</em> to the House of the Hand. Priests offer the sword to a character who
  serves Torm and is willing to search for the lost realm of Chalsembyr, which Torm ruled as a
  mortal.
