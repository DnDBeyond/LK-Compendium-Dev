  Adventure Summary
</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="321de1ed-b677-4f8d-b20b-fed678e2fae2">
  The characters are contacted by Myrna Nor, a student of magic and wealthy heir. Myrna and her
  former colleague, Powell “the Owl” Niccam, have deduced the location of a hidden library built
  centuries ago by Lethchauntos, an infamous wizard.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea9094dd-a757-48fd-a029-b88fc663b7a0">
  But Myrna and Powell have had a falling out. The library is believed to contain the
  <a href="#TheNathlum" data-content-chunk-id="5c0d57df-44ab-413c-90e2-896cb9449472">Nathlum</a>, a
  legendary book detailing deadly poisons and powerful spells. Powell wants to recover the
  <em>Nathlum</em> and sell it to the Zhentarim for a fortune. Myrna wants to preserve the
  <em>Nathlum</em> and restore Lethchauntos’s unjustly tarnished legacy.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f051dead-2da7-4bd8-9d94-5702433fdeb4">
  Myrna hires the characters to find the <em>Nathlum</em> before Powell does. The party travels to
  the library to find Powell already there. They must overcome her guards and navigate the library’s
  dangers. Eventually the characters confront Powell to recover the <em>Nathlum.</em>
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00c6458d-0180-4896-a582-3052bd60abc3">
  The adventure takes two or three sessions. When the characters return to Myrna, hopefully with the
  <em>Nathlum</em>, they should be level 3.

  located five hidden libraries he constructed.

  Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e83e959-db79-4148-a02a-95090f41cf56">
  Five centuries ago, an orc priest named Wund forged a kingdom under the Sword Mountains, choosing
  an orc warlord named Uruth as a figurehead ruler. Wund was devoted to an evil god of death and
  disease, and Uruth was a cruel warmonger. A young orc wizard named Nath fled the Sword Mountains
  with his wife Ona and their children to avoid the wars he knew Wund and Uruth would soon wage.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eaf3f4e5-48e6-4346-be63-4bb229d90681">
  Settling near the village of Phandalin south of Neverwinter, Nath traded with farming families and
  shared arcane knowledge with the crafters of nearby Wave Echo Cave. Nath hid his identity to
  protect himself and his family, and the folk of Phandalin knew him as Lethchauntos.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa477016-8c6c-4c17-9584-4ee996e38044">
  Nath and his family had peace for a few years but, deeply troubled by Wund’s leadership,
  Lethchauntos decided to take action. With the skilled crafters of Wave Echo Cave, he forged the
  <em>Ettin Axe</em>, a sentient weapon with two distinct minds and personalities. Then, leaving his
  family, he returned to the Sword Mountains and sought out Uruth. Nath argued that Wund was selfish
  and manipulative, and Uruth had an obligation to be a wiser, better king. He gave Uruth the
  <em>Ettin Axe</em>, optimistically hoping that the axe’s two minds would balance out the bad
  advice Uruth was getting from Wend.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a8a2f9b6-29f3-4c24-8936-ee4f881773f4">
  For a brief time, Wund, Nath, Uruth, and the twin minds of the <em>Ettin Axe</em> were locked in a
  power struggle for Uruth’s realm. But communications from Nath’s family ceased and, fearing the
  worst, the wizard fled home to find his family dead from poisons only Wund knew how to brew.
  Wund’s spies had identified Nath’s family and murdered them.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="011ba453-576c-444c-a736-e140c7d7e66b">
  Nath was devastated. Donning black robes of mourning, he forsook his birth name. For the rest of
  his life, he wore only black and answered only to Lethchauntos. For twenty years, he researched
  Wund’s poisons in an attempt to find antidotes to the poisons that killed his family, collecting
  this knowledge in a book he dubbed the
  <a href="#TheNathlum" data-content-chunk-id="687a98f3-9ece-4204-9ca4-a2f946f3416c">Nathlum</a>,
  and planned elaborate memorials for his loved ones.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22641d54-d78b-4828-bbbd-be1bf0209ff2">
  Uruth and Wund eventually perished in war, but one of Uruth’s successors discovered Lethchauntos’s
  location and led a raid against Phandalin, devastating the region.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="92d198b5-7349-4762-bdaa-edeaebd6e9cc">
  Lethchauntos survived, but he considered himself cursed for bringing death to his friends and
  family. He left Phandalin and put his final plans in motion, visiting the Dalelands, Icewind Dale,
  Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate, places his family had spoken of visiting. In
  each of these locations, he constructed a hidden library, burying one of his family in each
  location. When the last library was complete, Lethchauntos departed for the Outer Planes. His
  final fate is unknown.

  A Tale of Two Apprentices
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51582e5a-0efd-42be-bef5-d2743ccda165">
  Today Lethchauntos is mostly forgotten, and those who do recall him believe he was an evil wizard
  due to his association with poison and slaughter. But two students of magic named Myrna Nor and
  Powell Niccam discovered the existence of the <em>Nathlum</em> from old records found in Phandalin
  and Wave Echo Cave. The two didn’t agree on what to do next, though. While Myrna wanted to recover
  the <em>Nathlum</em> for academic purposes, Powell saw an opportunity to get rich quick.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff24c13f-3db1-4e20-96f2-6cbe4558be96">
  Powell reached out to Zhentarim agents and told them about the <em>Nathlum</em>, which details
  many deadly poisons. She offered to share the knowledge with the Zhentarim in exchange for the
  agents’ help in recovering the <em>Nathlum.</em> With Zhentarim allies and goblin and hobgoblin
  mercenaries she hired along the way, Powell set out for the hidden library near Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d9d982d-c424-4780-befb-80290b668cde">
  Myrna wants to stop Powell, but she’s no adventurer. She uses her merchant contacts to locate the
  characters, and she hires them to stop Powell and recover the <em>Nathlum.</em>

    You meet at the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale. Your host is Myrna Nor, the heir to a wealthy

    terrible problem, and I’m hoping you can solve it.
  </p>
  <p>
    “My colleague Powell Niccam and I learned of a hidden library built by a long-dead orc wizard
    named Lethchauntos. He wrote the <em>Nathlum</em>, a book of arcane lore that we believe is
    located in this hidden library. But Powell has offered to sell the tome’s secrets to the
    Zhentarim!
  </p>
  <p>
    “The <em>Nathlum</em> details how to create many rare poisons, as well as their cures. Who knows
    what the Zhentarim would do with such knowledge? No, the <em>Nathlum</em>—and the rest of the
    library—must be recovered for the good of Faerûn.”

<p data-content-chunk-id="cb65f2db-63c1-4fc9-ad85-fa496a90fbab">
  Myrna offers the characters 100 GP each to travel to the library and recover the
  <em>Nathlum.</em> She can answer questions about Lethchauntos, Powell, and the
  <em>Nathlum.</em> She can tell the characters the information in “<a

  Lethchauntos wasn’t an evil wizard but a tragic and well-meaning figure, if sometimes misguided.

  Myrna provides the location of the library’s entrance in Cormanthor, beneath a hill between the
  Standing Stone and Myth Drannor. She tells the characters Lethchauntos built five hidden

  at this one.

        A door stands ajar in the north wall of this room, and a hole has been dug in the east wall.
        A goblin stands on watch, while other goblins talk and rest nearby. An open cage fills the

      dangerous trap, and the glass sphere imprisons a creature; see below for more on both. The
      words written above the entrances are in the Orc language and read, “The wolf does not bite
      the hand that feeds it.” This is a clue to avoiding or disarming the trap.

      <strong><em>Trap.</em></strong> The wolf statue is a magical trap. If a creature touches the
      table or anything on it—including the glass sphere—without first disarming the trap, the
      statue fills the room with toxic gas. Each creature in the room when the trap activates makes
      a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) Poison damage on a failed save or half as
      much damage on a successful one. The trap resets after 1 minute.

      <strong><em>Glass Sphere.</em></strong> The glass sphere is an enchanted prison for Regret—a
      Celestial, Neutral Good <strong>Empyrean Iota</strong> embodying a faded memory of Mystra, a
      deity of magic. Lethchauntos imprisoned the iota in the sphere long ago and accidentally
      abandoned it when he left. The sphere has 1 Hit Point and breaks if dropped or thrown at the
      ground. If the sphere breaks, Regret is freed.

      If a character approaches the sphere, it pulses faintly with silver light. A character

      Regret can communicate mentally with anyone touching the sphere. It pleads with the characters
      to break the sphere and free it, promising to use its powers on their behalf, but it refuses
      to carry out evil actions. If Regret is freed, it makes good on its promise, assisting the
      characters with any encounters on this level of the library, including area 8. Regret won’t go
      further into the library, and after assisting the characters for up to 1 day, it flees the

  damage from the fall. A creature that lands in the webs or starts its turn there must succeed on a
  DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or have the [condition]Restrained[/condition] condition until the web
  in that creature’s space is destroyed. Each 5-foot square of web has AC 10, HP 5, Vulnerability to
  Fire damage, and Immunity to Psychic and Poison damage.

  <strong><em>Spiders.</em></strong> This chasm is a home to two [monsters]Giant Spider;Giant
  Spiders[/monsters] and two swarms of spiders ([monsters]Swarm of Insects;Swarms of

  swarms hide at the south end of the chasm. The spiders ambush any creature that falls into the web
  or reaches the south end of the chasm.

  <strong><em>Platforms.</em></strong> Three platforms used to bridge this chasm, but the middle
  platform collapsed long ago, leaving a treacherous space between the remaining two platforms. A
  creature that tries to leap between the platforms makes a DC 12 Dexterity

  Myrna, she is overjoyed by their success and rewards each character with the promised 100 GP,
  asking them to relate everything they’ve discovered. She is especially glad if they have
  Lethchauntos’s journal, which supports Myrna’s theories about the wizard’s life. For completing
  their quest, each character gains 100 XP. The characters should now be level 3.

  If the party was successful, Myrna points out that Lethchauntos built four more libraries in
  different parts of Faerûn. Each awaits discovery, and who knows what mysteries they contain? You
  can design these libraries yourself, using the library described in this chapter as inspiration.

      The library itself, however, is in the Feywild. Anyone who passes through the door finds
