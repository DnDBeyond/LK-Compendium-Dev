<p data-content-chunk-id="cb45d27a-c8e3-42b4-9aaf-60432bcecf10">The characters are contacted by Myrna Nor, a student of magic and wealthy heir. Myrna and her former colleague, Powell “the Owl” Niccam, have deduced the location of a hidden library built centuries ago by Lethchauntos, an infamous wizard.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1898fca6-3b8a-4dfa-8f05-2bc449043314">But Myrna and Powell have had a falling out. The library is believed to contain the <a href="#TheNathlum" data-content-chunk-id="7eca1ea8-4802-4646-9f27-1409eccbdeb8">Nathlum</a> , a legendary book detailing deadly poisons and powerful spells. Powell wants to recover the <em>Nathlum</em> and sell it to the Zhentarim for a fortune. Myrna wants to preserve the <em>Nathlum</em> and restore Lethchauntos’s unjustly tarnished legacy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="050dcae0-07a9-407e-b077-c149ecdeba15">Myrna hires the characters to find the <em>Nathlum</em> before Powell does. The party travels to the library to find Powell already there. They must overcome her guards and navigate the library’s dangers. Eventually the characters confront Powell to recover the <em>Nathlum.</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a36c1caf-7d05-45f5-b19c-87b4c73363dc">The adventure takes two or three sessions. When the characters return to Myrna, hopefully with the <em>Nathlum</em> , they should be level 3.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="71d01b0b-d42d-479a-aa36-ae2328f218cf">The story of this adventure involves an infamous wizard named Lethchauntos whose work and legacy have been long misunderstood. Recently two students of magic discovered the truth about him and located five hidden libraries he constructed.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LethchauntossTragicLife" data-content-chunk-id="8a4ee9d8-f6cc-482d-b8a4-0fda46649e62"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#LethchauntossTragicLife" data-content-chunk-id="4639c18c-235f-4ddb-a998-a501bba427d1"> </a> Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a613aa8f-434f-4147-ab59-b9cc1cbc6221">Five centuries ago, an orc priest named Wund forged a kingdom under the Sword Mountains, choosing an orc warlord named Uruth as a figurehead ruler. Wund was devoted to an evil god of death and disease, and Uruth was a cruel warmonger. A young orc wizard named Nath fled the Sword Mountains with his wife Ona and their children to avoid the wars he knew Wund and Uruth would soon wage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="24469314-323f-4f38-a43d-10ac4455dbc4">Settling near the village of Phandalin south of Neverwinter, Nath traded with farming families and shared arcane knowledge with the crafters of nearby Wave Echo Cave. Nath hid his identity to protect himself and his family, and the folk of Phandalin knew him as Lethchauntos.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff757c85-8ac8-4cbb-9fa5-18e3c1447306">Nath and his family had peace for a few years but, deeply troubled by Wund’s leadership, Lethchauntos decided to take action. With the skilled crafters of Wave Echo Cave, he forged the <em>Ettin Axe</em> , a sentient weapon with two distinct minds and personalities. Then, leaving his family, he returned to the Sword Mountains and sought out Uruth. Nath argued that Wund was selfish and manipulative, and Uruth had an obligation to be a wiser, better king. He gave Uruth the <em>Ettin Axe</em> , optimistically hoping that the axe’s two minds would balance out the bad advice Uruth was getting from Wend.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9455890-b1b6-440d-a8a6-3b26bdb7a092">For a brief time, Wund, Nath, Uruth, and the twin minds of the <em>Ettin Axe</em> were locked in a power struggle for Uruth’s realm. But communications from Nath’s family ceased and, fearing the worst, the wizard fled home to find his family dead from poisons only Wund knew how to brew. Wund’s spies had identified Nath’s family and murdered them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c3b689b-b321-4aa3-807b-d966be4b44de">Nath was devastated. Donning black robes of mourning, he forsook his birth name. For the rest of his life, he wore only black and answered only to Lethchauntos. For twenty years, he researched Wund’s poisons in an attempt to find antidotes to the poisons that killed his family, collecting this knowledge in a book he dubbed the <a href="#TheNathlum" data-content-chunk-id="f714bd05-f06d-423c-9eed-cfb698ad1836">Nathlum</a> , and planned elaborate memorials for his loved ones.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="25088560-6eba-4f9e-ad1a-acf60e1c28a0">Uruth and Wund eventually perished in war, but one of Uruth’s successors discovered Lethchauntos’s location and led a raid against Phandalin, devastating the region.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="210edd0b-f618-4d14-bf06-9719d835e7ce">Lethchauntos survived, but he considered himself cursed for bringing death to his friends and family. He left Phandalin and put his final plans in motion, visiting the Dalelands, Icewind Dale, Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate, places his family had spoken of visiting. In each of these locations, he constructed a hidden library, burying one of his family in each location. When the last library was complete, Lethchauntos departed for the Outer Planes. His final fate is unknown.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="acfbe582-e3b4-403d-ac35-bb06908c3b29">Today Lethchauntos is mostly forgotten, and those who do recall him believe he was an evil wizard due to his association with poison and slaughter. But two students of magic named Myrna Nor and Powell Niccam discovered the existence of the <em>Nathlum</em> from old records found in Phandalin and Wave Echo Cave. The two didn’t agree on what to do next, though. While Myrna wanted to recover the <em>Nathlum</em> for academic purposes, Powell saw an opportunity to get rich quick.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fdb6326e-01c2-463f-8db1-ffa6ca55de63">Powell reached out to Zhentarim agents and told them about the <em>Nathlum</em> , which details many deadly poisons. She offered to share the knowledge with the Zhentarim in exchange for the agents’ help in recovering the <em>Nathlum.</em> With Zhentarim allies and goblin and hobgoblin mercenaries she hired along the way, Powell set out for the hidden library near Myth Drannor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="58a391a3-3112-40d9-bd86-361333936f85">Myrna wants to stop Powell, but she’s no adventurer. She uses her merchant contacts to locate the characters, and she hires them to stop Powell and recover the <em>Nathlum.</em></p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="36aee61d-3853-4a5d-9e0c-9b0b16a381b5">When you’re ready to start the adventure, read or paraphrase the following:</p>

<aside class="text--quote-box" id="YoumeetattheOldSkullInn">
    <p>You meet at the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale. Your host is Myrna Nor, the heir to a wealthy Sembian trading house. When you arrive, she gestures toward chairs in a rustic sitting room. “Please, make yourselves comfortable. I’m so grateful to you all for meeting me here. I have a terrible problem, and I’m hoping you can solve it.</p>
    <p>“My colleague Powell Niccam and I learned of a hidden library built by a long-dead orc wizard named Lethchauntos. He wrote the <em>Nathlum</em> , a book of arcane lore that we believe is located in this hidden library. But Powell has offered to sell the tome’s secrets to the Zhentarim!</p>
    <p>“The <em>Nathlum</em> details how to create many rare poisons, as well as their cures. Who knows what the Zhentarim would do with such knowledge? No, the <em>Nathlum</em> —and the rest of the library—must be recovered for the good of Faerûn.”</p>
</aside>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5b19a12b-2cae-4297-9408-0508acc54dd2">Myrna offers the characters 100 GP each to travel to the library and recover the <em>Nathlum.</em> She can answer questions about Lethchauntos, Powell, and the <em>Nathlum.</em> She can tell the characters the information in “ <a href="#LethchauntossTragicLife" data-content-chunk-id="5c79fd36-1c07-4d4c-aecb-6de471a58210">Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life</a> ” above, which she has pieced together though she’s eager to obtain more evidence. She insists Lethchauntos wasn’t an evil wizard but a tragic and well-meaning figure, if sometimes misguided.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="466cd61c-828a-4ec1-b515-af912c2111b7">Myrna describes Powell as a cunning and brilliant student of magic. Powell is tall and thin, with a wide-eyed, blinking expression that earned her the nickname “the Owl.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1124fc4-3756-4f1a-a831-c018352df093">As for the <em>Nathlum</em> , Myrna knows the tome contains poison recipes and powerful spells, but she doesn’t know the exact details.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05bfc7c0-c5f6-4918-8986-eb02fc02bde0">Myrna provides the location of the library’s entrance in Cormanthor, beneath a hill between the Standing Stone and Myth Drannor. She tells the characters Lethchauntos built five hidden libraries, reburying one of his family members at each, but she believes the <em>Nathlum</em> is at this one.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3da8a31c-fadc-4f3c-8b9d-35ec527178e3">The journey to the library is about 100 miles, a journey of 4 days.

Along the way, the characters can get to know each other, sharing elements of their backstories as they travel.</p>

The wolf statue is a dangerous trap, and the glass sphere imprisons a creature; see below for more on both. The words written above the entrances are in the Orc language and read, “The wolf does not bite the hand that feeds it.” This is a clue to avoiding or disarming the trap.</p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="5af608d0-513b-4b38-b33e-0a2f0a8306b1"><strong><em> Trap. </em></strong> The wolf statue is a magical trap. If a creature touches the table or anything on it—including the glass sphere—without first disarming the trap, the statue fills the room with toxic gas. Each creature in the room when the trap activates makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap resets after 1 minute.</p>

Lethchauntos imprisoned the iota in the sphere long ago and accidentally abandoned it when he left. The sphere has 1 Hit Point and breaks if dropped or thrown at the ground. If the sphere breaks, Regret is freed.</p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="fba07ce1-930e-49ae-8deb-f8363338b30a">If a character approaches the sphere, it pulses faintly with silver light. A character touching the sphere makes contact with Regret’s mind and hears the words, “Set me free, I beg you!” in their mind.</p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="2b6af4bf-1a1c-4888-a1e6-55e812f81e5e">Regret can communicate mentally with anyone touching the sphere. It pleads with the characters to break the sphere and free it, promising to use its powers on their behalf, but it refuses to carry out evil actions. If Regret is freed, it makes good on its promise, assisting the characters with any encounters on this level of the library, including area 8. Regret won’t go further into the library, and after assisting the characters for up to 1 day, it flees the library.</p>

Scirocco pleads with the characters to be released and assists them if freed, under the same restrictions Regret would have. Scirocco is obsessed with the Calim Desert and might accompany the party longer if they agree to help it learn about the desert.</li>

Falchia speaks to the party if any of them know Primordial (Ignan), telling them of the weapon’s making. She wants to see <em>Lethchauntos’s Legacy</em> used by heroic individuals and offers the party the weapon. If unable to communicate with the characters, Falchia gestures to the greataxe and allows the characters to take it, then resumes working the forge.</li>
