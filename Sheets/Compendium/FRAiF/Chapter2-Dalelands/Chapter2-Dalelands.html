  <p class="fraif-dropcap">
    The Dalelands are broad forest vales with rolling farmlands, linked by narrow trade roads
    running through beautiful woods. Blessed with fertile soil and a temperate climate (but harsh
    winters), the Dalelands are the breadbasket of the Heartlands. The independent spirit of
    Dalefolk balanced with their centuries of cooperation with the elves of Cormanthor have made the
    Dalelands the home of many of Faerûn’s greatest heroes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The oldest dales were founded over a thousand years ago by refugees from war-torn regions to the
    east and south. They found the immense, primeval forest of Cormanthor, home to an ancient elf
    civilization. Eltargrim, leader of the elves at the time, created the Dales Compact: an
    agreement that stated in return for promising not to cut deeper into the forest, the Dalefolk
    were allowed to settle around the forest’s edges or in places where the great trees didn’t grow.
    Spellcasters from both sides worked together to raise the Standing Stone in the center of
    Cormanthor as a symbol of unity. Elves opened the city of Myth Drannor to the Dalefolk, and a
    golden age flourished for centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, Myth Drannor is abandoned, but the Dalefolk still keep the Dales Compact. Eleven dales
    exist today, each with its own territory, government (or lack of it), militia, trading pacts,
    ambitions, and character. But dales come and go, their fortunes waxing and waning in the face of
    foreign invasion, internal rivalries, and simple bad luck.

  The Dalelands encourages adventure in the classic heroic fantasy tradition. Here, goblin bandits
  ride worgs out of the forest to raid villages and towns. Dragons emerge from mountaintop lairs to
  hunt for food and plunder. Every village has an inn or tavern where a retired adventurer tells
  stories about the treasure that got away. Greedy empires threaten the borders, evil mercenaries
  scheme in the shadows, and any cellar could have a door to the Underdark.

  live in a land with few laws, where self-sufficiency is vital. But immigrants to the Dalelands
  must build their homes in the shadow of an ancient and primeval forest filled with monsters and
  long-forgotten magic. Life in the Dalelands is hard, but the people here are determined to defend
  it.

  The ancient elven city of Myth Drannor lies at the heart of the Dalelands. Once a magical
  metropolis, Myth Drannor was abandoned centuries ago, and the magical protection known as a mythal
  that lies at its heart is failing. Myth Drannor is a megadungeon: an adventure site so large that
  no single party of adventurers could hope to explore it all. Instead, adventurers gather
  information on the ruined city, explore a region until resources run out, and then return home to
  rest and sell their loot to fund their next round of exploration.

  Although Dalefolk are a diverse lot, and the Dalelands isn’t a unified kingdom like Cormyr and
  Sembia, Dalefolk share a history and culture that has remained steady across the centuries. To an
  outsider, Dalefolk seem closemouthed, suspicious, and reserved. Until newcomers are identified as
  friends or foes, Dalefolk prefer civil silence to empty pleasantries. However, Dalefolk are open
  and giving, especially in the common defense. Those accepted as friends by Dalefolk are expected
  to contribute to the defense of the community; life is dangerous out on the Cormanthor frontier,
  and everyone’s expected to pull their weight.

  A Land Born from Unity
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82e946f5-3a3e-4499-b822-3750754cb4c7">
  The Dalelands were born out of an agreement between elves of
  <a href="#Cormanthor" data-content-chunk-id="7673a3be-f4ab-4640-8c3e-b2834a1b6a9f">Cormanthor</a>
  and human refugees from the east and south, and this remains a key element of Dalelands culture.
  Although most elves have left Cormanthor for the remote island of Evermeet, Dalefolk still largely
  honor the Dales Compact.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0fdc4b4-f348-4abd-afcc-7f279304b498">
  Prior to the establishment of the Dales Compact, refugees from lands torn by war and disaster were
  desperate for a place to live, and they eagerly agreed to the pact. But elves of Cormanthor had a
  different perspective on the Dales Compact. They viewed the influx of newcomers to the lands
  surrounding the forest as an inevitability. Thus, the Dales Compact was a means for elves to head
  off conflict with the Dalefolk, as any such conflict might overwhelm even the magic of
  <a href="#MythDrannor2" data-content-chunk-id="23fb69c9-7caf-4f02-9b57-77025fda3eb0"

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f100a84-3a27-49f5-a00c-17403c206b20">
  In the centuries since the creation of the Dales Compact, the tenuous alliance evolved into a true
  partnership. The Dalefolk’s adherence to the terms of the Dales Compact assuaged the elves’ fears
  of conquest, and in time the two sides formed a strong alliance. Elves fought alongside human
  heroes when Myth Drannor fell, and humans have earned their respect. Elves who remain in
  Cormanthor still work alongside Dalefolk to defend the region against threats.

  In the warmer months, the inhabitants of Tangled Trees venture into the forest. They patrol the
  roads, trails, and paths that crisscross through the woods, and every year at least one group
  travels to Myth Drannor to inspect the borders of the ancient city and look for threats that might
  have emerged there. As winter draws near, these expedition parties return to Tangled Trees to rest
  and prepare for the year to come.

  Myth Drannor
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa6ea6c5-3ed5-428a-8a86-cc395e4a94d6">
  Myth Drannor was once the greatest city in Faerûn, a magical metropolis constructed by elves but
  home to people of all species, invited into Cormanthor on the establishment of the Dales Compact.
  However, Myth Drannor fell eight hundred years ago, torn by internal strife, wracked by magical
  experiments gone awry, and finally invaded by an army of fiends.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1099011-424a-4687-98cb-d872a9cffa6c">
  A little over a century ago, Cormanthor elves reopened Myth Drannor and restored the mythal that
  protected the city. Myth Drannor stood on the threshold of a golden age. But instead, war with the
  Shadovar led to the flying city of Thultanthar crashing into the city in 1487. The mythal failed
  again, and the wreckage of Thultanthar made the ruins of Myth Drannor more dangerous and
  unpredictable than ever. The damage was so extensive that no one knows whether the mythal can be
  repaired again.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5f5bf72-9c0a-4e45-b510-d357bdea103d">
  The city can be divided into two halves. To the west lie neighborhoods built prior to the Dales
  Compact, including the Old City, the Lake Ward (where elves lived in elegant and palatial homes),
  and the Temple Ward. To the east lies the Dlabraddath, an expansion to the city designed to
  accommodate the influx of Dalefolk. Streams running north to south separate these two regions, and
  many bridges cross these streams to connect the two halves of the city.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52f094c6-b1b1-424b-88fd-7afbac0626f9">
  Over centuries, researchers in Myth Drannor conducted extensive magical experiments and spent
  resources on a scale found nowhere else on Faerûn. Not all these experiments are recorded, and
  many still stand as broken monuments, their magic warped by centuries of neglect. Explorers in
  Myth Drannor could stumble on fantastic magic of any kind: massive magical highways that allow
  instant travel across Faerûn, portals to anywhere in the Great Wheel (and even beyond), or even
  structures designed to manipulate time.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f22737d3-62bc-4c7c-862f-9675cc28439b">
  The fall of Myth Drannor created regions of dead magic within the city; see the

  for the rules for dead magic zones. While the largest dead magic zones in the city remain
  relatively stable in permanent locations, smaller dead magic zones move throughout the city in
  unpredictable patterns.

  The Mythal
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d81a9e0-680f-4672-b093-afa9f3fb0b25">
  Myth Drannor was protected by powerful magic called a mythal, which extended the lives of the
  city’s inhabitants, controlled the weather, and had other wondrous uses, ensuring Myth Drannor
  remained a magical paradise. After the first fall of Myth Drannor, the mythal eventually
  deteriorated, its magical effects becoming unpredictable and strange. It was restored for a time
  in the last century, but when the Shadovar city of Thultanthar crashed into Myth Drannor, the
  mythal failed again, this time perhaps beyond repair.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0cb38329-51be-4320-b042-aec39c10d193">
  The mythal now has powerful but unreliable magical effects. Most notably, it blocks most
  teleportation in or out of Myth Drannor (but not within the city walls) and blocks divination
  effects such as scrying. It sometimes protects falling creatures from harm and can extend the
  duration of light-creating spells. But it has also caused strange mutations in those exposed to it
  for more than a few months. The effects of the malfunctioning mythal are impossible to predict.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="213dfda0-7633-4731-8f69-4ede63a8a13c">
  Any attempt to restore Myth Drannor ultimately depends on repairing the mythal. But no one’s sure
  how to accomplish this, or if it’s even possible.

  <p>Megadungeons</p>
  <p>
    Before the creation of D&D, the first dungeons took shape as sprawling tunnel networks beneath
    Castle Blackmoor and Castle Greyhawk. Adventurers explored these fantastic labyrinths one level
    at a time, retreating when resources ran low or after encountering monsters too powerful to
    overcome. Between delves into the dungeon, characters went on other adventures. Fantastic
    adventure sites like this became known as megadungeons.
  </p>

    The abandoned elven city of Myth Drannor is an example of a megadungeon. For guidance on

  Locations in Myth Drannor
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01a2fdd3-1a04-42ea-8668-c1c11d56786e">
  Myth Drannor is a vast and expansive city that could provide years of adventure. Only a few of its
  locations are detailed here.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5da7abdd-99ea-4b74-918c-9da9e638deee">
  <strong><em>Burial Glen.</em></strong> Myth Drannor’s primary cemetery lies outside the walls to
  the west, along a path leading to the city gates. For many adventurers, this is where explorations
  of Myth Drannor begin. Anyone attempting to plunder the crypts must contend with
  [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters], [monsters]Skeleton;Skeletons[/monsters], and
  [monsters]Zombie;Zombies[/monsters] that infest the glen. A triumphal arch in the center of the
  glen is home to a [monsters]Demilich[/monsters], all that remains of the legendary military
  strategist Remarkus.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0e634e5-3f16-4c37-9f19-16787d40d478">
  <strong><em>Dlabraddath.</em></strong> The eastern end of Myth Drannor was built to accommodate
  the influx of people that followed the establishment of the Dales Compact. The architecture here
  stands in contrast to the tall marble spires of the Old City; instead, square brick buildings, low
  houses, and buildings with round doors and windows stand arranged around parks and gardens, linked
  by broad granite roads or waterways. In addition to homes and townhouses, the Dlabraddath boasted
  numerous inns, taverns, and shops.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="81ca9ef5-8c28-49ae-abf9-90e1fe107693">
  <strong><em>Dwarven Dungeons.</em></strong> Dwarf immigrants constructed a three-level
  labyrinthine city beneath Myth Drannor, a settlement known as the Dwarven Dungeons. In the
  centuries since, these tunnels have become home to a bewildering array of dangerous inhabitants,
  including lizardfolk, malevolent undead, and restless spirits of Myth Drannor’s citizens that are
  eager to resolve unfinished business and end their haunting. The Cult of the Dragon, led by the
  [monsters]Dracolich[/monsters] Pelendralaar, controlled the Dwarven Dungeons for many years;
  although Pelendralaar was defeated and the cult routed, the dracolich’s return is inevitable.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d91dc670-a839-4402-8108-64291a427565">
  <strong><em>Glim-Gardens.</em></strong> This large park used to magically heal the bodies and
  nourish the spirits of the city’s residents. Over time, however, the magic of the gardens has
  become corrupted. Now the park’s magic makes wounds reopen, bleed, and fester. Long overgrown, the
  plants of the Glim-Gardens have become hungry for flesh and thirsty for blood.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6991faed-caba-4a19-a808-dbabaf215c54">
  <strong><em>Hall of Wizards.</em></strong> Myth Drannor had many magic academies, where
  spellcasters of all kinds could gather, share their knowledge, select and train apprentices, and
  push the boundaries of magical research. The oldest and most famous of these academies was the
  Hall of Wizards, legendary home of elven magical traditions. This academy contains many magically
  concealed chambers that have avoided plundering. A magical orrery on the college’s grounds can be
  used to teleport anywhere in the city.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52715178-9875-41b1-94e4-c6c3a990cd81">
  <strong><em>House of Gems.</em></strong> A stout keep marks the headquarters for the city’s
  jeweler’s guild. The House of Gems was also home to one of the city’s oldest communities of
  dwarves. Scholars of Myth Drannor suspect the House of Gems is warded with extensive magical and
  mechanical traps, as well as protected by
  <strong>[monsters]Iron Golem;Iron Golems[/monsters].</strong> Doors in the guildhall’s basement
  lead to the Dwarven Dungeons.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a08341a-80df-4ee6-9b0e-a1efabc22e31">
  <strong><em>Old City.</em></strong> In the oldest parts of Myth Drannor, the estates of noble
  families rise intermingled with administrative buildings. Castle Cormanthor, which once housed the
  rulers of the city and ambassadors from across Faerûn, lies ruined in the center of the Old City,
  wrecked by the Netherese flying city Thultanthar.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0bd6a29-fd66-499c-92eb-1f585b17d08c">
  As Thultanthar fell from the sky, pieces of the vessel fell on the Old City like meteors,
  clustering around Castle Cormanthor in the city’s center where aberrant monsters and other strange
  creatures have become increasingly common.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="71741107-9fa7-4f4a-9500-4440eae9e755">
  <strong><em>Temple of Sehanine Moonbow.</em></strong> The city’s temple to Sehanine Moonbow, an
  elven god of dreams, death, and the moon was built near Castle Cormanthor in the Old City. The
  temple is a relatively modest open structure with a dome supported by columns covering a central
  altar with nearby housing for priests. It’s remarkably well preserved, though weathered by rain.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0dfc204-837e-486d-895d-683f28e8a59b">
  As Myth Drannor fell to an army of fiends, priests of Sehanine withdrew to this temple and worked
  high magic to conceal it behind powerful illusions. It remains hidden to this day, appearing to
  explorers as an empty lot.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66c9da9f-1040-400b-84a7-c89fe0334438">
  In fact, the temple remains intact, protected by a [spells]Hallow[/spells] spell that wards
  against Aberrations and Fiends. Additionally, no sound can emanate from the temple, and sounds
  from outside the temple can’t penetrate it. These protections make the temple an excellent place
  for adventurers investigating Myth Drannor to hide, rest, and recover.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="923f1a28-885c-4273-a8a0-d9b344b15796">
  <strong><em>Tower of Bones.</em></strong> On the north side of Myth Drannor, on the site of an
  ancient assault on the city, lies a massive war memorial. Crypts large and small lie scattered
  around a hill that marks a mass grave. Later, necromancers built the Tower of Bones atop the hill
  to facilitate their unwholesome magical experiments. By night, undead wander the region.

  <p>
    The Dalelands consists of a dozen scattered communities, each known as a dale, surrounding the
    ancient forest of Cormanthor. While Dalefolk share history and culture, each dale has its own
    unique character.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the centuries, many dales have risen and fallen. This section details each of the current
    dales, discussing landmarks, settlements, rulers, and customs, as well as two of the dales’ most

  Archendale
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bd116ae2-820f-4ae0-9abe-76c2c7bb3369">
  The most militant region in the Dalelands is also one of the wealthiest. Archendale is the first
  stop for trade between the Dalelands and Sembia—or for Sembia’s periodic invasions—and a place
  where traditional Dalelands occupations like farmer and hunter give way to merchant and soldier.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1b3377f-6f82-41bf-b446-c7b01085da2a">
  The people of Archendale believe mercantile and military strength together keep Archendale safe
  from longtime rivals Sembia and Tasseldale. This principle created a culture in which the people
  of Archendale pursue power and wealth at all costs, fearing the consequences of losing either.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0026941b-8a04-4470-b548-7f932f556bd8">
  Archendale’s rulers are the Swords, masked individuals who keep their identities a mystery. A
  generation ago, the Swords of that time were overthrown and cast out, but the dale’s wealthy and
  well-armed families couldn’t agree on a replacement government. Finally, three new Swords
  presented themselves at
  <a href="#Swordpoint" data-content-chunk-id="27490e62-ceb9-4347-b11b-0d22e4d63885">Swordpoint</a>
  a few years ago, and the dale accepted their rule.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="112bcff8-c6ca-4243-829c-7198357952bb">
  The Archenriders are the dale’s primary defenders, six hundred well-equipped warriors divided into
  ten squadrons that patrol the River Arkhen looking for spies, outlaws, or anyone else who needs a
  lesson in Archendale justice. The Archenriders’ enforcement of the border between Archendale and
  Sembia has cemented their reputation as one of the most fearsome military forces in the Dalelands.

  Archenbridge
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40c94bcf-e385-4cf1-9960-d36dc4d95f73">
  Archenbridge is a heavily fortified town that boasts a stone wall surrounding a cramped inner
  neighborhood known as the Central Ward. Here, many-storied townhouses flank cobblestone streets
  busy with traffic from the rest of the Dalelands and from Sembia. The doors to these buildings
  feature arrow slits and barred windows, and even these ordinary homes are trapped with pits,
  murder holes, and other deadly devices.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="291f1058-c810-4330-b7d5-f153a51f2f1f">
  Many citizens of Archenbridge are merchant-adventurers eager for battle and gold. Due to the
  wealth its citizens bring in, the town is remarkably cosmopolitan, attracting a diverse array of
  shops, taverns, and crafters. The town is dedicated to Lathander but also boasts a famous temple
  to Chauntea called the Bounty of the Goddess.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="615a5b5a-ad21-48d7-8c50-4541859f5b46">
  Archenbridge has spilled outside its walls; residents unable to afford property in the central
  ward built wooden homes and shops outside. When enemies threaten Archenbridge, these outbuildings
  are a liability in the town’s defense, and the Swords have ordered the entire outer town be burned
  to the ground to discourage such settlement. Outrage among Archenbridge’s less-affluent citizens,
  who live in the outer town, has so far blocked this effort.

  Greedy merchants in Archendale have coveted the pristine forest of Arch Wood for many years, but
  Archendale’s new Swords have dictated the forest must be left untouched. That’s because, a century
  ago, early efforts to harvest trees from the forest revealed ancient ruins blossoming with rotted
  vegetation and reeking of death. These structures have since become infested with

  The River Arkhen begins at Arkhen Falls, where a spring on the slope of Mount Thalagbror bursts
  forth and plunges hundreds of feet. [monsters]Pegasus;Pegasi[/monsters] make their home on the
  mountain slopes and sometimes frequent the falls; this lures followers of Chauntea and Mielikki
  eager to observe the pegasi, as well as adventurers looking to tame a mount. The mountain was

  copper and gemstones.

<p data-content-chunk-id="19da6955-dc69-48b6-b02b-dc247a9694a0">
  An intimidating stone fortress called Swordpoint overlooks the town of Archenbridge. It serves as
  a garrison for the Archenriders and a home for the Swords—the dale’s three anonymous rulers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b066efc0-2ddb-4ea3-b19b-c159ee7e2949">
  The castle’s stone walls have been crumbling for centuries. Nevertheless, Swordpoint’s catapults
  and ballistae, combined with its high vantage, make it one of the most formidable fortresses in
  the Dalelands. The central courtyard boasts the Shrine of Swords, dedicated to Tempus, along with
  multiple layers of supplementary defenses, such as movable wooden walls fitted with crossbows,
  moats filled with flammable oil, and rolling platforms with mounted siege weapons.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0fbb0591-7980-44b1-8612-89e6e74122a9">
  The Swords employed a mage named Orosul to create permanent magical wards around the castle and
  treat its stone with a hardening formula derived from the blood of a gorgon. Dwarf masons hired to
  expand the castle added extensive subterranean tunnels, dungeons, and storage chambers capable of
  supplying Archenbridge for a year. At least 180 Archenriders staff the castle at all times.

  Long ago, the folk of Archendale rolled boulders into the River Arkhen to create a ford. A
  fortified village called White Ford grew up around that ford. The village is surrounded by an oval
  stone wall called the Wolf Wall, which protects the village when goblin raiders and their worg
  allies ride down out of the Thunder Peaks. Within the wall, an inner keep called the Arch Hold is
  protected by a ditch and stone wall. A unit of sixty Archenriders is stationed at the Arch Hold.

    “In a land like Battledale, where there are no laws, your friends and kin are your sword and

  The people of Battledale are peace-loving farmers, shepherds, and foresters of no particular
  martial skill. Unfortunately, their homes lie along a central and strategic route invaders of the
  Dalelands frequently take. Battledale is named for the many pitched battles that have taken place
  within its borders, much to the dismay of the folk who live here.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ed1ffe30-69eb-45e8-bb41-9bde4533cc9a">
  Rauthauvyr’s Road runs through central Battledale, a key highway leading from Ordulin in the south
  to Hillsfar in the north. Dense forests, rolling hills, and pastureland flank the road. The most
  fertile part of Battledale is the Belt, a region of fenced farms and cottages, orchards, and sheep
  pastures blessed with fish-filled streams and ponds. Stone tables sacred to Chauntea line paths
  and trails; locals leave food on these tables for weary and hungry travelers. Meanwhile, followers
  of Silvanus mark that deity’s influence by stringing bells over the Belt’s many pools and woodland
  springs.

  This land is sparsely populated; the ravages of war and dangerous beasts have left many farms
  abandoned. Some former adventurers like to settle here, drawn to a fertile land and a wilderness
  that needs taming, but people who grow up in Battledale tend to leave.

  Five centuries ago, Aencar the Mantled King rose to power in Battledale and began an effort to
  unite the Dalelands. He almost succeeded. But Aencar was lured back to the Battledale town of
  Essembra, where he was ambushed by a dracolich and slain. His dream of a united Dalelands died
  with him, but the people of Battledale revere that dream and his memory.

  A few years ago, a silver-scaled dragonborn named Volsembra (Medium, Lawful Good
  [monsters]Knight[/monsters]) led a group of families back to the ruined town of Essembra, where
  she took the title of Protector of Battledale and began the town’s reconstruction. Volsembra
  commands the Spears of Battledale, a troop of one hundred [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] who
  safeguard the town and patrol Rauthauvyr’s Road.

  Battledale has no formal laws; folk tend to their own affairs. Those suspected of a crime are
  tried by their neighbors, who mete out whatever justice they think appropriate. Serious problems
  can be brought to Protector Volsembra, but she has no authority beyond the town in which she
  dwells. She hires adventurers to investigate problems brought to her attention, as she’s busy with
  the reconstruction efforts in Essembra.

  Two centuries ago, Tempus manifested in a shattered castle; soon after, a follower of Tempus
  rebuilt some of the fortress and founded the Abbey of the Sword here. When Sembian forces invaded
  Essembra, the refugees sought shelter here, and the survivors built a town called Ambrose around
  the abbey. Now, however, Volsembra has led them back to their old homes, and Ambrose has been
  abandoned.

  The underground levels of the abbey contain portals to the Underdark through which nomadic drow

  From Rauthauvyr’s Road, the old manor of the Mantled King appears inviting, with well-tended
  gardens overlooked by statues of mounted knights, and inner chambers lit by warm fireplaces. The
  folk of Battledale use these gardens and other areas around the manor as the site for their
  regular Shieldmeet festivals, every four years, strictly avoiding the manor’s interior.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08e53771-f9bc-4c91-a9bf-46599e009278">
  That’s because the interior is haunted by [monsters]Ghost;Ghosts[/monsters],

  corpse of Aencar (Medium [monsters]Death Knight[/monsters]). Aencar was killed by a dracolich, so
  the Cult of the Dragon has long felt entitled to Aencar’s property; they maintain a hideout in the
  manor, from which they summon and strengthen the undead that haunt it while the cult explores
  tunnels underneath the manor that connect to the Underdark.

  revealed herself to be a dragon in disguise. Cottages and farms line the road leading to Battle

  Essembra was abandoned for years after Sembians and their Shadovar allies sacked it and burned it
  to the ground. Now the dragonborn Volsembra, Protector of Battledale, leads the reconstruction
  efforts, with help from adventurers willing to clear out ruined buildings inhabited by outlaws,
  wild beasts, or restless undead. Volsembra is widely believed to be related to Essembra, but she

  Centuries ago, refugees fleeing ancient wars founded the realm of Merrydale, forging alliances
  with the dwarves of Tethyamar, which lay to the west. But a succession of disasters—including an
  infestation of vampires, occupation by the Zhentarim, and a plague of lycanthropy—left the people
  here anything but merry. Somewhere along the line they changed the realm’s name to Daggerdale, and
  the survivors became a close-knit, insular people who keep their doors locked, their mouths shut,
  and their weapons handy.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22a8edce-7eff-4f4e-8647-3f4f360593ac">
  Daggerdale lies south of the Border Forest, stretching to the Dagger River and beyond. Rolling
  plains and rocky valleys give this realm a different character than the wooded dales to the south
  and east. Families of dwarf miners, primarily the Brightblade clan, dwell in Anathar’s Dell, along
  with human and elf farmers. The village of Serpentbridge grew up around an old and unstable span
  crossing the Dagger River.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ef616992-f336-4ffa-b010-b5fe82871bb4">
  For centuries the Morn family ruled Daggerdale. The legendary hero Randall Morn was ousted by the
  Zhentarim but led a successful rebellion, reclaiming his throne before eventually dying in his
  sleep and leaving no heir. Members of the noble family of Cormaeril, related to the Morns by
  marriage, moved into Castle Daggerdale and ruled for three generations, but the citizens of the
  dale never accepted them. Barathal Cormaeril, the last such ruler, was forced to flee when his
  sister Neranya was revealed as a werewolf.

<p data-content-chunk-id="3b596041-f1c4-4864-a05a-5b04121a4363">
  Finally, only a few years ago, the foremost priest at the temple of Lathander’s Light divined that
  a scion of the Morn family survived, unaware of their own bloodline. Young Kirkland Stone, the son
  of a beryl miner from the

  idealistic but cautious, quick to listen to advisers but slow to make decisions. But the people of

  continue the family name.

  Deepingdale was founded by a sorcerer named Imryll Eluarshee, who is known as the Deeping
  Princess. More than any other dale, Deepingdale is dedicated to respecting the forest and living

  The people of Deepingdale are foresters, hunters, trappers, and rangers; the forest provides
  everything they need, so long as they don’t abuse it or take its gifts for granted. Deepingdale
  families value learning, song, and martial skill. They take a long view when it comes to crises
  and emergencies, arguing that problems often resolve themselves if left alone; but when they’re
  proven wrong, Deepingdale folk swiftly rise to the occasion.

  The dale is organized around the East Way, a major trade road connecting Cormyr and Sembia.
  Merchants from both realms make the markets in Highmoon among the most popular in the Dalelands.
  The villages Bristar and Moonrise Hill lie north of the road, deep in the forest. Hamlets and
  smaller groupings of family homes lie scattered throughout the dale, especially in the eaves along
  the forest edge.

  the Wardens of Deepingdale protects the dale when necessary. Bristar contributes a company of

  <strong><em>Leaves of Learning.</em></strong> The Leaves of Learning is a temple to Oghma that
  houses one of the most famous libraries in Faerûn. The library, held in a great spire that
  overlooks even the Tower of the Rising Moon, specializes in mundane topics; this has spared the
  library from intrusion by rapacious wizards and power-hungry invaders. Unfortunately, the
  library’s index, a single massive volume bound with gold and encrusted with gems, was recently
  stolen—a grievous blow to both the library’s reputation and its usefulness. The human priest
  Thanali (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]) oversees the temple and has given up
  on locating the index, since any reward she can offer would be but a fraction of what the book is
  worth. Her only hope now is to find adventurers who revere Oghma and will recover the book out of
  religious obligation.

  fortress. This frivolous reputation belies Ulath’s wise leadership, however. Ulath traditionally
  keeps an adviser trained in the arcane arts, the so-called Sage of Deepingdale. Unfortunately, no
  one has been able to hold this title for long, dying by accident, on adventure, or from
  assassination. The position has acquired a dire reputation, and Ulath can no longer find anyone
  willing to accept the job.

  in a brief, bloody, and unjust war. Sessrendale’s capital was the town of Sessrenglade, but

  Emergencies and long-simmering regional affairs are addressed at a Dalemeet: a gathering of family
  elders and prominent business leaders at Feather Falls or Blackfeather Bridge. Whoever shows up
  for the Dalemeet debates any issues brought forward, attempting to persuade others in attendance
  or forge a consensus. Any decision must be enforced by the winning party, as the dale has no
  constable or other law enforcement body. Family ties, friendships, and reciprocal relationships
  are crucial to getting things done in Featherdale. Crime is dealt with through vigilante justice,
  resulting in feuds between families that go back generations.

  The lack of military defenses throughout Featherdale makes the realm an easy target for invaders,
  but the people of Featherdale aren’t rich, and they have little to arouse the envy of wealthy
  Sembian nobles. The wide river plain, however, makes an excellent highway to more lucrative
  targets, so armies frequently sweep through Featherdale en route to those targets. These armies
  don’t linger long, as all are eventually driven out by the forces of more militant dales.

  Featherdale is a good neighbor to the other dales, its people have family ties throughout the
  Dalelands, and they are a reliable and prudent voice on the Dales Council. When Featherdale is in
  need, the goodwill they have earned is repaid to them. In the meantime, they keep their heads
  down. Many of the families in Featherdale trace their origin to adventurers who retired to the
  dale, leaving a life of danger behind in favor of home and family. This legacy contributes to the
  idiosyncratic political views of Featherdale folk, but it also means many a house, ranch, farm,
  and cottage has a magic item stowed away for emergencies—and someone ready to use it to defend
  their home.

  One of the few bridges across the wide River Ashaba, Blackfeather Bridge originally was a humble,

  The deity Cyric killed Leira, god of deception, on the original wooden Blackfeather bridge over a
  century ago. Leira eventually returned, but the bustling bridge has become a pilgrimage site for
  Cyric’s faith. The village employs no guards, so these evil pilgrims usually go undetected amid
  the bridge’s daily traffic. They don’t conduct schemes in the village, as that would attract
  attention and endanger their holy site, but they use the bridge as a rendezvous point where they
  exchange news and hatch schemes enacted elsewhere in the Heartlands.

  Feather Falls refers to both a waterfall over which the River Ashaba plunges and the village
  situated at the waterfall’s summit. This village is one of the largest and oldest settlements in
  the dale and a traditional mooring place for local keelboats. In addition to Cholandrothipe’s
  Tower (see below), which overlooks the falls, the village includes the House of Morning, one of

  A portage path winds alongside the falls, where individuals can earn a living transporting cargo.
  Behind the waterfall lies a series of hidden grottoes referred to as the Temple behind the Falls.
  No one is quite sure what entity was once worshiped in these grottoes, but its evil reputation is
  spread in stories told round the campfire or when parents want to frighten disobedient children.

  <strong><em>Cholandrothipe’s Tower.</em></strong> Cholandrothipe was a wizard who used his mighty
  magic to move heavily laden boats safely over Feather Falls. He charged a sizable fee for this
  service, but merchants paid it anyway to save the considerable time, labor, and money portage
  otherwise required. The wizard dwelled in a tall, slender tower with a single porch-like entrance,
  and no one was permitted entry.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62838b19-0481-4ef4-ba82-217efb001598">
  But Cholandrothipe concealed many secrets, and he drew the attention of Red Wizards who killed him
  and set his tower aflame. Subterranean levels beneath the tower house dreadful dungeons and
  tunnels to the Underdark, still guarded by deadly traps and magical Constructs, but
  Cholandrothipe’s wealth continues to lure adventurers. Some of these adventurers are affiliated
  with the Red Wizards, though they conceal that allegiance from vengeful villagers.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f424348e-e143-4d1d-8cc4-355fc1b144c6">
  The oldest of the dales, Harrowdale was founded over a thousand years ago by an adventurer named
  Velar, and for centuries this realm was called Velardale. But a cruel tyrant named Halvan rose to
  power and used dale labor to cut a path through
  <a href="#Cormanthor" data-content-chunk-id="79a90bc8-90a4-422b-9053-de5bcca60a64">Cormanthor</a>

    >Myth Drannor</a
  >. Ostensibly intended to forge a new trade route to Hillsfar, the Halfaxe Trail—as this road came
  to be known—would have allowed Halvan to plunder the great elf city at the heart of the woods, but
  the city’s defenders killed him instead.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3df48849-8da7-43fc-aa27-21d9d35dd354">
  After Halvan’s death, the dale chose a new form of government: the Council of Seven Burghers, made
  up of the wealthiest individuals in the dale. The council renamed the realm Harrowdale in an
  attempt to break with the past. Decades ago, a temporary alliance with fey living in Cormanthor
  led the burghers to pave the old Halfaxe Trail into a road to Myth Drannor they named the Harrow
  Ride, but the road was soon abandoned, and its stones became overgrown and cracked. Now the ride
  serves as little more than a dangerous invitation to adventurers. Harrowdale has laws against
  chopping down the trees of Cormanthor, and the folk here have a phrase for those who, like Halvan,
  trespass too far into the forest; such people are said to be “deep in the Green.”

  When Scardale Town collapsed into chaos and lawlessness decades ago, Harrowdale Town just up the

  never been found. Guards have all but given up trying to keep people out; instead, they charge a
  fee of 50 GP to any group seen entering or leaving the ruins. This keeps out locals but not
  professional adventurers, who have reported all manner of deadly creatures within the keep,
  including the restless spirits of prisoners who died in Halvan’s dungeons.

  and other elves who maintain Shadowtop Glade, a shrine to Eilistraee in the northern reaches of
  the forest. The elves dwell in caves on either side of a deep gully shielded by wide-reaching
  trees. They conceal their presence from those who work the forest but are friendly to those who
  discover their presence, as long as the strangers vow to keep the shrine’s location secret.

  High Dale
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4929cbc-0284-4ace-b1a4-adbaa316e629">
  High Dale is one of the least-known dales, but that’s just how the people of High Dale like it.
  The dale lies along a mountain pass known as Thunder Way; this pass leads from Cormyr and the town
  of Thunderstone east through the Thunder Peaks to the town of Saerb in Sembia. Many traders take
  this route, helping to sustain High Dale.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="94e9b5fc-423b-4f8f-a850-28d16102a42f">
  High Dale is sandwiched between the two great realms of Cormyr and Sembia. It is protected by
  harsh terrain, a famous company of mercenary archers, and an ancient defense treaty with Cormyr.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55c7d3aa-16dd-447b-bccf-03dfeaa86fc6">
  Although the mountainous region High Dale occupies is plagued by snow and other harsh weather in
  the winter, most of the dale lies atop a high plateau that’s excellent for farming. Over the
  centuries, farmers have also carved terraces into the sides of the nearby mountains, further
  expanding their farms. Several small valleys branch off Thunder Way, and the people of High Dale
  make their homes there in rugged mountain cabins clustered in small groups.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b12fe13-9b75-448e-b39e-0942cd0aab8a">
  The political and administrative affairs of High Dale are managed by a high constable chosen by
  the people of the dale. The current high constable is Cordance Coppercroft, a gnome engineer who
  led the effort to revive the dale’s exhausted copper mines. High Constable Coppercroft is a
  respected but private individual; he accepted the job mostly so that people would stop pestering
  him about it. His constables gather information throughout the dale and fill out reports that he
  reads in his study. While such insular behavior might alarm the people of other dales, the folk of
  High Dale respect privacy, and they’re content to let the high constable govern as he sees fit, so
  long as everyone is left alone to pursue their lives in peace.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ea382d9b-d5ec-453f-a4b4-7edbd95e2974">
  Eight centuries ago, more than a dozen deities manifested in a hidden valley a few miles northwest
  of High Castle, an event called the Gathering of the Gods that led to the founding of the Harpers.
  Ever since, this valley has been a pilgrimage site visited by thousands every year. It is said
  that anyone infected with a magical contagion will be cured after sleeping one night in the
  Dancing Place; these cures are said to be accompanied by visions of the gods, who assign a quest
  to the cured individual.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2018b30-c2d1-4824-a905-976954d50882">
  Clerics of Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, and Silvanus maintain the Dancing Place, which they
  have transformed into an enormous garden. The moss-covered hill where the gathering took place is
  surrounded by a stream that threads through a ring of duskwood trees. Temples to the deities
  honored in the Dancing Place fill the valley, along with hostels and other establishments that
  cater to pilgrims. As part of the treaty with Cormyr, a war wizard is permanently stationed here.
  Over the centuries, this has become a retirement posting for distinguished war wizards too
  physically frail to go on campaign.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6302c61b-7a38-4e3d-b34e-80b1f8de557e">
  The Dancing Place is well protected, though most pilgrims never notice these defenses. A group of
  druids known as the High Dance guards the valley’s borders. Harpers keep caches of vital equipment
  around the valley’s edge but don’t interact with the temples and pilgrims so as to avoid drawing
  travelers into dangerous Harper operations.

  A large population of gnomes dwells in the remote valley known as Hidden Vale. In fall and winter,
  dense, swirling fog shrouds Hidden Vale, but in spring and summer, the fog retreats to reveal
  sweeping vistas of colorful alpine wildflowers. The gnomes dwell in ancestral cottages along the
  rim of the valley and traditionally kept to themselves. Over the last century, however, younger
  gnomes have increasingly left the vale, seeking new experiences in High Dale proper, and the

  Winters in Highcastle can be inhospitable, with heavy snow and freezing temperatures; the High
  Fire Tavern is usually the only refuge in town for winter travelers. High Constable Coppercroft

  however, the wyverns are more populous than ever. Hunters tell tales of unusually intelligent
  wyverns that rule over the others, even suggesting the wyverns construct defensive walls out of
  boulders along the mountain slopes and herd sheep in secure valleys accessible only by air. The
  Purple Dragons of Cormyr insist these reports point to

  Six councilors, elected from across the dale, make up a ruling body called the Council of Six.
  They in turn select another individual to act as grand councilor and command the dale’s military

  The villages, hamlets, and isolated farms of Mistledale communicate via sets of bells rung in

  Historically, Scardale has been one of the most influential of the dales. It benefits from clear

  The River Ashaba flows through Scardale, and countless farms, mills, and ranches line its shore.
  The current here is swift, as the river rushes from waterfall to river mouth, but the river is too

  Scardale Town to barter with local traders, who then make the laborious journey upstream to sell
  goods in Chandlerscross.

  Scardale’s most infamous citizen was Lord Lashan Aumersair, who was a descendant of the legendary
  archmage Elminster and attempted to conquer the dales. An alliance of many Realms defeated Lashan,
  and for a time Scardale was ruled by a coalition of the victors of this war. Sembia, Scardale’s
  chief trading partner, even managed to assimilate Scardale for a time. Then the infamous fallen
  paladin Scyllua Darkhope seized control, armed with a will declaring her Lashan’s heir. Proving
  the apple hadn’t fallen far from the tree, Scyllua also led a conquest of the dales. More

  The busy town of Chandlerscross is positioned near the foot of Feather Falls. Unlike the
  cosmopolitan Scardale Town, Chandlerscross is inhabited almost entirely by farmers, ranchers, and
  artisans whose families have been here for generations. The town is patrolled by a diligent and
  well-mannered militia. The ruler of the town is the wood elf Abyssa Whitelock (Medium, Lawful Evil
  [monsters]Gladiator[/monsters]), a former adventurer; she watches outsiders closely before quickly
  and politely urging them to move along. Those who refuse are first thrown into the town jail, then
  evicted from the town.

  While Scardale Town was at its most lawless, Chandlerscross temporarily became the capital of the
  dale, but locals are happy the town has since returned to a quiet life of obscurity, unbothered by

  Oceangoing vessels can’t navigate all the way upriver to Chandlerscross. The town of Scarsdeep was
  founded where most such vessels are forced to turn around. A comparatively young settlement,
  Scarsdeep draws in farmers and merchants looking to expand their market. Entrepreneurs frequently

  Scardale Town is the capital of Scardale and was once the largest city in the Dalelands, but its
  fortunes have waxed and waned over the years. After a long period of rebuilding, Scardale Town is
  growing into a proper city once more. About five thousand people call this settlement home, but
  the dockside neighborhood is crowded with merchants, travelers, and adventurers from across
  Faerûn. Adventurers can find items worth up to 2,000 GP in Scardale Town’s many markets, and
  potentially more valuable items in the cargo of ships docked at port.

  Lord Kharu Aumersair
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18b2bb9c-9ecc-44c4-80e3-fa4f7c0e5fe4">
  Lord Kharu Aumersair (Medium, Lawful Evil [monsters]Noble Prodigy[/monsters]) is the ruler of
  Scardale and the tiefling son of the infamous fallen paladin Scyllua Darkhope, Scardale’s previous
  ruler. Scyllua’s claim to the throne of Scardale was based on a written document, supposedly the
  testament of Lashan Aumersair, claiming that Scyllua was his daughter. Kharu’s right to rule is
  also based on this document.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf739113-182e-4c79-b50a-f70726c52694">
  But Scyllua had deep ties to the Zhentarim, which benefited greatly from her rise to power in
  Scardale, and many Dalefolk believe the document establishing her as Lashan’s heir was forged by
  Zhents. If the letter were ever proven to be forged, Kharu Aumersair’s right to rule Scardale
  would evaporate.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b07dbb9d-f177-4fe9-8d38-1d6a98a2752d">
  To shore up his power in Scardale Town, Kharu has forged alliances with the town’s local criminal
  syndicates, giving them free rein dockside as long as they help him contain the Zhentarim, the Red
  Wizards, and economic aggression from Sembia. Kharu is charismatic and brings order to Scardale’s
  docks and byways; the townsfolk put up with a certain amount of political corruption if it means
  they can safely walk the streets at night.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9542e303-df48-4479-955a-b67b21df4762">
  If Kharu can indeed bring peace to this infamously lawless city, the people seem likely to accept
  his rule, but rivals like the Zhentarim and Sembia are eager to see him fall, and they intend to
  seize power for themselves or simply allow Scardale Town to fall back into chaos.

  Crime in Scardale
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ee8568b-4f31-420c-8515-386a96671f86">
  Three criminal syndicates—the Dancers, the Shaker Gang, and the Stallions—compete in Scardale
  Town. The Dancers is a gang of well-armed [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] with a lucrative
  protection racket, fleecing merchant ships and port businesses. The gang’s leader is a halfling
  named Finchley (Small, Chaotic Evil [monsters]Tough Boss[/monsters]).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6e141d5-61fd-4fbf-a9d8-e377a809313d">
  The Shaker Gang runs gambling operations throughout the city as a cover for its extensive burglary
  operations. The human Boss Eli Sneed (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Bandit Crime Lord;Bandit
  Crime Boss[/monsters]) commands the Shaker Gang from his palatial mansion overlooking the river.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="510f3afb-4394-47c2-be03-be57c57265ef">
  Finally, the Stallions is a band of [monsters]Pirate;Pirates[/monsters] based out of the
  <em>Sea Stallion</em>, a wrecked galley outside Scar Harbor; the gang’s primary business is
  smuggling, but it also hires out for short seafaring exploits if the money is good. The gang is
  led by the wood elf Captain Walenna Eventide (Medium, Chaotic Neutral [monsters]Pirate
  Captain[/monsters]).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="097fb6d1-873a-425d-84be-45d4052a91cb">
  These three syndicates fought turf wars years ago and nearly destroyed each other; now they eye
  each other warily but usually leave each other alone. There’s one thing Scardale Town’s three
  crime syndicates can agree on: foreign powers should never again be allowed to rule the dale. It
  is for this reason that they’ve agreed to work with Lord Aumersair, regardless of his dubious
  claims.

<p data-content-chunk-id="5479cb00-d439-4847-b2ee-dc014ec83b4e">
  Scardale Town is a great port at the mouth of the
  <a href="#RiverAshaba" data-content-chunk-id="78f46299-d017-4971-b4e8-9bd5ac4a4e63"
    >River Ashaba</a

  most of the town is built.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a8408af-5e66-4922-bc93-0a7c683a1b82">
  The river is crossed by two bridges: the smaller Dawnstar Bridge in the west and the larger Anvil
  Bridge halfway through the city. The eastern half of the town is dominated by Port Ashaba. Several
  inns and taverns cater to Scardale’s diverse population. The Spouting Fish and the Fatted Calf are
  among the quietest, while the Singing Siren is infamous for its rowdy brawls. The Zhentarim uses
  the Dragon’s Tail as a base of operations.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f4f5615-57c7-4fb0-be36-8984a5ca920a">
  The oldest religious buildings in town are shrines to Tymora and Tempus that have survived the
  town’s many calamities. The orc Sigora Swordwise (Medium, Chaotic Neutral
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters]) maintains the shrine to Tempus, and the high elf Rhodantha Sneed
  (Medium, Chaotic Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]), who is married to the leader of the Shaker
  gang (see above), tends the shrine to Tymora.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1320741c-873c-4ef3-a3a9-eaeb13e59159">
  <strong><em>Four Dolphins Fountain.</em></strong> The famous Four Dolphins Fountain, which depicts
  four leaping dolphins, lies near the port. It’s surrounded by a courtyard where tourists and
  criminals gather. But the fountain’s real claim to fame is a powerful magical effect that allows
  individuals within the courtyard to meet privately without being scried on. Kharu Aumersair uses
  this property of the fountain to meet with the leaders of the town’s various criminal syndicates.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f96a11b7-a631-4e02-8c4f-e6f14071209b">
  <strong><em>Harborwatch Keep.</em></strong> Harborwatch Keep, the ancestral home of the Aumersair
  dynasty, stands on the far east end of town, overlooking the entrance to Scar Harbor and Port
  Ashaba. The central stronghold is an impressive round tower buttressed by a curtain wall facing
  the sea that protects from bombardment. Lord Aumersair wants Scardale Town to become the permanent
  host for the Dales Council, so he’s renovating the keep to make it as comfortable and attractive
  to his fellow rulers as possible. Ambassadors from Scardale’s major trading partners—including
  Cormyr, Sembia, and the other dales—keep ambassadors here. The human ambassador from Sembia is
  Dian Selkirk (Medium, Neutral [monsters]Spy Master[/monsters]); she’s busy creating a network of
  informers in town.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8481d1b5-f503-4528-8d6b-cfa03b263ebf">
  <strong><em>Thayan Enclave.</em></strong> The Red Wizards of Thay maintain a modest walled enclave
  in Scardale Town. The wizard in charge is a human named Jenla Hal (Medium, Lawful Evil
  [monsters]Archmage[/monsters]), and she is assisted by [monsters]Mage;Mages[/monsters] and a
  garrison of [monsters]Warrior Veteran;Warrior Veterans[/monsters] and
  <strong>[monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters].</strong> As usual with such enclaves, the land within
  is considered Thayan territory, but Jenla keeps a low profile and abides by the lord’s laws in an
  attempt to win him over and become his chief adviser. The Red Wizards trade in Common and Uncommon
  magic items. Jenla might acquire a Rare magic item for a character willing to do her a favor.

  claiming land in Shadowdale, there’s an old truism: build close enough to see your neighbor’s

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1cdc0a7c-0d49-4f37-b2a3-ab0413eaaf34">
  Shadowdale has historically chosen its rulers by popular acclaim, selecting adventurers who’ve
  done the people of Shadowdale a great service or otherwise proven their valor and selflessness.
  The current ruler, Khara Sulwood, is the great-granddaughter of the former lord of Shadowdale,
  Doust Sulwood, but her true claim to the loyalty of her subjects is that she helped repel an
  assault on the town decades ago. Lady Sulwood is assisted by a loyal bodyguard named Tharinel.
  More information on Lady Sulwood and Tharinel can be found in “Shadowdale Town” below.

<p data-content-chunk-id="6e681e53-4e2f-4c6b-8b15-f9ebf7d0e00f">

  <a href="#RiverAshaba" data-content-chunk-id="399cfd34-538c-45fb-9931-aeea7f5ce1a3"
    >River Ashaba</a
  >. The Northride is a well-maintained but dangerous road leading north from the rebuilt town of
  Tilverton through winding hills that provide havens for robbers and cutthroats; this region is
  called the Shadow Gap and marks the border of Shadowdale. Merchants using the Northride continue
  through the forest to the town of Voonlar, Shadowdale’s longtime rival. Militia patrol the
  Northride, but guarding the road has become a rite of passage for novice adventuring parties.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc9c0365-f443-4840-bed4-62dd47750da6">

  The river is wide and shallow, and minor flooding is common every spring. Many orc families live
  along the river’s edge and offer ferry services for travelers, for the only nearby bridge across
  the river is in Shadowdale Town. The forests of Shadowdale are home to fey, including goblins of
  the Broken Bones clan and an extended family of centaurs called the Sylvan Guardians. These fey
  make travel through the forest dangerous.

  at a key bridge, Shadowdale Town is a sleepy community of about 1,500 people in the shadow of the
  Old Skull, a hill of pale, volcanic rock covered in lichen and grass. Shepherds graze their herds
  on the hill’s grassy slopes, and children play atop the hill’s summit. Tunnels beneath the hill
  extend to the Underdark, and drow invaders have used the Old Skull as an invasion route multiple
  times.

  Lady Khara Sulwood (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Knight[/monsters]) is the human ruler of the
  town and has been in power for a generation. She wears the <em>Pendant of Ashaba</em>, an Artifact

  Sage of Shadowdale
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db0eb230-f56e-450a-9dea-7024d16e5939">
  Shadowdale Town has been home to some of the greatest heroes of Faerûn, most notably Elminster and
  Storm Silverhand.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd3e572f-0123-4744-bb9b-27184c700022">
  A great archmage and former Chosen of Mystra, Elminster lived in a former windmill on the southern
  edge of the Old Skull. The humble, three-story structure, covered in vines and magically restored
  after being nearly destroyed by assassins serving Shar, has been locked up and abandoned for a
  decade now. Elminster hasn’t been seen in all that time.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5803dc04-3f68-4776-9004-dad5d5778bef">
  An old sign still stands along a path leading to the door, reading “No trespassing. Violators
  should notify next of kin. Have a pleasant day.” The tower’s exterior is crowded with lean-tos and
  other patchwork constructions that once held Elminster’s vast collection of books and magical
  trinkets. All these storage facilities are now empty, however.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36f54dcc-f636-4847-93f3-d5391538cc84">
  Elminster protected Shadowdale—and indeed all of Faerûn—for centuries. It would be foolish to
  assume he’s dead, and equally foolish to trespass in his home, so everyone gives the tower a wide
  berth while expecting the old wizard to show up one day as if no time had passed. A few times a
  year, a figure is spotted moving around inside the tower, but they’re always gone by morning.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b54a2775-6c58-43b6-aee6-3426a4cd9e88">
  Shadowdale Town includes temples to Tymora and Lathander; a general store; stables; a central
  well;
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5641065-eda0-412e-b927-22c44fabba2b">
  and many workshops maintained by the town’s blacksmiths, carpenters, and other crafters. A mill
  lies south along the river, while farms line the north shore.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96769dce-bfa3-4551-bfd9-91ff63f70042">
  <strong><em>Druid’s Grove.</em></strong> North of town, well within the forest, stands a circle of
  ancient menhirs. Long ago, this circle was used by a group of druids, but as Shadowdale Town grew,
  the druids retreated deeper into the forest of
  <a href="#Cormanthor" data-content-chunk-id="d0a343b6-ca80-4a03-925d-15e2d32439c9">Cormanthor</a>,
  and this grove was abandoned.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="572b5526-3f20-4915-b639-1957e5a05ed8">
  Many fey live in and around this circle, and the border with the Feywild is thin here. Individuals
  with the proper knowledge can use this stone circle to travel anywhere in Faerûn or the Feywild.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ffe339c6-605a-4c6f-8db0-979366ed479e">
  <strong><em>House of the Lady.</em></strong> The House of the Lady is a temple to Tymora on the
  far west end of town that doubles as a gambling hall and tavern. The domed temple proper is
  protected by a square stone wall. The wall also encloses outbuildings for the temple staff and
  occasional guests. The temple is overseen by the halfling priest Marigold Gambol (Small, Chaotic
  Good [monsters]Priest[/monsters]), a lifelong resident of Shadowdale. Marigold considers herself
  Shadowdale’s chief protector now that Elminster is gone. She works tirelessly in the shadows to
  collect rumors and keep an eye on strangers in town. In public, she appears carefree, but she is
  quick to pull influential residents aside to remind them of the threat posed by drow cultists or
  the Zhentarim.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be70846d-6a50-45cf-9dff-0f7435863fff">
  <strong><em>Morningdawn Hall.</em></strong> Shadowdale’s first temple to Lathander, Morningdawn
  Hall, was an ostentatious landmark: a magically constructed edifice in the shape of a phoenix with
  its wings outstretched. But that temple was destroyed long ago. A replacement was funded by
  adventurers eager for curative magic after repeated expeditions to the Underdark, and it better
  suits the insular and unobtrusive folk of Shadowdale. It boasts a tall spire rising from an
  eastward-facing prayer hall. Adjoining buildings house clergy and lay assistants. The new temple
  retains the name of the original.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c4bae6d-fcd5-4aea-956a-33d2c90d59a0">
  The high elf priest of Lathander is Adanar the Open-Handed (Medium, Neutral Good
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters]), a former adventurer who lives in the spire. Although he’s known for
  his commanding and charismatic presence, Adanar finds joy in the quiet personal acts of his faith,
  tending to the people of Shadowdale and providing them wise counsel. Adanar’s magic is modest, but
  he does have a [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of [spells]Raise Dead[/spells].

  <strong><em>Old Skull Inn.</em></strong> The Old Skull Inn is one of the most famous meeting spots
  for adventurers in Faerûn. Its three stories include a large ground floor taproom and almost
  thirty sleeping rooms, each with a colorful name like “Numpkin’s Rest,” “The Onyx,” or “The
  Huntsman’s Room.” Cellars connect to catacombs beneath Old Skull hill and provide access to the
  Underdark.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="adb54824-808d-4c0b-8e0b-184bb75eb5a6">
  The current proprietor, the halfling Mungo Silvermane (Small, Neutral Good
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]), is still earning the trust of the regulars, but he has a practical
  head on his shoulders and a knack for puns. He’s put this latter talent into practice with weekly
  pun contests; the winner of each event gets their tab cleared.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03eb507c-7ee9-4a28-bc72-5a8e620f90fd">
  Any trouble in the inn is rapidly put down by well-armed patrons. A few Common magic items are
  usually available in the inn, offered for sale by adventurers eager to sell loot.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f504ceba-e119-471c-9f4d-71e1687eaec9">
  <strong><em>Tower of Ashaba.</em></strong> The Tower of Ashaba is a stone fortress raised by
  ancient and evil powers long ago. An off-balance tower rises five stories from a tall, square,
  stone stronghold; this tower’s bizarre shape has earned it the name “the Twisted Tower.” The tower
  was a stronghold for drow cultists until the water wizard Ashaba drove them out four hundred years
  ago and became the first lord of Shadowdale. The rulers of Shadowdale have dwelled here ever
  since, fighting off assaults by Zhentarim, would-be tyrants, and others.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7140569a-33b4-403c-970d-6e31c73f5cdd">
  Lady Sulwood is master of the tower now and maintains a garrison of a hundred
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] under Tharinel’s command. The tower’s three subterranean levels
  include entrances to the Underdark, only some of which have collapsed or been sealed off.

      Tasseldale is a land of wide-open spaces. The twelve villages, or tassels, of Tasseldale are
      connected by the Tasselway, a road that cuts through rolling, mist-covered grassland
      crisscrossed with streams flowing north into the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9d3ce8f7-050e-4404-9db0-44b7e520d985">
      The most notable tassels include Archtassel, Arrowmark, Glaun, Halfcrag, Moontassel,
      Tasselheart, and Tegal’s Mark. The others are so small as to be mere hamlets, with no more
      than a few dozen buildings. The people of Tasseldale are proud farmers, ranchers, and
      crafters. Tasseldale is synonymous with the forging of excellent swords; the capital of
      Tegal’s Mark is the heart of this tradition.
    </p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a0a9614f-4862-4c5e-b5f1-146d590b7ffa">
  The ruler of Tasseldale is Grand Marshair Rora Rudiland (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Warrior
  Commander[/monsters]), a devotee of Tyr and graduate of the Abbey of the Just Hammer (see below).
  She is advised by the Elder Council, consisting of one representative from each of the twelve
  tassels. An excellent swordfighter, Rora inspects the work of Tasseldale’s swordsmiths in an
  annual fair held in the capital of Tegal’s Mark.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2295ee93-4a78-40cd-b7bf-850ab80f1a0b">
  The dale is defended by the Marshairs, a company of sixty mounted warriors who patrol the dale and
  keep the peace; in time of war, however, Tasseldale can raise a large militia of veteran
  swordfighters, many of whom carry high-quality swords passed down as family heirlooms.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3a41cb7-8b7a-4a8a-bc84-c85d233b599e">
  Among the other dales, Tasseldale has a long rivalry with neighboring
  <a href="#Archendale" data-content-chunk-id="abdb9f4c-3990-45a7-ae7f-d5a5d0a2708a">Archendale</a>.
  The roots of this dispute stretch back into murky history, but the heart of it seems to lie with a
  murdered forester in the
  <a href="#ArchWood" data-content-chunk-id="efe0886e-15ea-403f-85e8-01e3678eeef5">Arch Wood</a>, on
  the border between the two dales. This feud erupts into violence every generation, as hotheaded
  youths grow weary of the cautionary tales told them by elders and seek out their rivals under
  cover of the trees.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7dd7584f-159c-49c7-8b3a-762ad1161e83">
  Tasseldale’s long relationship with its wealthy, aggressive neighbor Sembia has shaped this realm
  and its people. Other folk of the Dalelands dismiss the people of Tasseldale as weak-willed
  compromisers who give in to Sembia’s every demand in order to avoid being conquered. But those who
  dwell in Tasseldale know that Sembia can’t be countered through force; diplomacy and strength of
  character will always win the day. This was proven true when Sembia invaded decades ago. When the
  effort stalled, Sembia sent in enough mercenaries to finish the job, but the cost in blood and
  treasure proved too high. About fifteen years ago, Sembia retreated from Tasseldale, returning the
  realm to independent rule.

</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5450ea7f-0118-441b-b9a7-24af66e9bcef">
  The Abbey of the Just Hammer is dedicated to Tyr and, along with the Monastery of the Sun Soul, is
  responsible for the taming of the Dun Hills. The abbey was the site of a legendary battle when
  Deren Eriach, Lord High Justicar of the abbey, slew the ancient green dragon Sirvinhandra with a
  [magicitems]Holy Avenger Greataxe;Holy Avenger (Greataxe)[/magicitems] dubbed the Axe of Heavenly
  Fire. The axe went on to be wielded by a succession of heroes but has been returned to the abbey
  and is now displayed above the foremost altar to Tyr. Sirvinhandra’s lair was never found, though
  green dragons have since been sighted in the region.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6ec5f80b-40e7-472e-bfc3-2672da0956b3">
  The abbey provides legal education to citizens of Tasseldale, making it one of the few places for
  advanced education anywhere in the Dalelands. Lawyers and judges who complete their training at
  the abbey are offered lucrative employment throughout the Heartlands, but many help the poor and
  unfortunate instead.

  [monsters]Peryton;Perytons[/monsters], [monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters],
  [monsters]Will-o’-Wisp;Will-o’-Wisps[/monsters], [monsters]Wyvern;Wyverns[/monsters], and
  countless goblins. Pits of quicksand make travel perilous, and at the center of the bog lie
  ancient barrows inhabited by <strong>[monsters]Wight;Wights[/monsters].</strong> But the bog is
  rich in iron deposits, and swordsmiths of Tasseldale covet this iron for their work.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="324c5377-2292-449a-a140-f0b01f677829">
  Fortunately, locals from the village of Glaun know the bog well. They have learned how to avoid
  the worst of the bog’s dangers, and they venture in to gather iron for smelting and peat for
  burning. Adventurers looking to explore the bog would be wise to hire one of these locals as a
  guide.

<p data-content-chunk-id="4ad07096-3dcb-457a-9066-c491502c2f37">
  Centuries ago, monks following a path known as the Way of the Sun Soul selected a ruined fortress
  in the Dun Hills as their new home. They rebuilt the Monastery of the Sun Soul despite frequent
  goblin raids, and ever since, the monks have cooperated with the Abbey of the Just Hammer to keep
  Tasseldale safe.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b790178-e94c-4541-a551-80324eace2c6">
  The monks accept every prospective student who comes to their door, but the grueling training
  regimen repels many students, and others tire of the monastic life. The monks’ philosophy
  emphasizes intense spiritual discipline that focuses the soul into a fiery source of blazing
  power. Students unusually attached to wealth and a desire for money recieve the most rigorous
  training and scrutiny.

  Tegal’s Mark

<p data-content-chunk-id="e6cbc0d3-416b-4944-b605-d9177d217cca">
  The capital of Tasseldale is Tegal’s Mark, a picturesque village situated between two forested
  hills and surrounded by gardens that include a shrine to Chauntea. An old elven watchtower known
  as the Sharburg was long ago repurposed and now functions as the home to Grand Marshair Rora
  Rudiland. Rora hosts the Tassel Elders at the Sharburg, and the fortress also houses barracks for
  her Marshairs and a dismal dungeon for prisoners.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08dc2685-301d-4e00-b3e8-62175bebcc2f">
  Tegal’s Mark is where the dale’s legacy for sword smithing got its start, as the village was
  founded by the swordsmith Tegal centuries ago. Adventurers seeking excellent swords travel here
  from across Faerûn. But the smiths of Tasseldale are infamously picky about whom they deal with,
  turning away buyers they judge beneath their efforts while making others wait for long periods at
  one of the village’s many taverns, including the Markhouse, the Royal Flagon, and the Sword and
  Sash, the latter of which boasts the village’s only theatrical stage.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="411ba615-cc63-47e1-ae4c-1b82a982e100">
  The village includes dozens of vacation homes owned by wealthy Sembian families. These opulent
  manors are empty most of the year, and locals have come to resent them. Outlaws occasionally take
  refuge in these houses, and they’re often burgled, all of which has led their Sembian owners to
  protect them with layers of security including locks, deadly traps, mechanical guardians, and
  magical wards. Several Sembian merchant companies keep warehouses and administrative offices here,
  making Tassel’s Mark an even more lucrative target for thieves.

  A wizard’s abandoned tower rises on the edge of town. An insidious cult hides its ghastly rituals
  in a warren of caves. Drow cultists raid from the Underdark. Hostile and benevolent fey fill the
  nearby forest, within which a dragon makes its lair. These are elements of classic heroic fantasy

  particularly appropriate for DMs and players who enjoy D&D’s most well-established tropes.

  A campaign in the Dalelands could involve the characters building a home and legacy while
  defending themselves from dangerous forest creatures, Zhentarim agents, and mysterious menaces
  from the Underdark. In a campaign of this sort, the characters make up a family and friends who
  inhabit a Dalelands homestead. The head of the family might be a retired adventurer, or there
  might be former adventurers in the family’s ancestry. Other characters have prominent roles around
  the homestead as, for example, the blacksmith, cook, or herder. The challenges of running the
  homestead can mix with the combat and exploration present in any D&D campaign.

  <strong><em>4: Crash Wreckage.</em></strong> Pieces of Thultanthar fell on the temple here,
  crushing many inhabitants. When the party draws close, six of the corpses animate

  <strong><em>5: Hideout.</em></strong> Beauregard Baxton’s brother Brandon has been transformed
  into a <strong>[monsters]Yeti[/monsters].</strong> He escaped and hid here, unsure what to do. He
  pretends to be a fierce creature if discovered but responds positively if the characters try to
  talk to him. Brandon doesn’t remember much from before his transformation, but he’s eager to find
  his family and protect them.

  <strong><em>6: Ruins.</em></strong> A human forester named Wila Peat was captured by Letha and
  turned into a <strong>[monsters]Cyclops Sentry[/monsters].</strong> Letha told Wila to go find
  more subjects for transmutation, and Wila agreed out of fear. Wila is Indifferent to the
  characters. As an [action]Influence[/action] action, a creature can try to convince her to turn
  against Letha and make a DC 15 Charisma ([skill]Persuasion[/skill]) check, earning Wila’s support
  on a successful check. A character who promises to turn Wila back into a human has Advantage on
  this check.

  <strong><em>8: Transmutation Chamber.</em></strong> Once a day, a character outside the
  transmutation chamber can take the [action]Magic[/action] action to activate it and shape-shift a
  Humanoid or Beast inside the chamber into a creature of another type. (On the day the party
  arrives, the chamber hasn’t been used.) The new form is chosen by the DM. The target’s game
  statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen creature, but the target retains its
  alignment and personality.

  The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form; if the new
  form can’t speak, for example, the target can’t speak either and can’t use Verbal components.

  When the target shape-shifts, its equipment drops to the ground.

  Casting the [spells]Remove Curse[/spells] spell on a creature shape-shifted this way restores it
  to its original form. The effect also ends if the creature dies. Once a creature has been affected
  by the transmutation chamber, the chamber doesn’t work on it again.
