  <p class="fraif-dropcap">
    The Moonshae Isles are realms of ancient magic, fierce storms, and bold heroes, where druids
    safeguard the land and fey lurk in every forest glen. The Moonshaes include seven major islands
    and over a hundred smaller ones, and a variety of cultures call these isles home. The story of
    the Moonshaes tells of peoples coming together to protect their homes, their family, and the
    sacred earth. Tragically, this unity came about only when the inhabitants were confronted with
    overwhelming danger, and that accord was purchased at great cost.
  </p>
  <p>
    People here revere the Earthmother, an embodiment of nature. The Earthmother reveals her power
    at moonwells, the sacred springs of natural magic found on the larger Moonshaes. Druids tend the
    moonwells, assisted by bards, rangers, and other heroes with a connection to nature or fey
    magic. The heart of the Earthmother’s power lies in Myrloch Vale at the center of the island of
    Gwynneth, the most magical place in the Moonshaes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kendrick dynasty ruled the isles without rival until High King Derid Kendrick’s reign, when
    two foreign powers invaded. The archfey High Lady Ordalf arrived from the Feywild and claimed
    Gwynneth; the fey that dwelled there became her subjects. At the same time, the nation of Amn
    swept into the Moonshaes, laying claim to the realm’s valuable natural resources. The
    simultaneous invasions shattered Derid’s authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tragedy struck when Derid’s son, Owaren, was imprisoned by Amn and later died during an escape
    attempt. High Lady Ordalf sympathized with Derid’s grief, imagining the loss of her own son,
    Prince Araithe. The two nobles allied together against Amn. After the war, Prince Araithe
    married Derid’s daughter, Tarilyn. Their daughter, Caitlyn Kendrick, is the heir of both high
    king and high lady. For many, the hope of a united Moonshaes rests on her.

  As the first settlers of the Moonshaes, giants established the kingdom of Ostoria. Elves followed
  long after Ostoria’s collapse, inviting creatures from the Feywild to join them. Eventually
  humans, dwarves, and others followed suit. Of the varied cultures that now call these islands
  home, the most prominent are the Ffolk, Norlanders, fey, and giants.

  mutual defense. Ffolk navigate the isles in sturdy vessels built for fishing and hauling cargo.

<p data-content-chunk-id="bebfe320-36c2-417d-85ae-c168443dfa8f">
  The Kendrick family is Ffolk and has ruled the Moonshaes for over a century. Lesser noble families
  hold land on Alaron, Gwynneth, Moray, and Snowdown. Because these knights and barons each control
  only a small castle and a nearby town or village, petty feuds over land rights and old grudges
  occur regularly. High King Kendrick tries to keep his lords in line through a system of financial
  rewards, tax penalties, and land grants.

  Norlander culture was born on the island of Ruathym, hundreds of miles north of the Moonshaes.
  Settlers reached the Moonshaes centuries ago, making homes on Norland, Oman’s Isle, and many
  smaller islands. Norlander longships are feared along the Sword Coast for their speed and their
  crews’ reputation for sudden, bloodthirsty raids.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c62049c-f0b0-4143-9323-5a5ac3d92f4b">
  Norlanders revere a bold and cunning hero-god named Valkur whose exploits include slaying
  monsters, winning fantastic treasures, and performing feats of physical prowess. Valkur was also a
  good father and husband, a wise and generous ruler, and a protector of his people. Norlanders
  admire these traits, but they have a cynical view of life and human nature. They believe the world
  is tragic and that all good things are temporary. Norlanders know every great hall will one day go
  up in flames and every hero will die, but they laugh in the face of fate and live well so they’ll
  be remembered long past their deaths.

  Ffolk and Norlanders warred with each other for over a century before the two cultures united
  under the Kendrick dynasty. Ffolk learned of Norlanders’ generosity, love of life, and boldness,
  while Norlanders learned to appreciate the Ffolk values of hard work and determination. The two
  cultures shared agricultural and industrial strengths, including Ffolk animal husbandry and
  Norlander shipbuilding. While the Ffolk and Norlanders retain their own cultural
  identities—including manners of dress, cuisine, and musical tastes—the Ffolk and Norlanders often
  view themselves as a singular people, particularly in places where the two cultures intermingle
  most, such as on Alaron.

  When elves settled on the island of Gwynneth, they brought eladrin from the Feywild with them.
  Other fey followed until centaurs, pixies, satyrs, sprites, hags, and other creatures spread
  throughout the Moonshaes. The elves of the Moonshaes call themselves Llewyr. They resemble high
  elves in appearance but otherwise have the characteristics of wood elves and revere

  as Ffolk do. The elven realm gradually shrank over a millennia, and now only the hidden city of
  Chrysalis remains. Throughout the fading of the Llewyr society, the fey of the Moonshaes went
  ungoverned, answering only to their own archfey rulers.

  Decades ago, an archfey named High Lady Ordalf came to the Moonshaes as part of an ancient
  prophecy that foretold the arrival of a mysterious curse that only she could cure—at the cost of
  her own life. She brought a city of eladrin with her to Myrloch Vale through the power of a mythal

  lands. But enemies from the Feywild followed Ordalf and sank Karador beneath the great lake called
  Myrloch. She retreated to the great forest, now all that remains of Sarifal.

  Instead, they navigate the islands through supernatural paths known as fairy trods. (See “Magic of
  the Moonshaes” below for more on fairy trods.)

  The Colossal Kingdom of Ostoria was born, ascended to greatness, and faded a millennia before the
  first elf set sail for the Moonshaes. Giants constructed homes in picturesque locations throughout
  the isles and topped the tallest peaks with fantastic castles. They brought ettins, trolls, ogres,
  dire wolves, winter wolves, and other monsters to the isles.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="890e08a4-d8a3-44cc-b75f-6431d913c268">
  But giants’ influence gradually faded. One by one, they abandoned most of their homes and castles.
  Llewyr, Ffolk, and Norlander settlers later repurposed the towering blocks used in these abandoned
  structures for walls and doors into everything from throne rooms to ritual sites.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d20b583-7b77-4276-b4fc-2ca2c001ecf2">
  But although giants’ numbers have diminished, they live on every major island in the Moonshaes.
  Ffolk fear them, sharing fables about hungry giants able to smell Ffolk from miles away. Norlander
  heroes, however, sneak into giant steadings and steal golden trinkets. The giants meet these
  invasions either with violence or a weary sigh, depending on the giant whose goods were stolen.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b72cf74a-f2eb-41f0-8be1-f7838936d6d8">
  Firbolgs act as ambassadors between giants and the Llewyr, fey, and druids of the Ffolk, while
  goliaths represent giant interests among merchants, crafters, and the Norlanders. Peaceful giants
  respect their firbolg and goliath allies, giving them places of honor and allowing them to govern
  themselves. However, fire, frost, and hill giants would rather subjugate their minions and rule by
  force. Goliaths and firbolg in such cruel situations cooperate with nearby settlements to escape.

  The Moonshae Isles are steeped in magic. Druids wield the primal magic of the Earthmother,

  The Earthmother is the divine embodiment of the Moonshae Isles and its inhabitants. When life on
  the islands flourish, the Earthmother thrives. Her chief servants and priests are druids, but she
  is revered by Ffolk, Norlanders, elves, and fey alike. Druids taught local bards the secrets of
  the College of the Moon, and the druids are protected by everyone who wields nature magic or
  understands the fey. Every village has an elder respected for their understanding of the
  Earthmother.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fb4c451-3127-489f-a9c4-b465908c3447">
  The Earthmother has no churches or temples. Her devotees perform rites at moonwells, sacred
  springs ringed by standing stones and glowing with white light. Every moonwell is a direct
  connection to the Earthmother. The discovery of a new moonwell is an exceptionally holy event—a
  reassuring sign of the Earthmother’s strength.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8081f63-04c2-4253-b10c-1982cf04128f">
  Environmental destruction, pollution, and the plundering of natural resources harm the
  Earthmother. The Rusting is a sign of this kind of harm and causes her constant suffering. The
  Rusting has already corrupted some moonwells, which the Earthmother feels as bleeding wounds.

  Lycanthropes, violent humanoids, and evil fey in the Moonshaes worship Malar in an aspect called
  Kazgaroth, or simply “the Beast.” Kazgaroth has manifested and been defeated multiple times. His
  natural form is a monstrous, demonic tyrannosaurus rex, but he is a shape-shifter who has adopted
  the form of everything from a dryad to Thelgaar Ironhand, the former king of Oman’s Isle. The last
  time Kazgaroth appeared, he was defeated by the Kendrick family and their allies. This led to
  Tristan Kendrick’s ascension as high king and the founding of the Kendrick dynasty.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d2315c6-c7da-4fea-a580-05870ed7b794">
  Kazgaroth’s most powerful followers are two tribes of evil lycanthropes collectively called the
  Red Shadow, based on the island of Moray. Members of the Red Shadow leave their deep forest
  dwellings to attack civilians at every opportunity, murdering all but one captive, whom they bring
  back to a moonwell for sacrifice. Kazgaroth’s servants believe that if they sacrifice enough
  people to the moonwells, they can resurrect the Beast. Kazgaroth’s cult extends to settlements
  throughout the Moonshaes; members of the cult gather information for the Red Shadow and spread
  their shape-shifting curse in secret.

  Fairy trods are magical pathways that lead through wilderness and connect islands together.
  Travelers on a fairy trod quickly reach their destination regardless of distance or terrain. Every
  fairy trod has a guardian, typically a dangerous fey. Guardians allow other fey to use the trod
  freely, but Humanoids must pass a test of the guardian’s devising. See “<a

  Wandering Isles
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="900b8724-f433-4d96-be7d-a0435b6ceeac">
  Smaller Moonshae Isles that move are called wandering isles, and the precise details of their
  magical movement vary. In some cases, the island simply glides along with the current. Such
  islands move in a vaguely circular pattern that repeats over a period of years or decades.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="23dbb302-f195-46e9-b041-ab12219e7784">
  Other islands vanish and reappear. Most reappear instantly in a far-off location, but islands can
  disappear for days, weeks, or years. Some of these vanishing islands go to the Feywild, and others
  sink beneath the waves. These disappearing islands can reappear anywhere, or they might cycle
  between recurring locations.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9384c292-27b7-46d3-9908-06a639709dcb">
  Because of these unusual properties, islands in the Moonshaes have unpredictable inhabitants and
  strange landmarks. A wandering isle might pick up fey creatures from the Feywild, travelers from
  elsewhere in Faerûn, or multiversal explorers. Wandering isles remain part of

  The Rusting
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f38c63d-9c06-46a6-928e-64c198fd4237">
  The Rusting is a supernatural curse and contagion created by the dying words of Lady Erliza
  Daressin, Amn’s former vampire governor of Snowdown. Those afflicted with the Rusting are
  compelled by the curse to perpetuate environmental destruction much as Amn did on Snowdown,
  threatening the Moonshaes and

  herself.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee725a67-3b33-42f4-8abb-0748407dc052">
  The Rusting typically appears where the Earthmother is harmed by pollution or the exploitation of
  natural resources, such as on Snowdown, where Amn dug open mining pits, cut down forests, and
  redirected waterways into pollution-filled swamps. For example, overfishing in the Bay of Norland
  brought the Rusting to Norland. Undead and Aberrations, especially fomorians, are common where the
  Rusting appears, but their connection to the curse is unclear.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ed70435a-545d-4885-82f8-92efa842b31e">
  The Rusting withdraws if the environmental damage that prompted it is addressed, but this is made
  more difficult by the curse itself. In addition, some individuals seek out the curse, considering
  the Rusting a path to strength, power, and extended life. These [monsters]Rusted[/monsters]
  intentionally cause environmental damage to spread the curse. The leader of these individuals is
  the self-proclaimed [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters] (see

  The Rusting manifests as a thin, iron coating that grows over a victim’s body. When exposed to
  moisture, this iron skin corrodes into a rust-colored plaque. As the Rusting covers the victim,

  <strong><em>Fighting the Contagion.</em></strong> Daily at dawn, an afflicted creature makes a DC

  While using a fairy trod, characters feel like they are traveling through an ordinary path in the
  wilderness, but the journey takes less time and ignores impassable terrain such as water and
  mountains. Travel time along fairy trods can vary, but typically 1 minute of travel on a fairy
  trod is equivalent to 1 hour of travel elsewhere. After the requisite amount of time spent
  traveling, the party arrives at their destination. Characters can pause along the trod and camp
  there safely, but leaving the trod before reaching the destination causes them to emerge at a
  random point in the Moonshae Isles.

</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c5e15769-7581-4293-ab3c-a59b0feada98">
  The largest isle of the Moonshaes, Alaron stretches 250 miles north to south but only 40 miles
  across at its middle. Norlanders settled in the mountainous northern half of the island and
  founded the realm of Gnarhelm while Ffolk made their home in the forested and fertile south. These
  two peoples saw each other first as enemies, then as rivals, then as family.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79e951e9-550c-4d55-9992-f73106b69df8">
  Northern Alaron is swept by vicious storms and has little agricultural land. Nevertheless,
  Norlanders can eke out a living working long months at sea. Meanwhile, Ffolk in the south have
  grown so prosperous their minor lords regularly skirmish over rights to forests and farmland.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10acf680-45f3-4d89-a45b-fb7b08be137e">
  The commonalities between Ffolk and Norlanders are on full display on Alaron, where these two
  cultures intermingle freely. Norlanders and Ffolk are proud warriors, valuing boldness and the
  keeping of oaths. The Norlander love of the sea is mirrored by the Ffolk respect for the land.
  Most citizens of Alaron claim both Norlander and Ffolk kin.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6074d88-7c8d-4489-b5c9-5ef3aa68a78d">
  High King Cymrych Hugh brought Norlanders and Ffolk together a thousand years ago, building an
  alliance that included dwarves and elves. Now the Ffolk Kendrick family rules the isles, and the
  Norlander jarl of Gnarhelm answers to High King Derid Kendrick.

  The seat of High King Kendrick’s power, Caer Calidyrr is the center of trade and diplomacy in the
  Moonshaes. Properly speaking, the name “Caer Calidyrr” applies only to the ancient castle that
  overlooks the city of Calidyrr. This sprawling fortress was raised by Cymrych Hugh, first high
  king of the Isles, and includes abandoned underground levels.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="181128eb-17f6-4d2c-a563-a81aceb4b85c">
  Now in his sixties, High King Kendrick has learned from the misfortunes of his youth and has
  become a consensus builder with a keen eye for detecting deception. He is a member of the Lords’
  Alliance and a patron to its agents. When not keeping court, he travels south to Caer Corwell to
  visit his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter.

  Ffolk and Norlanders mingle on the busy wharves of the city, where traders from the Sword Coast
  unload weapons, armor, a dizzying array of alcoholic beverages, and rare magical components
  collected across Faerûn. Meanwhile, Moonshae merchants sell everything from fish and lumber to
  jewelry and ambergris. The rough-and-tumble mix of sailors, merchants, and soldiers makes the city
  dangerous after dark, especially near the docks. Zhentarim money has opened many doors and now
  funds a warehouse that serves as a foothold for Zhentarim activity in the Moonshaes.

  Kythyss—a village infamous for smugglers, thieves, and bloodthirsty mercenaries—the road cuts
  through the lush farmlands of Bregonshire and the county of Stirgewick. It also provides the
  safest route through Dernall Forest. From Caer Calidyrr, the road branches west to Blackstone and
  north to White Rock. It is the high king’s responsibility to keep the road safe. But the road is

  Cymrych Hugh, where the first high king of the Isles was buried. Cymrych Hugh possessed fabulous
  treasures that became symbols of his rule, including a crown fashioned by dwarves, a silver sword
  forged by elves, and a ring given to him by his wife, Allisynn. The crown and sword were later
  recovered by the Kendricks and became royal heirlooms, but the ring has never resurfaced; many
  believe it to still be around Cymrych’s finger. Other moonwells are located in Rushdown Wood, in
  Torriage Wood, and tucked into the northwest corner of the Dernall Forest.

  numerous here and maintain their own realm in the forest of Sarifal. Following the retreat of High
  Lady Ordalf’s incursion, Norlander families are returning to reclaim homesteads in the mountainous
  north, and the Kendrick family has rebuilt their old castle Caer Corwell. Elves maintain the
  hidden city of Chrysalis in the mountains, and Rustfire dwarves (whose ancestral name has nothing
  to do with the Rusting curse) dwell in the mountains northeast of Myrloch. Most Gwynneth
  settlements are built on the ruins of ancient elven communities that date back more than ten
  thousand years.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="502eb2aa-c48f-403d-82d5-9306d55a72c9">
  The fierce storms that plague the rest of the Moonshaes are less frequent on Gwynneth, though rain
  is common and leaves all it touches fresh and sweet smelling. Indeed, everything on Gwynneth
  carries a little enchantment. The mountains rise with stark majesty, and the forests loom deep and
  mysterious. The fabled Myrloch Vale stands at the center of this magic.

  brought merchants and crafters aplenty, and the settlements of southern Gwynneth are thriving for

  Snowdown’s history is rife with sorrow and devastation. Located on the south end of the Moonshaes,
  Snowdown was protected from harsh weather by Gwynneth in the west and was once the most temperate
  and fertile of the isles. Ffolk dwelled there on quiet and peaceful farms. They left the rest of
  the violent Moonshaes alone and expected to be left alone in return.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="edf79231-a826-4475-b879-5980f4338094">
  During the Amn invasion a century ago, the enigmatic and cruel vampire Erliza Daressin took over
  the island. Amn soldiers plundered Snowdown’s rich natural resources, stripping mines bare and
  chopping down forests. Waterways were redirected into open mines or other industrial projects,
  creating toxic ponds. The invaders crushed local resistance with impunity. Then Erliza headed off
  retaliation from High King Derid Kendrick by abducting his only son, Owaren.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="940fc0b2-262a-416f-aa3c-bb1da6f793ef">
  Owaren died trying to escape, a tragedy that united High King Kendrick and High Lady Ordalf.
  Derid’s daughter, Tarilyn Kendrick, and Ordalf’s son, Prince Araithe, led a united army against
  Caer Westphal, and Tarilyn’s magic permanently destroyed Erliza. However, the vampire’s dying
  words became a curse that plagues the Moonshae Isles to this day.

  The Rusting first manifested at Snowdown’s only moonwell, located near the center of the island.
  Amn mercenaries had chased off the moonwell’s druid. Without its protectors, the waters of this
  moonwell turned to a slick, glistening oil, its surrounding stones withered to rust, and the trees
  of its grove whitened and died. Meanwhile, attempts to rein in the environmental destruction
  caused by Amn have ended in disaster. When a dam blocking the Harloch was demolished, a crushing
  wave of floodwaters mixed with open mines, reducing southern Snowdown to a putrid swamp.

  Decades after Erliza’s defeat and the withdrawal of Amn, Snowdown is a blight on the Moonshaes. A
  few small settlements struggle on, but sickness and famine shrink the population year after year.
  Ffolk brave droves of Aberrations and Undead within the unstable tunnels of the highland mines in

  Sometimes the natural currents around Ruathym, Whalebones, and the Moonshaes combine and create a
  whirlpool strong enough to draw in ships. Ships caught in its currents are torn apart and their
  wreckage drifts to the ocean floor three thousand feet below, where it is picked clean by
  [monsters]Giant Crab;Giant Crabs[/monsters].

  The storm giant stronghold called Maelstrom lies underneath the whirlpool. The undersea fortress
  of Serissa, queen of the giants, is carved into a reef. Four rocky towers covered in barnacles and
  coral reach upward, ringing a large sinkhole that descends into the heart of the fortress. (For
  more on Maelstrom and Queen Serissa, see <em>Storm King’s Thunder.</em> )

<p data-content-chunk-id="403d79d2-9ecb-4822-9c53-d1a90d1009a0">
  Norlander culture was born on the island of Ruathym, two hundred miles north of the Moonshaes.
  Seeking to escape the bleak and mountainous Ruathym, wracked by strong waves and bitter cold,
  Norlanders sent longships south and east, settling in both the Moonshaes and the old city of
  Illusk (now Luskan). While Norlanders of the Moonshaes have little reason to return to Ruathym,
  they still tell stories of their people’s grand exodus. [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters] uses
  the settlement of Ruathym as a safe harbor, selling plunder from her raids, buying supplies, and
  recruiting fresh crew.

  Whales have come to the small rocky islands east of Ruathym known as Whalebones for as long as
  Norlanders have chronicled their history. Rocs perch on the islands’ tallest peaks, and the
  islands’ fierce locals eagerly take food and supplies by force from anyone foolish enough to draw
  near.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a540d81-cf55-4910-a746-bd94de3b7889">
  Druids believe that the whales come here to honor and commune with their dead ancestors and have
  banned whale hunting near the islands. Unfortunately, overfishing elsewhere in the Moonshaes has
  drawn whalers to the Whalebones in a clear violation of tradition. Inhabitants of Whalebones have
  begun striking back at whaling ships to protect the pods.

  Adventures in the Moonshaes Isles often feature distinct themes such as fairy tale elements and
  eco-fantasy. The following section expounds on these themes and how to use them in your
  adventures.

  Adventures among the Fey
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da8b1b9a-ff54-486d-bb72-f30b89b59368">
  Fey are seldom far away in the Moonshae Isles, especially on Gwynneth and around Myrloch Vale.
  Bullywugs and goblins bedevil novice adventurers, while experienced heroes confront hags and
  displacer beasts. Any denizen of the Feywild might appear through a fey crossing—this includes
  non-Fey creatures such as dragons and unicorns, as well as mastiffs, wolves, and elk, which are
  popular animal companions there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b94a58d-d8ed-4675-8dcd-8a037a8299ae">
  A coven of hags makes an especially good recurring villain for a Moonshae Isles campaign, but you
  also might use a [monsters]Winter Eladrin[/monsters] (see

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab4938dc-05f4-4a18-8786-1c5c0800ee83">
  In fairy stories, characters often solve problems diplomatically rather than by fighting.
  Characters encounter fey with specific needs or desires—such as the guardian of a fairy trod—and
  if the characters bring the fey the thing they need, the fey lets them pass. An adventure location
  might be guarded by a fey knight who offers to duel challengers, but the knight might be won over
  by less combative means such as bringing him a fey steed or composing a ballad that glorifies his
  exploits. Evil fey can be thwarted this way as well; characters who steal the eye from a coven of
  hags might be able to trade it back to the hags in exchange for the hags’ cooperation. When you
  design fairy tale adventures, keep an open mind to nonviolent solutions proposed by your players,
  and consider challenges that can be overcome with skills, relationships, and roleplay.

  Sailing the Moonshaes

<p data-content-chunk-id="47e4564a-3fc1-48b9-aeab-1eba12fa3b8b">
  In the Moonshaes, you’re never more than a day’s travel from the water, and many locals know how
  to handle a boat. Moonshae stories often require the characters to sail to one or more islands.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3ebe594-3d53-4e2f-99c9-dbc28b5df972">
  Norlander adventures often focus on piracy, raiding, or whaling. Norlander longships raid coastal
  settlements and prey on passing ships, so pirates and raiders make great enemies for your
  characters. You can use Humanoid creatures in the

  such as guards, scouts, berserkers, priests of Tempus, and, of course, pirates for Norlander
  raiders. They might bring animals or other monstrous companions with them on raids, such as
  [monsters]Winter Wolf;Winter Wolves[/monsters] or a pet [monsters]Owlbear[/monsters]. After the
  characters fight off a raid, they might follow the raiders back to their home and negotiate with
  (or threaten) their leader to end the attacks.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06c0f085-3a20-4007-ad93-96c235c85bad">
  Whaling has been part of Norland culture for centuries, and many Norland families depend on whales
  for survival. Whaling is an extraordinarily dangerous task that could make for exciting
  adventures. A successful hunt can yield meat for a village of hungry Norlanders and lucrative
  byproducts like ambergris and whalebone. But sometimes the “whale” turns out to be a
  [monsters]Dragon Turtle[/monsters] or an [monsters]Ancient Sea Serpent[/monsters] (see

  Seafaring adventures can also center around trade and exploration. In these stories, merchants
  hire characters to escort them through dangerous waters. The characters or one of their NPC allies
  might have their own ship. The party can discover undersea settlements and meet D&amp;D’s vast
  array of underwater creatures, including vicious [monsters]Kuo-Toa;kuo-toa[/monsters],

  The Earthmother is a divine embodiment of the Moonshae Islands, and the Rusting is a supernatural
  curse that embodies environmental destruction, exploitation, and pollution. This makes the
  Moonshaes an excellent place to explore stories of eco-fantasy, in which heroic characters protect
  nature while addressing ecological disasters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cf7898d3-49b9-4109-a0f6-80307eaa6491">
  Druids, Rangers, and other characters with a connection to nature or the fey are often drawn into
  eco-fantasy adventures, but other characters might have a role as outsiders learning the
  importance of living things and the environment.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4fbfe6d7-b085-4a86-99a9-7b1b5d7007c9">
  People living in the Moonshaes sometimes cause environmental damage as a consequence of
  industrialization or overpopulation. Overfishing, cutting down forests, and draining wetlands are
  examples. In these stories, solving the problem often requires creative solutions and negotiation.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa4ea785-3f7c-4d64-9f82-5af81e3e8ede">
  The allegorical nature of eco-fantasy can also lend itself to stories of Aberrations, Undead, and
  [monsters]Rusted[/monsters] creatures causing environmental destruction by design, not by
  accident. These adventures threaten the ecology of the Moonshaes and, by extension,

  Norlanders and Ffolk warred for generations before coming together and forging a united Moonshaes.
  This motif—longtime enemies finding shared purpose—recurs in Moonshae Isles adventures.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="213a13a1-7414-45a7-b0f5-92f1d0ae34f1">
  Relations between the fey of Sarifal and the humanoid inhabitants of the isles demonstrate this
  motif again. High Lady Ordalf brought thousands of fey to Myrloch Vale in defiance of the high
  king, driving the Kendrick family out of their ancestral home. But the two sides united after the
  death of Owaren Kendrick.

<p data-content-chunk-id="2281acdf-81a3-4dd3-92a3-75b901556756">
  Tensions between ancient enemies in the Moonshaes persist to this day. Orcs and dwarves fight
  beneath the mountains of Alaron. Giants have returned to Oman’s Isle, driving out Norlanders and
  Ffolk alike. Good and evil fey quarrel according to ancient rules. Negotiating with these groups
  isn’t easy. If the disparate groups in the Moonshaes are to live together in peace, heroic
  characters must help them find common ground.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b40f46c4-445c-463f-ad97-203a52af1e85">
  The adventure “Message in a Bottle” provides a map and a way for characters to gain a Bastion on
  one of the Moonshae’s wandering isles. The island moves around, taking the characters to new
  adventures of your creation. At first, the characters might be subject to the whims of the
  island’s magic, but as they grow in power, they might learn to control its travel.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03783af5-9b0b-4fa0-9391-f7989053de5f">
  The castle detailed on the map represents the party’s combined Bastion. As characters gain in
  level, they can add to this structure or discover hidden underground levels. Perhaps there are
  other structures on the island that the characters can renovate and add to their Bastion.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e11d68a-e5bd-475c-93ed-ab3eb178d461">
  A Moonshae Bastion might have Fey hirelings such as a goblin cook, blink dog guards, a pixie
  librarian, and a bullywug gardener. Characters who ally with Norlanders might recruit them as
  sailors and soldiers. Giants might send goliaths and firbolg to be their representatives at the
  Bastion. A druid might leave their position at a moonwell to staff one of the Bastion’s
  facilities.
