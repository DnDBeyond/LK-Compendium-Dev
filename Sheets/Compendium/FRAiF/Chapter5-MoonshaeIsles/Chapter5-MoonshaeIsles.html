    <p class="fraif-dropcap">The Moonshae Isles are realms of ancient magic, fierce storms, and bold heroes, where druids safeguard the land and fey lurk in every forest glen. The Moonshaes include seven major islands and over a hundred smaller ones, and a variety of cultures call these isles home. The story of the Moonshaes tells of peoples coming together to protect their homes, their family, and the sacred earth. Tragically, this unity came about only when the inhabitants were confronted with overwhelming danger, and that accord was purchased at great cost.</p>
    <p>People here revere the Earthmother, an embodiment of nature. The Earthmother reveals her power at moonwells, the sacred springs of natural magic found on the larger Moonshaes. Druids tend the moonwells, assisted by bards, rangers, and other heroes with a connection to nature or fey magic. The heart of the Earthmother’s power lies in Myrloch Vale at the center of the island of Gwynneth, the most magical place in the Moonshaes.</p>
    <p>The Kendrick dynasty ruled the isles without rival until High King Derid Kendrick’s reign, when two foreign powers invaded. The archfey High Lady Ordalf arrived from the Feywild and claimed Gwynneth; the fey that dwelled there became her subjects. At the same time, the nation of Amn swept into the Moonshaes, laying claim to the realm’s valuable natural resources. The simultaneous invasions shattered Derid’s authority.</p>
    <p>Tragedy struck when Derid’s son, Owaren, was imprisoned by Amn and later died during an escape attempt. High Lady Ordalf sympathized with Derid’s grief, imagining the loss of her own son, Prince Araithe. The two nobles allied together against Amn. After the war, Prince Araithe married Derid’s daughter, Tarilyn. Their daughter, Caitlyn Kendrick, is the heir of both high king and high lady. For many, the hope of a united Moonshaes rests on her.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="918bb85e-41c0-4d0c-a823-61aac7e85936">The heroes of these tales are known for their wit and charm rather than their fighting skill, making these adventures perfect for young players or those who enjoy solving problems through roleplay, humor, and guile.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b1241efc-ed95-4ba9-b92b-9d57426cd346">The sea surrounding the Moonshaes provides endless adventure in a challenging environment. Battles with pirates, bold raids ashore, and the hunting of fabulous sea beasts are made more perilous by harsh weather and the threat of drowning. Beneath the waves, heroes can encounter everything from sahuagin to storm giants.</p>

She understands she’s expected to unite the Moonshaes and lead the nation. While she loves her two families and the Moonshaes, she resents that she has no say in her own destiny. This resentment manifests when Caitlyn disobeys her parents, shirks responsibility, and revels with fey pranksters instead of attending court.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2dae34d2-2466-47b5-af5d-9a14c1ca6594">As the first settlers of the Moonshaes, giants established the kingdom of Ostoria. Elves followed long after Ostoria’s collapse, inviting creatures from the Feywild to join them. Eventually humans, dwarves, and others followed suit. Of the varied cultures that now call these islands home, the most prominent are the Ffolk, Norlanders, fey, and giants.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FfolkandNorlanders" data-content-chunk-id="cc48af43-05f9-45ae-bb89-3d97b80168eb"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#FfolkandNorlanders" data-content-chunk-id="35fbdf2e-a576-4be2-9c8a-e4311f415485"> </a> Ffolk and Norlanders</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d86ef29-5e28-42f2-b474-5edf67228bb3">The two preeminent human cultures in the Moonshae Isles are Ffolk and Norlanders. Despite past wars between the two sides, Ffolk and Norlanders now coexist peacefully across the Moonshaes.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Ffolk" data-content-chunk-id="c296966a-d52f-4693-9ac9-10a61e1b8f67"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Ffolk" data-content-chunk-id="84c12ed9-7723-4c1d-8d2e-038f346d204d"> </a> Ffolk</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b489960-ee67-4dc7-9042-8e40ff5d7a7e">The humans of the southern Moonshae islands call themselves Ffolk. A peaceful but proud people, they show their respect for the land through their worship of <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="984ce626-dd16-4d61-85fd-eb5b2e57d2db">the Earthmother</a> , a nature god. Industrious and curious, Ffolk value laws, hard work, and education. They farm, herd sheep and hunt in the lowlands, and they form craft guilds, law courts, and militias for mutual defense. Ffolk navigate the isles in sturdy vessels built for fishing and hauling cargo.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c7f07608-109e-4103-91c7-4157e5a25d46">The Kendrick family is Ffolk and has ruled the Moonshaes for over a century. Lesser noble families hold land on Alaron, Gwynneth, Moray, and Snowdown. Because these knights and barons each control only a small castle and a nearby town or village, petty feuds over land rights and old grudges occur regularly. High King Kendrick tries to keep his lords in line through a system of financial rewards, tax penalties, and land grants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9c180c4d-d4a8-46da-9ab3-7bffb5166960">The Ffolk perform rites to placate the local fey: leaving pails of milk on the back porch, hanging bells around their homes, or reciting rhymes that name and flatter the fey while politely asking them to leave. The people of Waterdeep and <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/baldurs-gate" data-content-chunk-id="88351cfc-211b-4829-a342-ff0f5de630a8">Baldur’s Gate</a> dismiss these practices as quaint superstition, but these traditions have allowed the Ffolk to coexist with fey.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Norlanders" data-content-chunk-id="683f3970-ff43-48fd-9059-376ff70bb0fc"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Norlanders" data-content-chunk-id="e5c48adc-8981-489e-9771-2c3923b892bd"> </a> Norlanders</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cba4d0e5-bcfc-42ef-80ff-10812bccbed6">Norlander culture was born on the island of Ruathym, hundreds of miles north of the Moonshaes. Settlers reached the Moonshaes centuries ago, making homes on Norland, Oman’s Isle, and many smaller islands. Norlander longships are feared along the Sword Coast for their speed and their crews’ reputation for sudden, bloodthirsty raids.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4ad4c84-1c48-453c-b497-ef58d7ae714d">Norlanders revere a bold and cunning hero-god named Valkur whose exploits include slaying monsters, winning fantastic treasures, and performing feats of physical prowess. Valkur was also a good father and husband, a wise and generous ruler, and a protector of his people. Norlanders admire these traits, but they have a cynical view of life and human nature. They believe the world is tragic and that all good things are temporary. Norlanders know every great hall will one day go up in flames and every hero will die, but they laugh in the face of fate and live well so they’ll be remembered long past their deaths.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="668b7b33-443b-470f-9a87-4638c349494f">Norlanders in the Moonshaes have rulers known as jarls, typically one to each island. These jarls have sworn oaths of loyalty to High King Kendrick.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AUnifiedPeople" data-content-chunk-id="2b87368d-66eb-4d59-bb79-2b85f417617b"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#AUnifiedPeople" data-content-chunk-id="08316856-bf53-4e82-b39a-89c00dc5bca0"> </a> A Unified People</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c35f1118-775c-4284-9ebf-cba138f515ca">Ffolk and Norlanders warred with each other for over a century before the two cultures united under the Kendrick dynasty. Ffolk learned of Norlanders’ generosity, love of life, and boldness, while Norlanders learned to appreciate the Ffolk values of hard work and determination. The two cultures shared agricultural and industrial strengths, including Ffolk animal husbandry and Norlander shipbuilding. While the Ffolk and Norlanders retain their own cultural identities—including manners of dress, cuisine, and musical tastes—the Ffolk and Norlanders often view themselves as a singular people, particularly in places where the two cultures intermingle most, such as on Alaron.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FeyandLlewyr" data-content-chunk-id="c7d44f71-89f5-42f4-b368-f3e423c61fd7"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#FeyandLlewyr" data-content-chunk-id="3fb08005-7a3e-483c-b61b-0872963d615b"> </a> Fey and Llewyr</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9b6618a-0620-4c90-ac9c-51487dfb1649">When elves settled on the island of Gwynneth, they brought eladrin from the Feywild with them. Other fey followed until centaurs, pixies, satyrs, sprites, hags, and other creatures spread throughout the Moonshaes. The elves of the Moonshaes call themselves Llewyr. They resemble high elves in appearance but otherwise have the characteristics of wood elves and revere <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="0bfcef03-ced1-4162-bc01-7220237e5637">the Earthmother</a> as Ffolk do. The elven realm gradually shrank over a millennia, and now only the hidden city of Chrysalis remains. Throughout the fading of the Llewyr society, the fey of the Moonshaes went ungoverned, answering only to their own archfey rulers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0bf0b4b5-b583-4fa9-b259-e464d170f95d">Decades ago, an archfey named High Lady Ordalf came to the Moonshaes as part of an ancient prophecy that foretold the arrival of a mysterious curse that only she could cure—at the cost of her own life. She brought a city of eladrin with her to Myrloch Vale through the power of a mythal (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/frhof" data-content-chunk-id="422f6f6e-3a58-4a30-a89d-64a90245842a">Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</a> for more on mythals), naming the city Karador and founding the realm of Sarifal in the surrounding lands. But enemies from the Feywild followed Ordalf and sank Karador beneath the great lake called Myrloch. She retreated to the great forest, now all that remains of Sarifal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a0bfd71-e9cc-45b4-a879-701a89b700ea">The eladrin of Sarifal call themselves shay. They specialize in circle magic and high magic (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/frhof" data-content-chunk-id="cc28377f-5a0d-4de8-a0a4-141b923290f5">Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</a> for more on these topics). Unlike other inhabitants of the Moonshaes, the fey are poor sailors. Instead, they navigate the islands through supernatural paths known as fairy trods. (See “Magic of the Moonshaes” below for more on fairy trods.)</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Giants" data-content-chunk-id="8d3216c2-8945-4c70-a9cc-c7a2894a0ee8"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Giants" data-content-chunk-id="8af2a26d-8171-4cc4-bd6b-3ad3670180fe"> </a> Giants</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fb6fdbb-9064-4b2d-a2e4-1620f13866c4">The Colossal Kingdom of Ostoria was born, ascended to greatness, and faded a millennia before the first elf set sail for the Moonshaes. Giants constructed homes in picturesque locations throughout the isles and topped the tallest peaks with fantastic castles. They brought ettins, trolls, ogres, dire wolves, winter wolves, and other monsters to the isles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="993fb81b-d582-4338-98f1-090243989597">But giants’ influence gradually faded. One by one, they abandoned most of their homes and castles. Llewyr, Ffolk, and Norlander settlers later repurposed the towering blocks used in these abandoned structures for walls and doors into everything from throne rooms to ritual sites.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49d4e699-f17c-4dfc-b1ad-a93c00324a47">But although giants’ numbers have diminished, they live on every major island in the Moonshaes. Ffolk fear them, sharing fables about hungry giants able to smell Ffolk from miles away. Norlander heroes, however, sneak into giant steadings and steal golden trinkets. The giants meet these invasions either with violence or a weary sigh, depending on the giant whose goods were stolen.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e777ae28-9cab-4964-aacd-4fa7bf523d8a">Firbolgs act as ambassadors between giants and the Llewyr, fey, and druids of the Ffolk, while goliaths represent giant interests among merchants, crafters, and the Norlanders. Peaceful giants respect their firbolg and goliath allies, giving them places of honor and allowing them to govern themselves. However, fire, frost, and hill giants would rather subjugate their minions and rule by force. Goliaths and firbolg in such cruel situations cooperate with nearby settlements to escape.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RecentThreats" data-content-chunk-id="25ddf570-a610-4d5b-9aee-e8b795e6bfee"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#RecentThreats" data-content-chunk-id="21fe9bc1-703b-4cf6-a07a-a300ccfb852d"> </a> Recent Threats</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b0d98e5-38cb-40f4-9fcb-377562807f66">Recently, a longship fleet of fire, frost, and hill giants sailed to Oman’s Isle from Maelstrom (see “Related Locations” below). They reclaimed their ancient steadings, driving out Ffolk and Norlander families.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b01c116-4c0f-4468-b0e8-6a5cb2edf7c4">Fomorians surface from the Underdark wherever the Rusting takes root. Many suspect a connection between fomorians and this strange curse.</p>
  <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MagicoftheMoonshaes" data-content-chunk-id="783f031a-f88c-4624-a0a6-a2ffbb011996"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#MagicoftheMoonshaes" data-content-chunk-id="935d63e9-0be9-47b9-a892-42f5ac25dad3"> </a> Magic of the Moonshaes</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26f6b315-402e-41fc-beba-08debd6b19c6">The Moonshae Isles are steeped in magic. Druids wield the primal magic of the Earthmother, opposing the bloodthirsty Cult of the Beast. Fey magic saturates the land, and islands can move or vanish overnight. Recently, an insidious supernatural curse has started slowly sweeping over the isles.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="de7265a7-0aab-4d97-94e7-69dd65e265ab"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="faebc511-fe45-4985-8798-c7aeace0b674"> </a> The Earthmother</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0bd520dc-891b-424f-b035-573d8918de3d">The Earthmother is the divine embodiment of the Moonshae Isles and its inhabitants. When life on the islands flourish, the Earthmother thrives. Her chief servants and priests are druids, but she is revered by Ffolk, Norlanders, elves, and fey alike. Druids taught local bards the secrets of the College of the Moon, and the druids are protected by everyone who wields nature magic or understands the fey. Every village has an elder respected for their understanding of the Earthmother.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86873db4-03f5-43a8-908a-1af2d776cf42">The Earthmother has no churches or temples. Her devotees perform rites at moonwells, sacred springs ringed by standing stones and glowing with white light. Every moonwell is a direct connection to the Earthmother. The discovery of a new moonwell is an exceptionally holy event—a reassuring sign of the Earthmother’s strength.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="359cf43e-b671-45cc-8ba9-e293f3b464a6">Environmental destruction, pollution, and the plundering of natural resources harm the Earthmother. The Rusting is a sign of this kind of harm and causes her constant suffering. The Rusting has already corrupted some moonwells, which the Earthmother feels as bleeding wounds.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CultoftheBeast" data-content-chunk-id="61608aef-1373-4fa5-8c0b-de4d31474cba"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CultoftheBeast" data-content-chunk-id="4409e529-4b1e-449f-b845-b68e4a486b10"> </a> Cult of the Beast</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="829a8bf1-e447-4948-a91b-170f818a2164">Lycanthropes, violent humanoids, and evil fey in the Moonshaes worship Malar in an aspect called Kazgaroth, or simply “the Beast.” Kazgaroth has manifested and been defeated multiple times. His natural form is a monstrous, demonic tyrannosaurus rex, but he is a shape-shifter who has adopted the form of everything from a dryad to Thelgaar Ironhand, the former king of Oman’s Isle. The last time Kazgaroth appeared, he was defeated by the Kendrick family and their allies. This led to Tristan Kendrick’s ascension as high king and the founding of the Kendrick dynasty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7cf406b6-5d4a-4b3c-96e1-fe538ba420e6">Kazgaroth’s most powerful followers are two tribes of evil lycanthropes collectively called the Red Shadow, based on the island of Moray. Members of the Red Shadow leave their deep forest dwellings to attack civilians at every opportunity, murdering all but one captive, whom they bring back to a moonwell for sacrifice. Kazgaroth’s servants believe that if they sacrifice enough people to the moonwells, they can resurrect the Beast. Kazgaroth’s cult extends to settlements throughout the Moonshaes; members of the cult gather information for the Red Shadow and spread their shape-shifting curse in secret.</p>

        <p data-content-chunk-id="e1b2d5ad-ff61-411e-a34c-16c9c6080f5b">Fey crossings—places where the Feywild touches the world—are common in the Moonshaes, especially on the isle of Gwynneth. Long ago, fey magic flowed out from these crossings and ran over the Moonshae Isles like imperceptible rivers. Fey magic is now so embedded in the land that it’s hard to tell where the magic of the Feywild ends and the primal magic of <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="889e152f-01d3-4144-832b-e7e356217383">the Earthmother</a> begins. The most famous manifestations of fey magic are hollow hills and fairy trods.</p>

        <p data-content-chunk-id="4a1413b4-737d-4517-9031-d6319e195bcc">A hollow hill is a small, low hill, typically with a single entrance framed by enormous stones. Anyone entering a hollow hill walks into a magnificent fairy palace. A hollow hill might be a fey crossing or a powerful magical effect that makes the space bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Time can pass strangely inside a hollow hill, so visitors who spend months or years there might emerge to find only a day has passed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="acafb3df-3971-4378-978f-fdd90c62a143">Fairy trods are magical pathways that lead through wilderness and connect islands together. Travelers on a fairy trod quickly reach their destination regardless of distance or terrain. Every fairy trod has a guardian, typically a dangerous fey. Guardians allow other fey to use the trod freely, but Humanoids must pass a test of the guardian’s devising. See “<a href="#UsingFairyTrods" data-content-chunk-id="a9586cb6-6850-4b09-8739-7be8dcdc6a2d">Using Fairy Trods</a> ” for more information.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b203d72d-2e29-48d9-862c-72649b438ea4">Smaller Moonshae Isles that move are called wandering isles, and the precise details of their magical movement vary. In some cases, the island simply glides along with the current. Such islands move in a vaguely circular pattern that repeats over a period of years or decades.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b4981ed-1241-4dfd-8256-4b9e6d6ba99e">Other islands vanish and reappear. Most reappear instantly in a far-off location, but islands can disappear for days, weeks, or years. Some of these vanishing islands go to the Feywild, and others sink beneath the waves. These disappearing islands can reappear anywhere, or they might cycle between recurring locations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8982c220-7153-4482-af14-520d4cdb4d9e">Because of these unusual properties, islands in the Moonshaes have unpredictable inhabitants and strange landmarks. A wandering isle might pick up fey creatures from the Feywild, travelers from elsewhere in Faerûn, or multiversal explorers. Wandering isles remain part of <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="f96801b6-b748-4ef1-b0ac-67d5d1d97adc">the Earthmother</a> , and druids who serve her believe she uses wandering isles to spy on distant realms and recruit potential allies.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheRusting" data-content-chunk-id="4c7ee259-2269-43a4-a583-8873b3b9ccfb"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#TheRusting" data-content-chunk-id="191b47a1-0771-46a9-bcdf-1d9ea3a4012d"> </a> The Rusting</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2313e76d-eb3b-4410-8af5-d43e664a6b5b">The Rusting is a supernatural curse and contagion created by the dying words of Lady Erliza Daressin, Amn’s former vampire governor of Snowdown. Those afflicted with the Rusting are compelled by the curse to perpetuate environmental destruction much as Amn did on Snowdown, threatening the Moonshaes and <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="6e6a157a-b362-40b1-a3c2-9ee188c0761d">the Earthmother</a> herself.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6cc79c9-38fb-4e95-bf24-528b92b54f2c">The Rusting typically appears where the Earthmother is harmed by pollution or the exploitation of natural resources, such as on Snowdown, where Amn dug open mining pits, cut down forests, and redirected waterways into pollution-filled swamps. For example, overfishing in the Bay of Norland brought the Rusting to Norland. Undead and Aberrations, especially fomorians, are common where the Rusting appears, but their connection to the curse is unclear.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e5bca87-980e-4f67-8268-5f7c10b6981a">The Rusting withdraws if the environmental damage that prompted it is addressed, but this is made more difficult by the curse itself. In addition, some individuals seek out the curse, considering the Rusting a path to strength, power, and extended life. These Rusted intentionally cause environmental damage to spread the curse. The leader of these individuals is the self-proclaimed [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters] (see <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary" data-content-chunk-id="8e79f63a-adf2-4da4-9572-eda725387a4e">chapter 9</a> ), who sails the Moonshae Isles as a vengeful pirate.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b7dd425a-d83f-4151-9649-55165d5c0eef"><em>Magical Contagion</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5f235c3-c3b7-4f20-b474-4d6ebb0e4957">The Rusting manifests as a thin, iron coating that grows over a victim’s body. When exposed to moisture, this iron skin corrodes into a rust-colored plaque. As the Rusting covers the victim, the victim eventually transforms into a type of creature known as a Rusted (see <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary" data-content-chunk-id="708f40e2-4e0a-4e6c-9830-14e1eb6fe43b">chapter 9</a> ).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c9ba296-9b21-4ae2-92e8-1fec74d8e2c0">Any creature that is wounded by a Rusted creature or spends 1 hour in an area where the Rusting has manifested makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Constructs and Undead automatically succeed on this save. On a failed save, the creature is afflicted by the Rusting and suffers the following effects:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b804df5d-9680-496b-9b81-a59cdc50ac6f"><strong>Curse.</strong> The creature gains 1 [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level and is cursed. While the creature is cursed, finishing a Long Rest doesn’t reduce the creature’s Exhaustion level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36af12ba-706e-4874-912d-02026e2f72be"><strong>Plated Joints.</strong> The creature’s Speed is reduced by 5 feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14bad3f9-8b15-42e4-a953-16e0ea91f1bf"><strong>Rusted Fate.</strong> When a cursed creature’s [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level reaches 6, it doesn’t die. Instead, the creature transforms into a Rusted version of its former self; its creature type becomes Construct, and it gains Immunity to Poison damage and the [condition]Exhaustion[/condition], [condition]Petrified[/condition], and [condition]Poisoned[/condition] conditions. The curse then ends for that creature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cf4ad904-1a42-49e0-b6fc-69ca9b3fbe46"><strong><em> Fighting the Contagion. </em></strong> Daily at dawn, an afflicted creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level as more iron coats its skin. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2333f57c-5755-430d-ad4f-d164600e7c8d">Removing the curse immediately ends the contagion for a creature.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e9c7dfd4-cced-4a6a-ab89-f590ac84bbf5">In the Moonshaes, getting from one island to another can be a challenge. While most Ffolk and Norlanders rely on boats and ships to sail the isles, adventurers might use other avenues, including magical pathways known as fairy trods.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fffb08a7-d760-4a43-8d16-5d4aeb36bba7">While using a fairy trod, characters feel like they are traveling through an ordinary path in the wilderness, but the journey takes less time and ignores impassable terrain such as water and mountains. Travel time along fairy trods can vary, but typically 1 minute of travel on a fairy trod is equivalent to 1 hour of travel elsewhere. After the requisite amount of time spent traveling, the party arrives at their destination. Characters can pause along the trod and camp there safely, but leaving the trod before reaching the destination causes them to emerge at a random point in the Moonshae Isles.</p>

<aside class="aside--gazetteer-overview">
    <p>This gazetteer provides overviews of the seven largest islands of the Moonshaes:</p>
    <ul class="list--hidden">
            <li><strong>Alaron.</strong> Home to the largest Ffolk populations and Caer Calidyrr, Alaron is the seat of High King Derid Kendrick.</li>
            <li><strong>Gwynneth.</strong> The most magical of the Moonshae Isles, Gwynneth’s power centers around Myrloch Vale and the fey kingdom of Sarifal.</li>
            <li><strong>Moray.</strong> An island overrun by werewolves and other monsters, Moray has become a refuge for evil.</li>
            <li><strong>Norland.</strong> The isle of Norland stands proud as the heart of Norlander culture in the Moonshaes.</li>
            <li><strong>Oman’s Isle.</strong> Once a symbol of Norlander power, giants and evil fey now rule this island.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowdown.</strong> Rich in mineral resources, Snowdown was briefly conquered by the nation of Amn.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More than a hundred smaller isles surround these seven. Some of these isles move or vanish altogether, slipping into the Feywild or other planes. This makes the Moonshaes best navigated by ship or, for the brave, by [magicitems]Windskiff[/magicitems] (see <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/magic-items">chapter 8</a> ).</p>

  <h3 class="compendium-hr location-banner heading-anchor" id="Alaron" data-content-chunk-id="f74ddf0e-cb4d-406a-badd-0e165c3477be"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Alaron" data-content-chunk-id="c37467b7-ae34-4260-b4ab-153dd068664e"> </a> Alaron</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54f9b865-16d6-436c-a4f9-7c0fc05678b4">The largest isle of the Moonshaes, Alaron stretches 250 miles north to south but only 40 miles across at its middle. Norlanders settled in the mountainous northern half of the island and founded the realm of Gnarhelm while Ffolk made their home in the forested and fertile south. These two peoples saw each other first as enemies, then as rivals, then as family.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f85c0e65-d4fc-4edd-850d-cd5b9d201d8e">Northern Alaron is swept by vicious storms and has little agricultural land. Nevertheless, Norlanders can eke out a living working long months at sea. Meanwhile, Ffolk in the south have grown so prosperous their minor lords regularly skirmish over rights to forests and farmland.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ad22898e-0ae2-48f2-95fb-3823fdb54ca4">The commonalities between Ffolk and Norlanders are on full display on Alaron, where these two cultures intermingle freely. Norlanders and Ffolk are proud warriors, valuing boldness and the keeping of oaths. The Norlander love of the sea is mirrored by the Ffolk respect for the land. Most citizens of Alaron claim both Norlander and Ffolk kin.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e59f19e-c1fc-4f78-af56-8a1f36430675">High King Cymrych Hugh brought Norlanders and Ffolk together a thousand years ago, building an alliance that included dwarves and elves. Now the Ffolk Kendrick family rules the isles, and the Norlander jarl of Gnarhelm answers to High King Derid Kendrick.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CaerCalidyrr" data-content-chunk-id="2db08294-b250-4ac7-8167-f159f1195c06"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CaerCalidyrr" data-content-chunk-id="0833c6ec-7407-405e-bef4-4508b4b38f55"> </a> Caer Calidyrr</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="346fa8fa-01dc-4dc7-bfe3-5658cf9f706f">The seat of High King Kendrick’s power, Caer Calidyrr is the center of trade and diplomacy in the Moonshaes. Properly speaking, the name “Caer Calidyrr” applies only to the ancient castle that overlooks the city of Calidyrr. This sprawling fortress was raised by Cymrych Hugh, first high king of the Isles, and includes abandoned underground levels.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9344ee0-2592-4c3f-a323-ca9962a083be">Now in his sixties, High King Kendrick has learned from the misfortunes of his youth and has become a consensus builder with a keen eye for detecting deception. He is a member of the Lords’ Alliance and a patron to its agents. When not keeping court, he travels south to Caer Corwell to visit his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a501dbdd-7388-4456-bd5e-c334106d3519">Ffolk and Norlanders mingle on the busy wharves of the city, where traders from the Sword Coast unload weapons, armor, a dizzying array of alcoholic beverages, and rare magical components collected across Faerûn. Meanwhile, Moonshae merchants sell everything from fish and lumber to jewelry and ambergris. The rough-and-tumble mix of sailors, merchants, and soldiers makes the city dangerous after dark, especially near the docks. Zhentarim money has opened many doors and now funds a warehouse that serves as a foothold for Zhentarim activity in the Moonshaes.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DernallForest" data-content-chunk-id="ba4b0fec-15b4-410b-b02b-5065573a26e9"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#DernallForest" data-content-chunk-id="3b4fe800-09bd-4018-b19f-921110d1976c"> </a> Dernall Forest</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1fac753d-e330-4231-9a0c-9182cef4ecb2">The largest forest in Alaron is home to violent gangs of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears that prey on hamlets within the forest, travelers, and each other, sometimes raiding farms in southern Alaron. Packs of [monsters]Worg;Worgs[/monsters] roam through these woods and cooperate with the goblins.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40d59094-dfcd-4fff-9311-b94104012007">The Swanmay River provides shelter to forest guardians known as [monsters]Swanmay;Swanmays[/monsters], fey with the ability to change into swans (see <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary" data-content-chunk-id="587e2ac0-375f-4bcb-b83d-01ee0205ea63">chapter 9</a> ). They seek heroic folk to help them restrain the goblins and restore harmony to the forest.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FairheightRange" data-content-chunk-id="89eff28b-d62b-4df6-a319-bbf63d3ebda5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#FairheightRange" data-content-chunk-id="14559c5c-1d44-4cf2-bbd5-7c08aa6a3e25"> </a> Fairheight Range</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c4f39f92-0a80-4158-b930-b3df65d8cf6a">These mountains, and the vast tunnel complexes that run under them, were claimed by dwarves and orcs long ago. The war between these two groups has been interrupted by swarms of Undead, trolls, and creatures from the Shadowfell, led by a mysterious [monsters]Shadow Dragon (Large);Shadow Dragon[/monsters].</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1271d928-bf1f-4846-800a-c700f6423c4c">The dwarves of Clan Rookoath have old ties to the high king, and the high king believes the only hope of victory is for Rookoath to ally with their traditional enemies, the Proudfury orcs, and confront the shadow dragon together. But so far his attempts to bring Rookoath and Proudfury representatives together have been fruitless, as the orcs consider him to be on the side of the dwarves.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Gnarhelm" data-content-chunk-id="b166badf-0b61-45a2-93be-0a127fd426d8"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Gnarhelm" data-content-chunk-id="0d734c4e-825c-426e-a7ec-8bafa33c7ca0"> </a> Gnarhelm</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce955e67-1f65-44e2-83b8-843ebb641258">The northern half of Alaron is governed by Jarl Scyld Sundersing (Medium [monsters]Warrior Veteran[/monsters]), a young human who respects the high king but is eager to establish his own heroic reputation in battle. The people of Gnarhelm work as miners, shepherds or goatherds, and mercenaries. They are fierce, heavily armored fighters who wield long axes, riding horses to battle but fighting on foot. Scyld keeps a personal guard of a hundred of these warriors and urges the high king to use them at every opportunity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="12e4705f-b405-4b4a-b707-aa016ac64489">An [monsters]Ancient Copper Dragon[/monsters] named Nymmurh lairs in a complex of twisting caves in the northern end of the Hardangheight mountains. Nymmurh is a patron of the Silmerhelve family in Waterdeep, leading him to spend time away from his lair. The Cult of the Dragon has found the lair and hopes to plunder its greatest treasures while Nymmurh is away, then ambush him on his return.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HighKingsRoad" data-content-chunk-id="5c18340f-dfe8-46c5-a3e6-c2b31d269735"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#HighKingsRoad" data-content-chunk-id="36a03304-97f0-4f97-9af8-abd6fb0e39c8"> </a> High King’s Road</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="633dbb10-7d09-4b71-9eed-672478baab71">The High King’s Road is the lifeblood of Alaron. Beginning at the southern tip of the island in Kythyss—a village infamous for smugglers, thieves, and bloodthirsty mercenaries—the road cuts through the lush farmlands of Bregonshire and the county of Stirgewick. It also provides the safest route through Dernall Forest. From Caer Calidyrr, the road branches west to Blackstone and north to White Rock. It is the high king’s responsibility to keep the road safe. But the road is long, and adventurers patrol the road, helping the king with everything from worgs of the forest to Zhentarim smugglers, and even the occasional border war between feuding nobles.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Moonwells" data-content-chunk-id="e2a6bbb4-482d-4c66-992f-ba2b31a1f8dd"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Moonwells" data-content-chunk-id="f28c2447-aad4-4155-bd94-9c155087a11f"> </a> Moonwells</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c74a00a-6e4f-4ae3-a049-54d769f04222">The Earthmother graces Alaron with several moonwells. The northernmost is near the cairn of Cymrych Hugh, where the first high king of the Isles was buried. Cymrych Hugh possessed fabulous treasures that became symbols of his rule, including a crown fashioned by dwarves, a silver sword forged by elves, and a ring given to him by his wife, Allisynn. The crown and sword were later recovered by the Kendricks and became royal heirlooms, but the ring has never resurfaced; many believe it to still be around Cymrych’s finger. Other moonwells are located in Rushdown Wood, in Torriage Wood, and tucked into the northwest corner of the Dernall Forest.</p>

  <h3 class="compendium-hr location-banner heading-anchor" id="Gwynneth" data-content-chunk-id="14588bc4-52ea-4f4b-a95e-8e0c5c55378b"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Gwynneth" data-content-chunk-id="7b4c221b-39bb-4cb6-b755-dbfd9e4007da"> </a> Gwynneth</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6507804d-a523-4146-9301-7dbbfe9a5e70">Gwynneth is the magical heart of the Moonshaes and the center of <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="44a2ebfa-ccf1-45f9-a4bd-20c2ecd19f21">the Earthmother</a> ’s power. The island holds more moonwells than the rest of the Moonshaes combined. Fey are numerous here and maintain their own realm in the forest of Sarifal. Following the retreat of High Lady Ordalf’s incursion, Norlander families are returning to reclaim homesteads in the mountainous north, and the Kendrick family has rebuilt their old castle Caer Corwell. Elves maintain the hidden city of Chrysalis in the mountains, and Rustfire dwarves (whose ancestral name has nothing to do with the Rusting curse) dwell in the mountains northeast of Myrloch. Most Gwynneth settlements are built on the ruins of ancient elven communities that date back more than ten thousand years.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b8a7d53-16fa-468d-b2be-2be94a245f2e">The fierce storms that plague the rest of the Moonshaes are less frequent on Gwynneth, though rain is common and leaves all it touches fresh and sweet smelling. Indeed, everything on Gwynneth carries a little enchantment. The mountains rise with stark majesty, and the forests loom deep and mysterious. The fabled Myrloch Vale stands at the center of this magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a73cf89-052e-4916-b5f3-436eaf8f77cf">The magic of Gwynneth makes it perilous. Bullywugs proliferate in the wetlands lining Gwynneth’s coast, and [monsters]Displacer Beast;Displacer Beasts[/monsters] lurk in every forest and mountain vale. The Rusting, however, hasn’t touched Gwynneth. The communities here are so magically isolated from the rest of the isles that their inhabitants haven’t even heard of the Rusting. If the curse reaches this island, the Earthmother herself would be in peril.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CaerCorwell" data-content-chunk-id="e85fc258-7b6f-4c68-ab3b-5e11d84620ca"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CaerCorwell" data-content-chunk-id="5d4eebb5-a5d0-4dc4-a9ea-2915a6a616e0"> </a> Caer Corwell</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8174f6a2-e77e-494c-89f8-9bfd17fda6e7">The ancestral home of the Kendrick family, Caer Corwell fell into ruin after High Lady Ordalf’s arrival. The castle was the lair of evil and mischievous fey for years, but after Ordalf’s retreat to Winterglen, the Kendricks returned to Caer Corwell and rebuilt it. The reconstruction effort brought merchants and crafters aplenty, and the settlements of southern Gwynneth are thriving for the first time in a century. There’s always more to do, such as driving back bullywugs in the Fens of the Fallen or hunting [monsters]Displacer Beast;Displacer Beasts[/monsters] in Llyrath Forest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe25bee4-0c9e-4dc4-8bce-3812db3cb944">Princess Tarilyn Kendrick leads this resurgence. Her marriage to Prince Araithe, Ordalf’s son, was born out of tragedy and political necessity, but the couple found happiness. Tarilyn brings intellect and diplomacy to this relationship, and she is beloved by Ffolk and Norlanders alike. Araithe set aside his sword and armor and spent most of the last two decades raising the couple’s daughter, Caitlyn Kendrick.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Chrysalis" data-content-chunk-id="2a57606d-febd-465e-b85c-46e8d4e8b734"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Chrysalis" data-content-chunk-id="a2f4ad4c-af7c-4e40-b726-823055ff4cc0"> </a> Chrysalis</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8cd7867c-3c39-43a0-be8f-fe3f15ee1442">The elven city of Chrysalis lies hidden within mountains at the southeast corner of Myrloch Vale. Powerful illusions hide the city from the air, and a thick fog conceals the mountain passes. No one can reach the city without a guide.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a97835e-17f4-48fa-8207-58bb6f71e0e9">Chrysalis stands at the center of a lake cradled by these mountains. The Serene Matriarch Ate Onah (Medium [monsters]Noble Prodigy[/monsters]), a young elf of a mere two centuries, rules Chrysalis. After rescuing a Harper near death in the mountains, she agreed to open the city to visitors. Since then, a small community of gnomes has settled in Chrysalis, building two-story cottages among elven towers of glass, silver, and crystal. Harpers use the city as their base in the Moonshaes.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Kingsbay" data-content-chunk-id="db450bdd-fceb-492a-b04c-5969248242ba"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Kingsbay" data-content-chunk-id="bb1af8b2-1857-4a4c-97fe-caaf3c4d329c"> </a> Kingsbay</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86d9e343-80c6-4f87-a666-9bf275bd2872">Once a quiet settlement on Gwynneth’s southeastern shore, Kingsbay was the primary port through which Ffolk returned to the island after Ordalf’s withdrawal to the forest. It’s become a boomtown in the last few years, where anyone looking to strike it rich, escape an unpleasant situation at home, or run from the law can find what they need. There’s always another merchant caravan, military patrol, or wagon train setting out, and no one has time to ask questions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7db64627-ae68-4ce9-bda1-d77cc60fcddf">This busy, get-rich-quick atmosphere allowed Vvim Toth (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Archmage[/monsters]), a human Red Wizard of Thay, to establish a Thayan enclave in Kingsbay, ostensibly providing magical services to well-paying merchants and mercenaries. In truth, Toth seeks information on the moonwells and the secret rites of the Moonshae druids, hoping to use them to fuel his rise to power in Thay.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4639d7eb-7aa5-4c16-9183-09f8e5f45d47">A forested valley with an ancient connection to the Feywild surrounds the lake known as Myrloch, framed by multiple mountain ranges. For centuries, fey creatures have crossed the border between worlds in the Vale, and enough have stayed to make the vale home to a bewildering population of fey. Here, centaurs ride in herds, pixies and [monsters]Sprite;Sprites[/monsters] flit through the air like starlings, and packs of [monsters]Blink Dog;Blink Dogs[/monsters] patrol the trails. Ancient forests are home to dryads and treants. Faerie dragons are especially common here. Druids work with bards of the College of the Moon to keep the peace, monitor moonwells, and perform rites to honor <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="d7463273-e4b7-4db6-af7d-0dbe6490f29b">the Earthmother</a> . Agents of the Emerald Enclave come here to train.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6a64cf9f-6972-487f-85f1-7a1d697654d5">The fairy city of Karador lies beneath the waters of Myrloch. Once home to High Lady Ordalf and thousands of fey, the city sank beneath the waves when the magic of its mythal was broken. Treasure hunters and explorers probe the sunken ruins, preyed on by [monsters]Sea Hag;Sea Hags[/monsters], sahuagin, and giant sea beasts.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Sarifal" data-content-chunk-id="cc860441-fbd4-46bc-b248-71fd243a19db"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Sarifal" data-content-chunk-id="280c0f0d-81d0-4f0c-a9e6-66ceaa993b23"> </a> Sarifal</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa973eae-de03-4679-9c5e-397be3480313">When Karador sank into Myrloch, High Lady Ordalf led the survivors north into the forest of Winterglen. She drove out the arch-hag Urphania and moved into Castle Umbra, Urphania’s old fortress. This deep and dangerous pine forest is now all that remains of the kingdom of Sarifal, which once encompassed all of Gwynneth. Ordalf still rules here, assisted by eladrin who survived the sinking. She is vastly weakened and has been forced to accept evil fey into her court.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="75ba9d69-ccf4-4cd7-a3c5-da09254c68e1">Although fey of every kind dwell here, the Shadowfell has corrupted flora and fauna alike. Trees crowd around trespassing travelers, herding them to their doom deep in the forest; packs of [monsters]Worg;Worgs[/monsters] and [monsters]Displacer Beast;Displacer Beasts[/monsters] prowl unchecked; [monsters]Swarm of Stirges;Swarms of Stirges[/monsters] feast on the slow and the dead.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Storaad" data-content-chunk-id="28c3ceea-9682-47e9-b41e-d4a86f4549a5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Storaad" data-content-chunk-id="908da280-9622-465f-88da-00588f110265"> </a> Storaad</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ebb064e5-1493-4554-ab58-ea6282f36b2b">Norlanders settled the mountains around Myrloch Vale but were driven out by Ordalf’s fey. Now they’re reclaiming their old family homesteads without permission from the high lady or high king. Storaad, a village on the west coast of Gwynneth, is the launching point for these resettlement efforts, which must navigate through the mountains surrounding Myrloch.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfbd2ab6-10fd-48db-b14a-41294c880ca0">In contrast to Alaron, most of the moonwells on Gwynneth are in the north near abandoned Norlander settlements. Norlanders come to these moonwells to commune with <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="2ddf6aa9-e3b1-4a08-8b46-e0c9d0bdd909">the Earthmother</a> . The Rustfire dwarves fled Gwynneth a century ago through tunnels to Alaron. Recently however, these dwarves have reopened the mines in these mountains. Conflict between Norlander families and Rustfire miners has already led to tragedy and could soon erupt into warfare.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2c2953c8-6491-4c60-bd5d-9c898508dcc3">Moray sees the most violence in the Moonshaes. Vicious lycanthropes, enigmatic lizardfolk, mighty giants, proud orcs, Norlanders in thrall to the Rusting, and loyal soldiers of House Kendrick fight for control over the island.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="489f1d35-4d55-4999-a75e-0d6b07999795">Hundreds of [monsters]Werewolf;Werewolves[/monsters] and other evil lycanthropes who follow the Cult of the Beast live here, forming packs around the island’s two moonwells. The Red Moon pack lives in the Shannyth Forest to the south, while the Shadow Moon pack lives in the Tarthwood. Together these groups are called the Red Shadow, and they raid settlements across Moray for captives to sacrifice. Attempts to rescue these captives before their gory death seldom succeed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c98c1811-28fc-44c0-9d21-4029f5d3f0af">Lizardfolk dwell in Breasal Marsh around the Shannyth River. They desire to be left alone, but their position in the center of the island means every other faction on Moray simultaneously trespasses on their land while coveting their allegiance. Red Shadow raiders are so fierce that lizardfolk make no attempt to stop them when they cross the marsh, but they drive other intruders off with force and elemental magic.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CaerMoray" data-content-chunk-id="fb0e4593-6de6-42d0-ac9e-30cffd303896"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CaerMoray" data-content-chunk-id="b9471e6b-278c-44b5-ac03-6094343a8b91"> </a> Caer Moray</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f41c23be-4608-4a01-b643-7a238583f270">High King Kendrick built a stout stone fortress at Caer Moray to guard the port. The garrison includes hundreds of armored cavalry who escort trade shipments to villages on the east side of the island. Stubborn civilians inhabit the villages of Dynnegal, Kork, and Horst, which make up Kendrick’s domain on Moray. They refuse to leave their homes, no matter how dangerous the island becomes. These insular Ffolk developed elaborate customs to avoid lycanthropes, lizardfolk, and orc raiders, such as wearing special clothing to camouflage themselves or traveling only during certain hours of the day.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ad9835b0-b572-4748-a39f-60135ff49a96">Giants and giant kin live in the Trollclaw mountains on the north end of Moray and have built a new home for themselves above the remains of Dennin’s Delve, an ancient dwarven stronghold. A portal connects tunnels beneath Dennin’s Delve with old tunnels under the Fairheight Range in Alaron, and the [monsters]Shadow Dragon (Large);Shadow Dragon[/monsters] menacing the dwarves and orcs of Alaron has sent its minions to Dennin’s Delve. The giants responded by locking the tunnels, and a small band of heroic goliaths later appointed themselves watchers of the locked door. They stand vigil to this day.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d0710bce-8985-477b-8d1b-0800f2f57380">Razed by the Red Moons a century ago, Farview has become a factory for Norlanders embraced by the Rusting. The Rusted chop down the Shannyth Forest, dredge the Breasal Marsh for treasures, and reopen old dwarven mines in the Trollclaws. These raw materials are converted into tools for further resource collection. The high king longs to dislodge these Rusted, but the settlement is protected by imposing walls and fierce warriors.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f224557a-3d05-4c69-a6e7-d4280dad296c">The orcs of the Orcskull Mountains value crafting skill. They live in small family groups focused around a central forge; the smoke from these forges creates a gray pall over the entire range. Although they aggressively defend these mountains, they avoid Highpeak, the tallest mountain in the range. Highpeak is famously haunted by a [monsters]Banshee[/monsters], the spirit of a mother whose four sons died in battle. Her wails can be heard for miles. She supposedly dwells in a glass castle, but it hasn’t been found.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="931c32d3-b67c-4bfd-b17a-96e303546de0">Long ago, Norlanders from Ruathym arrived on the coast of Norland. Some pushed on toward Oman’s Isle, but most remained in Norland, making it the heart of Norlander culture.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a5d072b-acb0-4bd7-860e-92d249cc2b02">This is a hard country with cold winters, frequent storms, and little arable land for farming, but Norland forges its inhabitants into heroes. Boats ply the surrounding waters and sell their catch at Rogarsheim for high profits. The Jotunhammer mountains are a rich source of rare gemstones and valuable ores including copper, iron, silver, and gold. People are free to live the life they make for themselves, and their deeds are remembered by family, friends, and jarl alike.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="807aa831-78b6-4140-9b7b-3b30e4b4fa1f">Some Norlanders instead embrace piracy. Norlander pirates don’t target other Norlanders; they take their longships across the Sea of Swords to capture merchant vessels from Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/baldurs-gate" data-content-chunk-id="eb0a3d45-b195-4012-b870-d831236da7d7">Baldur’s Gate</a> instead. Some Norlanders attack inland, raiding villages and religious buildings along the Sword Coast.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d06d81d1-4d8e-4448-8de8-2b5b8cf740de">The Rusting, however, poses new challenges. It has reached the overfished Bay of Norland. Rusted zones threaten the livelihood of fishers, whales beach themselves on the coast and die, and monsters capsize longboats to prey on their crew.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d8d3e863-3831-4d6d-a16b-75b915246d7f">Norland’s jarl is the human Olfsvenn (Medium [monsters]Warrior Commander[/monsters]), son of Olfgaut, son of Rault the Wise. He has sworn oaths of loyalty to House Kendrick but keeps a terrible secret: his sister Renauta embraced the Rusting and became [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters]. She is now gathering Rusted allies. Driven by the vain hope that he can redeem his sister, Olfsvenn corresponds with Forfallen through letters carried by trusted couriers. When she asks him for favors and information, such as key supplies or knowledge of lucrative targets for piracy, Olfsvenn occasionally obliges her by directing her against his enemies and rivals. Jarl Olfsvenn maintains Stormbanner Hold, a fortress and feasting hall outside the city of Rogarsheim. Famous for his hospitality, Olfsvenn’s generous gifts have bought him the loyalty of many followers. But if the gold were to run out, the jarl might find himself alone.</p>

These mountains were once part of the giant kingdom of Ostoria, and the giants remember its former glory with pride. Oblivious to this legacy, Norlanders intruded on giant enclaves for centuries, attempting to prove their heroism with violence or cunning thefts. Many of these adventures ended in tragedy. Eventually goliaths, firbolgs, and dwarves migrated to the Jotunhammer Range and acted as intermediaries between Norlanders and giants, forging peace treaties. Nevertheless, brave adventurers still try to sneak into giant holds to prove their valor or recover some lost family heirloom, and sometimes they return alive.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1820264b-ec76-446b-a367-3deeb8611115">The Tvarstoldt tar pits lie in the Jotunhammer Range. The Rusting has turned these oozing black pools into a source of Undead and Aberrations. Droves of [monsters]Fomorian;Fomorians[/monsters] lair there and thwart attempts to heal the land. They also threaten a lighthouse north of the pits, built by Ostorian giants and maintained by the jarl’s coffers. The lighthouse warns sailors away from the area’s treacherous rocks. The fomorians plan to claim the lighthouse and extinguish its lamp.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0b5bd730-b4fe-464e-a00e-ac7ac2c1dbeb">The islands of Canthrell, Jotunspine, Llorgh, Graygruun, Rotterock, and Dragonshome are collectively known as the Norheim Isles. This grouping also includes many smaller islands, some too small to support a single Norlander family. The people here barely sustain themselves through fishing and hunting and often turn to raiding or piracy. Small villages are built around a few extended families.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9656e196-9f75-4b15-9414-05d7043a76a5">In these harsh conditions, a single bad season can spell the end for an entire community. As insurance against famine, the locals hunt whales with personally marked spears. Elaborate laws divide whale meat fairly among all whose spears contributed to slaying the whale, although hunters often feud over what constitutes their fair share.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Rogarsheim" data-content-chunk-id="c4b30334-f219-47b8-b55a-6d24e3c776dc"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Rogarsheim" data-content-chunk-id="55b203c0-8d64-4ecb-8214-d779c34ad6c9"> </a> Rogarsheim</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8709cee3-dcf2-444c-a277-ad8476e51f93">Rogarsheim is the bustling capital of Norland, well defended from Rusted raiders by Jarl Olfsvenn’s sizable fleet and made rich through the bounty of the sea. Merchants from the Sword Coast buy fish, whalebone, ambergris, coral, pearls, and rare magical and alchemical ingredients. Shipbuilding is a key industry here, and visitors from across Faerûn come to purchase ships or learn from Norland shipwrights. Goliaths, firbolgs, and dwarves live alongside Norlanders and visiting Ffolk. Purple Dragon Knights maintain a base in Rogarsheim, using it to hunt the werewyvern and investigate the island of Dragonshome to the east. Their fantastic steeds have made the knights a legend among the children of the city. Many aspire to become squires and one day ride a dragon of their own.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="77d8d22b-8bc6-4c3b-9614-64ae52ec1ce3">Signs of the Rusting are evident in the city after years of pollution and overfishing in the Bay of Norland. The water has an oily sheen and a chemical smell, and a thin skin of rusty iron creeps up the timber logs of Rogarsheim’s piers. Dockworkers sometimes fall prey to the curse. Ships that show signs of the Rusting are towed out to the middle of the bay and set on fire.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9bde23f5-dc09-4c9e-a761-7ecc287421ed">Oman’s Isle was once peaceful and picturesque. Norlander families built settlements on the ruins of the old giant kingdom of Ostoria and farmed, kept sheep, and worked mines in the highlands. The last king of Oman’s Isle, Thelgaar Ironhand, remains a folk hero among Ffolk and Norlanders alike.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CairnofThelgaarIronhand" data-content-chunk-id="ef34d6c4-c667-4c89-8204-9adff231ccb1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CairnofThelgaarIronhand" data-content-chunk-id="93547de7-8be4-4f14-a6f5-5495d0cea86d"> </a> Cairn of Thelgaar Ironhand</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="414ab3d8-41b7-440c-96a0-58c18f9eb7ed">The only moonwell on Oman’s Isle lies in the Stone Wood. Thelgaar Ironhand was buried in a stone cairn within this grove, surrounded by menhirs. A small band of druids and bards struggles to keep the grove safe, concealing it with magic to avoid being crushed by giants or the Rusted. But every year, the violent inhabitants of the isle draw closer to discovering the grove’s location. No one knows what the giants would do with the grove, but the lord of Iron Keep’s intentions are clear: to plunder the cairn and corrupt the moonwell with the Rusting.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="139e32f1-8860-4db0-acbc-431cdece9995">Years ago, a coalition of giants from Maelstrom returned to Oman’s Isle in enormous longboats, driving the previous inhabitants out of their homes and across the water. Now the giants live in small but well-established steadings across the isle, especially where Ostorian ruins were left intact in the Grampalt Highlands. [monsters]Hill Giant;Hill Giants[/monsters] cluster on the eastern slopes, protecting their steadings with kennels of [monsters]Dire Wolf;Dire Wolves[/monsters]. [monsters]Frost Giant;Frost Giants[/monsters] occupy the western highlands, which are covered in freezing rain and snow. Under the shadow of Icepeak, the region’s tallest mountain, frost giants herd [monsters]Giant Goat;Giant Goats[/monsters], build ships, and raid Gwynneth from across the Strait of Oman. [monsters]Fire Giant;Fire Giants[/monsters] reopened the old Norlander mines underneath the highlands and sell the ore they find to Iron Keep in exchange for treasures gathered in Rusted raids.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4727b528-162b-4fa6-8b92-b80ec1f6f8dc">Norlanders constructed Iron Keep on the site of an Ostorian fortress, and it was once their greatest stronghold. From here, Thelgaar Ironhand ruled as king of Oman’s Isle. The Norlanders of Oman’s Isle joined the kingdom after his death, and Iron Keep was a jewel in the Kendrick crown.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="065cf9a1-fd63-439d-b1fa-d2a4188b2ed0">Iron Keep was abandoned when the giants invaded Oman’s Isle, and it lay empty for decades. Now it is home to Axenwight (Medium, Chaotic Evil, Rusted [monsters]Pirate Captain[/monsters]; see the “<a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary#Rusted" data-content-chunk-id="5a1e8a30-b84d-43c3-96d7-022deb98d13e">Other Rusted</a> ” sidebar in <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary" data-content-chunk-id="c45280ad-f1e5-41b7-ba96-7dd9cb0b6dbe">chapter 9</a> ), one of [monsters]Queen Forfallen;Queen Forfallen’s[/monsters] chief lieutenants. No one knows why the giants tolerate Axenwight’s presence in Oman’s Isle, but rumor has it that the queen cut a deal with the fire giants, and the frost and hill giants followed along according to giant custom.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3118615-873a-4628-a4e4-f776093dc867">Although he’s proclaimed himself jarl of Oman’s Isle, Axenwight controls only the area around Iron Bay. From here, he harvests from the Stone Wood, buys ore from giants, and builds ships and weapons for [monsters]Queen Forfallen;Queen Forfallen’s[/monsters] war machine. His desire to plunder Thelgaar Ironhand’s tomb draws treasure seekers who promise to satisfy Axenwight’s greed. However, expedition attempts have failed, and Axenwight doesn’t tolerate failure.</p>

In the years since, the village has become a settlement for creatures who serve giants or associate with them: firbolgs, goliaths, ettins, ogres, and cyclopes. These new inhabitants expanded the old village by reclaiming building stones from ancient Ostoria, assembling homes that suit their stature.

<p data-content-chunk-id="7e6e3bfa-0e6c-45f4-ac76-fb772371ed50">Snowdown’s history is rife with sorrow and devastation. Located on the south end of the Moonshaes, Snowdown was protected from harsh weather by Gwynneth in the west and was once the most temperate and fertile of the isles. Ffolk dwelled there on quiet and peaceful farms. They left the rest of the violent Moonshaes alone and expected to be left alone in return.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49d39226-5949-4784-aca2-4dffd15a28c4">During the Amn invasion a century ago, the enigmatic and cruel vampire Erliza Daressin took over the island. Amn soldiers plundered Snowdown’s rich natural resources, stripping mines bare and chopping down forests. Waterways were redirected into open mines or other industrial projects, creating toxic ponds. The invaders crushed local resistance with impunity. Then Erliza headed off retaliation from High King Derid Kendrick by abducting his only son, Owaren.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b56f8855-e68c-4ce9-a0c9-3d788ce01f92">Owaren died trying to escape, a tragedy that united High King Kendrick and High Lady Ordalf. Derid’s daughter, Tarilyn Kendrick, and Ordalf’s son, Prince Araithe, led a united army against Caer Westphal, and Tarilyn’s magic permanently destroyed Erliza. However, the vampire’s dying words became a curse that plagues the Moonshae Isles to this day.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e52aafaa-15bd-4c4a-9c2a-c90390a084f9">The Rusting first manifested at Snowdown’s only moonwell, located near the center of the island. Amn mercenaries had chased off the moonwell’s druid. Without its protectors, the waters of this moonwell turned to a slick, glistening oil, its surrounding stones withered to rust, and the trees of its grove whitened and died. Meanwhile, attempts to rein in the environmental destruction caused by Amn have ended in disaster. When a dam blocking the Harloch was demolished, a crushing wave of floodwaters mixed with open mines, reducing southern Snowdown to a putrid swamp.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9f9a364-7d7b-4b01-b646-3f374b55424d">Decades after Erliza’s defeat and the withdrawal of Amn, Snowdown is a blight on the Moonshaes. A few small settlements struggle on, but sickness and famine shrink the population year after year. Ffolk brave droves of Aberrations and Undead within the unstable tunnels of the highland mines in search of riches. Only one small forest remains, full of stunted and discolored trees. The natural path of the island’s waterways has never been restored; [monsters]Fomorian;Fomorians[/monsters] and Rusted raiders attack anyone who tries and take no prisoners.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CaerWestphal" data-content-chunk-id="a33d8ec9-e747-4d2e-9e1f-9a38a5e5eaba"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#CaerWestphal" data-content-chunk-id="a9b393be-ca8a-4c47-8b6f-ec51c0f159b0"> </a> Caer Westphal</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62abcdb7-72cd-44e2-a55f-c2b5b2fb611f">Snowdown’s capital, Caer Westphal, is relatively safe. From the high towers of Caer Westphal’s castle, Governor Eduard Westphal (Medium [monsters]Noble[/monsters]), chosen for his loyalty to the high king and familial connections to Snowdown, combats the island’s dismal decline. Eduard recognizes how desperate things are on the island but has few resources to do anything about it. He focuses his efforts on keeping the Snowdown Ride safe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b7cef233-7a88-445f-9517-f63324aaa4b2">Caer Westphal surrounds a harbor that shows signs of Amn occupation decades after the war. Tall cargo cranes line the docks, and rows of rusty shipping containers stand stacked where Amn mercenaries left them. Although much of Caer Westphal stands empty, refugees fleeing their polluted farms and villages occupy these shipping containers so they’re poised to board any ship that will carry them elsewhere.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="490e7c7a-d42a-475a-97be-51f43210dc65">A single road, the Snowdown Ride, leads south from Landrian to the village of Harloch, crosses through Caer Westphal, and ends at Pengram. Amn forces widened the Snowdown Ride during their regime, paving it with a mixture of lime, mortar, water, and volcanic ash. Over the years this substance has cracked, rendering the road unusable to wagons.</p>

    <p>“I never met Uncle Owaren. He died before I was born, and I’m already older than he ever got to be. Why do you think I spend my nights out having fun with my fey cousins, instead of playing the perfect princess? I’m living for both of us.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="245b55ef-9ef8-4868-b6a7-5137f147349e">On the tip of land east of Caer Westphal lies the tomb of Owaren Kendrick, unsullied by the island’s ecological devastation. Surrounded by a silver fence and protected by the magic of Moonshae druids, verdant grass and white, crescent-shaped flowers surround a stone memorial under the shade of a massive oak tree. The tomb has become a symbol of the alliance between Ffolk, Norlanders, and fey, and it is a site of pilgrimage for travelers willing to risk Snowdown’s dangers.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="456d7d8b-4959-4b24-900f-de050ee7d62d">The most famous of the Moonshae’s wandering isles is Caer Allisyn, the burial place of the first queen of the Moonshaes. This island rises from the sea in sunlight four times a year and has been spotted in different places: sometimes in the Strait of Alaron, other times north of Oman’s Isle. The queen is buried in the castle for which the island is named, but only a few fortunate heroes have ever seen it for themselves.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0f148b1f-3095-4805-b7ae-e36322f06fb1">Many of the Moonshaes’ smaller islands are part of the Korinn Archipelago. Here, sparse forests grow amid rugged, rocky cliffs. Nearly all of these islands are inhabited. Families on these islands subsist on fishing, shepherding, and raiding. Many frequent sailors of the Sea of Moonshae have a favorite fishing spot, safe haven, or smuggler’s cache hidden among the islands of the archipelago.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3642efb6-2cb4-454a-9faa-de09604ca415">Some of the archipelago’s islands are wandering isles. Yet others are home to pirate bands, fey, elven ruins, or giants who hurl stones at visitors.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="57064788-ee2f-4c23-a000-44281e8ebcce">The sahuagin kingdom of Kressilac lies at the floor of the Sea of Moonshae. From here, sahuagin ride hungry sharks to raid Alaron, Gwynneth, and Oman’s Isle. Few humanoids have ever seen Kressilac’s coral palaces and kelp gardens.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Maelstrom" data-content-chunk-id="aea5768c-b44b-499b-8647-6fd2a5066793"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Maelstrom" data-content-chunk-id="27852262-a919-42f6-af0f-b393c026c121"> </a> Maelstrom</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63092d1c-dac8-4143-8275-80675cda7a84">Sometimes the natural currents around Ruathym, Whalebones, and the Moonshaes combine and create a whirlpool strong enough to draw in ships. Ships caught in its currents are torn apart and their wreckage drifts to the ocean floor three thousand feet below, where it is picked clean by [monsters]Giant Crab;Giant Crabs[/monsters].</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47606613-5167-4e07-94dc-965faaa92089">The storm giant stronghold called Maelstrom lies underneath the whirlpool. The undersea fortress of Serissa, queen of the giants, is carved into a reef. Four rocky towers covered in barnacles and coral reach upward, ringing a large sinkhole that descends into the heart of the fortress. (For more on Maelstrom and Queen Serissa, see <em>Storm King’s Thunder.</em> )</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Ruathym" data-content-chunk-id="70511c2b-3477-43cd-946e-cbcff8daa226"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Ruathym" data-content-chunk-id="257d5238-eda4-4caf-8e6b-20835661094a"> </a> Ruathym</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e51890fc-4a7e-4fca-9330-d83dc008dc74">Norlander culture was born on the island of Ruathym, two hundred miles north of the Moonshaes. Seeking to escape the bleak and mountainous Ruathym, wracked by strong waves and bitter cold, Norlanders sent longships south and east, settling in both the Moonshaes and the old city of Illusk (now Luskan). While Norlanders of the Moonshaes have little reason to return to Ruathym, they still tell stories of their people’s grand exodus. [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters] uses the settlement of Ruathym as a safe harbor, selling plunder from her raids, buying supplies, and recruiting fresh crew.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Whalebones" data-content-chunk-id="cb33de61-acbd-45c1-893a-2b5df563377e"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#Whalebones" data-content-chunk-id="40470582-98e2-48e9-a6e2-6a57a1728a47"> </a> Whalebones</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dde95724-0d4d-4bb3-8b23-5a5642a63e79">Whales have come to the small rocky islands east of Ruathym known as Whalebones for as long as Norlanders have chronicled their history. Rocs perch on the islands’ tallest peaks, and the islands’ fierce locals eagerly take food and supplies by force from anyone foolish enough to draw near.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="13640b5c-cac6-45ba-a8c3-2b3c578fc94c">Druids believe that the whales come here to honor and commune with their dead ancestors and have banned whale hunting near the islands. Unfortunately, overfishing elsewhere in the Moonshaes has drawn whalers to the Whalebones in a clear violation of tradition. Inhabitants of Whalebones have begun striking back at whaling ships to protect the pods.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4b5f4111-f67c-49c8-a179-f8e459e7aa50">Adventures in the Moonshaes Isles often feature distinct themes such as fairy tale elements and eco-fantasy. The following section expounds on these themes and how to use them in your adventures.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="46fac474-ad87-4bbf-8072-3c7ae6be55c9">Fey are seldom far away in the Moonshae Isles, especially on Gwynneth and around Myrloch Vale. Bullywugs and goblins bedevil novice adventurers, while experienced heroes confront hags and displacer beasts. Any denizen of the Feywild might appear through a fey crossing—this includes non-Fey creatures such as dragons and unicorns, as well as mastiffs, wolves, and elk, which are popular animal companions there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36bd8ffe-329d-46af-83f2-dc0c59b15607">A coven of hags makes an especially good recurring villain for a Moonshae Isles campaign, but you also might use a [monsters]Winter Eladrin[/monsters] (see <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/motm" data-content-chunk-id="3c0043a7-f4de-40e2-8133-6f4337d406d1">Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a> ).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18055145-0d1a-45b2-bc94-eb17f041d856">In fairy stories, characters often solve problems diplomatically rather than by fighting. Characters encounter fey with specific needs or desires—such as the guardian of a fairy trod—and if the characters bring the fey the thing they need, the fey lets them pass. An adventure location might be guarded by a fey knight who offers to duel challengers, but the knight might be won over by less combative means such as bringing him a fey steed or composing a ballad that glorifies his exploits. Evil fey can be thwarted this way as well; characters who steal the eye from a coven of hags might be able to trade it back to the hags in exchange for the hags’ cooperation. When you design fairy tale adventures, keep an open mind to nonviolent solutions proposed by your players, and consider challenges that can be overcome with skills, relationships, and roleplay.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SailingtheMoonshaes" data-content-chunk-id="11f85739-80c4-48c1-bc59-51900cf0349a"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#SailingtheMoonshaes" data-content-chunk-id="8d3fad2e-7aac-49ca-9141-ef7f7f1248ab"> </a> Sailing the Moonshaes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8dad7381-9108-476a-95d6-b7947d12cec9">In the Moonshaes, you’re never more than a day’s travel from the water, and many locals know how to handle a boat. Moonshae stories often require the characters to sail to one or more islands.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c766710-a4d7-4b8f-ae43-25b127697664">Norlander adventures often focus on piracy, raiding, or whaling. Norlander longships raid coastal settlements and prey on passing ships, so pirates and raiders make great enemies for your characters. You can use Humanoid creatures in the <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/mm-2024" data-content-chunk-id="c4c7c2e2-75d5-4e43-b7ae-6d60b5d9a016">Monster Manual</a> such as guards, scouts, berserkers, priests of Tempus, and, of course, pirates for Norlander raiders. They might bring animals or other monstrous companions with them on raids, such as [monsters]Winter Wolf;Winter Wolves[/monsters] or a pet [monsters]Owlbear[/monsters]. After the characters fight off a raid, they might follow the raiders back to their home and negotiate with (or threaten) their leader to end the attacks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28a0b9f5-f79b-444e-9a54-71570cb6f2ec">Whaling has been part of Norland culture for centuries, and many Norland families depend on whales for survival. Whaling is an extraordinarily dangerous task that could make for exciting adventures. A successful hunt can yield meat for a village of hungry Norlanders and lucrative byproducts like ambergris and whalebone. But sometimes the “whale” turns out to be a [monsters]Dragon Turtle[/monsters] or an [monsters]Ancient Sea Serpent[/monsters] (see <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/ftod" data-content-chunk-id="f2af30c1-6fcf-4c76-bad0-65d486b88a27">Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons</a> ).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cafdc810-218a-4d56-acf0-1e5c9609faca">Seafaring adventures can also center around trade and exploration. In these stories, merchants hire characters to escort them through dangerous waters. The characters or one of their NPC allies might have their own ship. The party can discover undersea settlements and meet D&amp;D’s vast array of underwater creatures, including vicious [monsters]Kuo-Toa;kuo-toa[/monsters], [monsters]Merrow[/monsters], and [monsters]Sahuagin;sahuagin[/monsters], or the heroic merfolk and tritons (described in <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/motm" data-content-chunk-id="65e774b5-f301-4b86-9d25-5ad7679efc93">Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a> ).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="506e69fe-2b9e-4caf-8c91-d4155290ea0c">The Earthmother is a divine embodiment of the Moonshae Islands, and the Rusting is a supernatural curse that embodies environmental destruction, exploitation, and pollution. This makes the Moonshaes an excellent place to explore stories of eco-fantasy, in which heroic characters protect nature while addressing ecological disasters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4e95aea-fae6-498a-aae6-aa38876b3a21">Druids, Rangers, and other characters with a connection to nature or the fey are often drawn into eco-fantasy adventures, but other characters might have a role as outsiders learning the importance of living things and the environment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4dddabc6-c992-4f21-ae89-01af34c7b743">People living in the Moonshaes sometimes cause environmental damage as a consequence of industrialization or overpopulation. Overfishing, cutting down forests, and draining wetlands are examples. In these stories, solving the problem often requires creative solutions and negotiation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ec35a00-d9fb-4e42-aa93-29cf7cf79d57">The allegorical nature of eco-fantasy can also lend itself to stories of Aberrations, Undead, and Rusted creatures causing environmental destruction by design, not by accident. These adventures threaten the ecology of the Moonshaes and, by extension, <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="1607dd43-a7ac-49fa-9a29-65cef8a097fd">the Earthmother</a> . They are also a direct threat to the characters’ lives, which the characters must respond to with heroic violence.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BuildingAlliances" data-content-chunk-id="bca3a921-51a8-4503-8bc7-e064f68617ae"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#BuildingAlliances" data-content-chunk-id="5acf3143-ee7f-4eaf-a651-1d86a5f6b435"> </a> Building Alliances</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f5e2266-79f1-4a50-81b8-411cc0b5881e">Norlanders and Ffolk warred for generations before coming together and forging a united Moonshaes. This motif—longtime enemies finding shared purpose—recurs in Moonshae Isles adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c51c53e7-16c3-4a70-a7a3-cb27dda56832">Relations between the fey of Sarifal and the humanoid inhabitants of the isles demonstrate this motif again. High Lady Ordalf brought thousands of fey to Myrloch Vale in defiance of the high king, driving the Kendrick family out of their ancestral home. But the two sides united after the death of Owaren Kendrick.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="357bcd15-29e2-42ce-8e34-b980336516d9">Tensions between ancient enemies in the Moonshaes persist to this day. Orcs and dwarves fight beneath the mountains of Alaron. Giants have returned to Oman’s Isle, driving out Norlanders and Ffolk alike. Good and evil fey quarrel according to ancient rules. Negotiating with these groups isn’t easy. If the disparate groups in the Moonshaes are to live together in peace, heroic characters must help them find common ground.</p>
  <h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MoonshaeConflicts" data-content-chunk-id="125b6845-1d2e-42a1-bcca-b7b20ce3719b"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#MoonshaeConflicts" data-content-chunk-id="7c0f34b6-c0df-48b0-8bed-97e12f31ad74"> </a> Moonshae Conflicts</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3782b821-167f-4092-a63a-7a7e3aafef23">Moonshae Isles campaigns often involve High King Kendrick’s efforts to bring a lasting peace to the Moonshae Isles. At the same time, the characters might investigate the Rusting, try to prevent its spread, and eventually try to end it.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HighKingKendricksPeace" data-content-chunk-id="957e714a-438b-471e-ade0-fa8bda2215d4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#HighKingKendricksPeace" data-content-chunk-id="160de0dd-c180-41cb-b6dc-31a3a228bed4"> </a> High King Kendrick’s Peace</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36c28c48-463c-44ed-aa6c-c1175424bf66">High King Kendrick wants to unite the Moonshaes into a single, peaceful land. But he can’t do that alone. He expects his realm and that of High Lady Ordalf to be united only after Princess Caitlyn inherits the throne. In the meantime, Kendrick wants to bring rivals and warring factions together.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PoliticalGoals" data-content-chunk-id="afd013b9-486b-472a-8947-6d7a33c12755"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#PoliticalGoals" data-content-chunk-id="5afbf925-a725-44ec-94da-c83fd9d5a087"> </a> Political Goals</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8db107c-2a16-492a-b5b6-2ebbf1dd9dd4">The rulers of the Moonshae Isles are proud people who do as they please. They expect their customs and territory to be respected, and they expect to be treated like the nobles they are. While some of these rulers might be persuaded to unite peacefully, others—like [monsters]Queen Forfallen[/monsters] or the leaders of the Red Shadow—might need to be defeated by force.</p>
  <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ForgingthePeace" data-content-chunk-id="836bf81e-817a-4a59-8074-0ec9a2885301"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#ForgingthePeace" data-content-chunk-id="a3ef571c-cb8b-429d-bafe-348eb134d0b3"> </a> Forging the Peace</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fdd15280-6337-44fa-8f78-ecf671964bcc">A campaign aimed at bringing the people of the Moonshae Isles together might follow this broad outline.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f8f64c91-13d9-4f2b-b47b-0931fe8dc6aa"><strong><em> Levels 1–4. </em></strong> When the characters rescue a trapped musician, they inherit a castle, which gets them noticed by rulers throughout the isles. You can use “Message in a Bottle” in this chapter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26b6a289-8043-4ac6-9b7e-fa145b65eeeb"><strong><em> Levels 5–10. </em></strong> Leaders throughout the isles test the characters and, when the characters pass these tests, the rulers ask them for help. You can use “Wreck of the Silverhand” and “The Treaty of Ostoria” (both in this chapter) to introduce Jarl Olfsvenn and High King Kendrick.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36269bb6-3f1f-4c62-864d-777f5f6caba1"><strong><em> Levels 11–16. </em></strong> Once the characters have won the friendship of various factions, they can bring those groups together to settle their differences and bring peace to the Moonshaes. Evil giants, wicked fey, and bloodthirsty lycanthropes oppose this peace.</p>
  <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheRustingConflict" data-content-chunk-id="e3bbc997-ee9f-4880-a7bd-048379f0c5a9"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#TheRustingConflict" data-content-chunk-id="dffc3075-46c4-4cbe-9a9e-62aeba29ae30"> </a> The Rusting</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5034d48b-478e-4523-a63b-a263019d1c60">The Rusting is an existential threat to the Moonsea Isles. If it were to reach moonwells in Gwynneth, even <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="648016a0-7a5b-4b2a-bb4c-8e05820ea91b">the Earthmother</a> herself might be in danger.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1618275f-9190-412d-913f-66cf882b808a">Creatures cursed by the Rusting relish despoiling nature by cutting down forests, damming rivers, poisoning wells, and spreading the curse. Many of these creatures focus on bringing the curse to moonwells, especially those on Gwynneth where <a href="#TheEarthmother" data-content-chunk-id="e7b70197-5c22-4d6c-9d24-24dc5ef3a8fa">the Earthmother</a> is strongest.</p>
