  <p class="fraif-dropcap">
    Icewind Dale and its settlements—called Ten-Towns—beckon the reckless, the desperate, and those
    willing to face what waits at the world’s farthest edge. People come here to make their fortunes
    or to disappear. You never know who you might encounter, wrapped in winter gear, trudging
    through snowy streets: a friend, a monster, or a stranger willing to kill to protect their
    secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond Ten-Towns, hidden societies of dwarves and goliaths carve out homes in the arctic land,
    its crags and valleys shaped by half-remembered battles between giants and demons. From the
    Reghed Glacier in the east to the Sea of Moving Ice in the north, nomadic tribes travel with the
    beasts and seasons, crafting a way of life where others see only death. Out in that frozen
    wasteland, terror takes many forms—frost giants and remorhazes, yetis and winter wolves,
    cultists and hags—and some in Icewind Dale whisper of an inhuman figure with multiple limbs,
    half glimpsed through a blizzard or a troubled dream. This being, whose existence is often
    discounted as mere superstition, is Zlan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Zlan is what remains of the seven liches that created the shattered Artifact called
    <em>Crenshinibon</em> or the <em>Crystal Shard</em>—the remnants of which still can be found
    across Icewind Dale as the material called chardalyn. Those whose minds are warped by chardalyn
    fall under Zlan’s control. Zlan seeks to thaw the Underdark beneath Icewind Dale, releasing
    ancient monsters and exposing the ancient magical sites under the dale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Zlan’s melting of the Underdark has caused several deep dragons to notice Icewind Dale—and to
    covet its secrets. This deep dragon alliance threatens the entire region. While these dragons
    pose a physical threat, their natural ability to adopt the shape of any creature—and their
    interest in lost and forgotten lore—means they could be anywhere and anyone.

  Icewind Dale is deadly not only for its extreme environment but also for its secretive residents
  and the sinister forces hidden by the cold. To survive, you might need to venture into the winter
  or the Underdark, fight to escape the hungering wild, or seek clues to reveal what stalks you in
  the night before that creature can sink its fangs into your spine. Flawed heroes and renegades
  must band together, doing whatever it takes to stay alive—no matter the cost.

  the dark, silence, and alien beauty of caverns lit by glowing mushrooms and infested by aberrant
  terrors. Duergar, deep dragons, mind flayers, and stranger creatures lurk where secrets are
  entombed. For characters willing to brave its hazards, the Underdark is a bottomless trove of
  wonders and horrors, of beauty and danger, waiting to be discovered.

  Icewind Dale was once the dwelling place of frost giants, demons, and white dragons. Dwarves and
  humans came later, carving out lives in the bitter cold and endless wind. Eventually, tales of
  gold, gems, and ivory drew prospectors and settlers north. These settlers from across Faerûn built
  the fishing, mining, forestry, and trading camps that grew to be Ten-Towns.

    >Ten-Towns</a
  >, as southerners come to trade, escape, or build new lives. Ten-Towns accepts anyone willing to
  work, as long as they don’t stir up trouble. Ten-Towners are tough, weather-tested people from all
  walks of life who lean on each other to survive. Community and trust are everything here; nobody
  lives long in the wilderness alone.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ecc62a8-5ea5-429f-b87d-5a52d30a962d">
  The biggest industry in Ten-Towns is fishing for knucklehead trout. The ivory-like bones of these
  massive lake-dwelling fish are prized for carved pieces called scrimshaw, which sells for a good
  price down south. Ten-Towners also trade, hunt, trap, harvest lumber, and prospect for gems and
  gold nuggets in the rocks and rivers on which their settlements are built.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="615e726f-c356-48e3-8ac5-0eb972c59854">
  Bad weather makes travel difficult, so Ten-Towners use snowshoes, dogsleds, or tamed axe beak
  mounts. Recently, raiders from the fallen settlement called

  Scattered shrines and run-down temples see few but fervent worshipers. In the evenings, taverns in
  Ten-Towns fill with cold, tired people looking to warm up, gripe a bit, and share a rumor and a
  flagon—especially if someone else is paying.

  Governance
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="624d2fcf-7599-4c50-ac09-747462b40a83">
  Towns are led by elected speakers who gather irregularly to discuss trade, hash out agreements,
  and settle—or start—disputes. Speakers have little use for each other, and Ten-Towns nurse grudges
  over fishing, forestry, hunting rights, and old insults. Elections are held when speakers die,
  quit, or are driven out. In larger settlements, speakers lean on appointed marshals or sheriffs to
  rally militias, address threats and crime, and administer justice.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f336d1cd-1f54-4843-843b-6e43cdb60e9c">
  Each Ten-Town answers only to itself, and rivalries between the settlements deepen their
  isolationist impulses. Though hunters, trappers, and traders regularly interact with Reghed nomads
  or dwarves from Dwarven Valley, Ten-Towners look on outsiders with suspicion, convinced strangers
  are more likely to rob and murder them than to extend a friendly hand.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b1a89264-4847-4760-886f-bb93721b6da7">
  For Reghed nomads, the icy plains and howling winds aren’t hardships—they’re home. These hardy
  folk travel in the tracks of caribou and other beasts, driven by harsh weather, tradition, and the
  pursuit of prey. To be Reghed is to embrace the cold, living free from the rot found in the south.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="616a5afc-bb41-4a9a-83c8-596cf52efc1e">
  Reghed are primarily human and organized into tribes made up of small camps that follow a

  prey. Five main tribes exist today.

      and that honoring her keeps her influence alive. These Abolishers are gaining power and
      influence. Their eyes and ire are fixed on Auril’s worshipers in Caer-Dineval.

      In an ancient and nearly forgotten time, seven liches joined their magic in a fragile alliance
      to craft an item of ultimate power called <em>Crenshinibon</em> (better known as the
      <em>Crystal Shard</em> ), with which they meant to conquer all life. At the moment of its
      completion, the undead wizard-kings were consumed by their own creation’s power. It
      obliterated their conscious minds and absorbed what was left of their souls into itself.

  Millennia later, a wizard named Akar Kessel found the <em>Crystal Shard.</em> The shard had become
  infused with demonic magic, and he used it to erect a great black tower in Icewind Dale. When this
  tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is
  now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance cold to the touch and strong as metal,
  though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, deposits of chardalyn have
  been found across Icewind Dale. These deposits tend to be suffused with evil magic. Chardalyn
  readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal raw material for crafting magic items.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3a5bb0e-35e4-4e33-b587-1c13509e7ef1">
  The splintering of the <em>Crystal Shard</em> awoke the fragmented spirits of the seven liches
  that forged the Artifact. Each of these seven spirits was fractured and infused into the tiny
  fragments of chardalyn scattered across Icewind Dale. Gradually, they returned to awareness until
  they eventually found an egg-shaped piece of chardalyn large enough to contain their spirits. They
  moved into it, and within the egg they created a new form for themselves. The seven undead spirits
  struggled mightily for control of this new form until the one called Zlan won the battle. Then the
  horrific new body the seven liches had forged forced its way out of the chardalyn egg.

  handle, shape, or wield chardalyn. Zlan wants to expose more of the people of Icewind Dale to this
  substance, extending the spirit’s insidious psychic influence. Because large amounts of chardalyn
  lie buried in the Underdark, Zlan has subtly influenced unsuspecting individuals throughout
  Icewind Dale to descend beneath the ice and attract the attention of Underdark monsters. Zlan is
  also responsible for new steam vents that make exploring the Underdark easier than ever before.

  Zlan’s greatest achievement since regaining self-awareness was corrupting an ancient frost druid
  of the Tribe of the Raging Bear and beckoning her into the frozen Underdark. There, at Zlan’s
  urging, she unleashed a fatal explosion of primal magic, uncapping underground steam vents and
  causing magma flows to surge upward, shaking the deep and starting a chain reaction of warming
  from below.

  The consequences of this explosion reverberate throughout Icewind Dale. Earthquakes shake the
  land, and vents open in the ice and rock, emitting giant plumes of steam visible for miles.

  One method to build fear at your table is by introducing a single source of terror that escalates
  over the course of the session, ending in a jump scare. Examples of this technique abound in
  horror movies and other media. The shark in <em>Jaws</em> and the eponymous alien shape-shifter of
  <em>The Thing</em> both illustrate the jump scare in action.

  Several ingredients combine to build a good jump scare. First, set the scene with an atmosphere of
  unease. Then, startle the players with something harmless, which they might mistake for the true
  threat. Next, show the threat in such a way that the party can’t directly interact with it. For
  example, it might be too far away to attack, even with ranged weapons. Now let the silence or
  sense of unease build, increasing tension at the table. Finally,

  Buried Treasure is decorated with hundreds of objects dug up from the mud of the Shaengarne by
  Cora Mulphoon’s guests and then donated to the inn. Most hold little value—gnarled pieces of
  driftwood, broken pottery, a battered shield bearing a Cormyrean noble’s crest—but displayed in a
  glass case on the mantle is a gold nugget the size of a knucklebone. At least, that’s what Cora
  tells visitors it is. In truth, it’s a rock that she disguised with a bit of paint, but the
  opportunity it promises to those who see it sparkling above the hearth keeps hopeful visitors

  those recently arrived in Icewind Dale. They’re always eager to help newcomers find their feet,

  divine services. She argues frequently with her rock gnome assistant, Copper Knobberknocker

  <strong><em>House of the Triad.</em></strong> One of the largest stone buildings in Icewind Dale,
  the House of the Triad is a temple to Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater. The house was shuttered during
  Auril’s everlasting winter by townsfolk angered because the priests were helpless before Auril’s
  wrath, but it has since reopened, albeit humbler than before. The temple serves the faithful and
  stockpiles food and supplies in preparation for future crises, making it a prime target for

  <strong><em>Market Square.</em></strong> Market Square is Bryn Shander’s beating heart. Stalls and
  tents sell knucklehead trout, scrimshaw, vegetables, reindeer meat, handicrafts, and cold weather
  gear. The false soothsayer Echomorne harangues the crowd from her pavilion while one or two
  militia members ensure order. Characters who catch the seer’s eye receive personalized predictions
  of doom. Once she makes a prediction, she tries to bring it about—or at least trouble her victims
  with nightmares so they are too exhausted to doubt her words.

  the adventuring life and allows capable travelers between jobs to stay on credit—but what seems at
  first like charity catches up with unwary characters when Scramsax presents an itemized bill
  loaded with surcharges once their fortunes improve. Those who refuse to meet his terms learn that
  Scramsax retired out of choice, not necessity, as he’s still capable with a blade.

  settlement’s real leader is the orc Yldreth (Medium, Lawful Neutral [monsters]Druid[/monsters]), a
  frost druid rejected by the Emerald Enclave who channels Auril’s wrath to defend her people.
  Yldreth offers faithful sacrifices of food, warmth, and reverence to Auril to maintain a constant
  winter storm around the castle, containing its menace (see “The Caer” below). She’s in search of
  mercenaries to retake the castle, but she doesn’t intend to join these missions herself, since she
  is focused on the village’s protection, not self-sacrifice.

  The castle was built over four hundred years ago by the wealthy Dinev family from Cormyr. When a
  band of aggressive orcs attacked, the Dinevs hid in the castle, leaving the townsfolk to be killed
  or driven off. The invaders took the castle, only to be pushed out by later waves of settlers.
  More recently, the castle was occupied by Knights of the Black Sword, cultists of the archdevil
  Levistus, which led to the village’s present woes.

  The Black Swords’ diabolical rites opened a portal to Stygia and drew the attention of Levistus’s
  rival, Geryon, who sent fiends to infest the castle’s depths. His influence has also drawn evil

  territory.

<p data-content-chunk-id="a0cb0157-3dc9-481d-af42-ae2bba170683">
  Yldreth’s magic keeps the castle surrounded by a perpetual blizzard. Its walls rise twenty feet
  above ground level, and its basement and ice tunnels run deep below the frozen ground. Gaping
  holes yawn in the towers, walls, and upper rooms, ripped open by the
  [monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters], [monsters]Ogre;Ogres[/monsters], and
  [monsters]Ettin;Ettins[/monsters] that fight for control of the upper levels. The castle’s lower

  A bitter wind from Kelvin’s Cairn sweeps over the tiny village of Caer-Konig, lonely and almost

  They are led by the goblin Gutstab Grimbutcher ([monsters]Goblin Hexer[/monsters]), who can be

  The village’s new speaker, the wood elf Festris Pilcone (Medium, Chaotic Evil
  [monsters]Noble[/monsters]), was recruited from the south to rebuild Good Mead’s apiary after the
  chardalyn dragon attack. His beekeeping expertise has led to more mead than ever, in new varieties
  that have increased demand. New bees were brought from the south, and the mead hall was rebuilt
  larger than before.

  Festris’s scientific mind and honeyed words have charmed the settlement, as has his lifelong

  The spreading hemlock called Jagged Pine once grew in the deep forest, its roots sunk into soil

  As a result of Zlan’s influence, tension, guilt, and paranoia curdle the air here. Fights break
  out between old friends, people hole up in shacks in the woods, and threats follow the slightest
  provocation. Barker eventually murdered Cas and fled into the forest; he hasn’t been seen since.
  If the tree isn’t destroyed or returned to the woods soon, the entire village may fall to murder
  and mayhem, or disappear entirely as people slink away south or into the woods, never to be seen

  Underdark Access

<p data-content-chunk-id="cefeaed9-bfee-40ff-ac1e-ebfd43fe4f5f">
  Termalaine’s mine has always been its most notable feature. Now, however, interest has reached a
  fever pitch, and the town brims with strangers crowding every inn and private residence, lining up
  before dawn to enter the mine northeast of town.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a63c7ae-e2d2-4620-bee3-227a28b49e34">
  The mine opened up due to shifts in the Underdark far below. The few miners on hand that day heard
  a deep rumbling, which they first took to be a cave-in until they discovered that the bottom of
  several passages had dropped out, exposing glittering caverns and ruins below. As more surface
  dwellers descend, denizens of the Underdark stir. [monsters]Darkmantle;Darkmantles[/monsters],
  [monsters]Roper;Ropers[/monsters], [monsters]Grick;Gricks[/monsters], and [monsters]Hook
  Horror;Hook Horrors[/monsters] hunt in the dark, while myconids, watching impassively, send out
  spores to trace the contours of new minds. Worst of all, mind flayers have enthralled miners and
  sent them back to the surface as scouts—the subservient vanguard of the inevitable invasion from a
  hungering colony.

  Those headed into the deepest mines are advised to hire Horma Heftgrave (Medium, Lawful Evil
  [monsters]Warrior Veteran[/monsters]) an experienced dwarf guide, but Horma was secretly
  enthralled by [monsters]Mind Flayer;Mind Flayers[/monsters] and is now under a compulsion to bring
  fresh prey to her masters.

  Termalaine is divided by wide avenues planted with plentiful trees, bordered on the north and west
  by tall pines. Its buildings incorporate Calishite carvings of wizards, homunculi, tigers, and
  smiling djinn.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4de66696-c36a-4d62-89c8-c4dd9333a7b3">
  <strong><em>The Blue Clam.</em></strong> The fishers of Termalaine finish their days at the Blue
  Clam, sitting on benches near long hearths to warm their feet while they fill their bellies with
  spiced chowder. Beautiful works of scrimshaw hang on the walls. The Clam is the perfect place to
  listen for rumors, such as news of missing miners, or whispers that those who dig especially deep
  come back with a strange look in their eyes. The tavern’s orc owner and chef, Vernon Braig
  (Medium, Neutral Good [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]), is friendly with folks from Lonelywood and
  worries loudly about the strange goings-on up there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7c4af7d-05a0-4ace-a853-700b68fbb1b7">
  <strong><em>The Eastside.</em></strong> What looks from the outside like a group of separate
  houses is actually a single inn with rooms connected by underground passages and cozy guest
  accommodations in the cellar. The genteel human Marta Peskryk (Medium, Lawful Good
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]) inherited the Eastside inn from her father. She and Speaker Mazlu
  have an on-again, off-again relationship. Recently, guests in the deepest cellar rooms have
  complained to Marta about headaches and unsettling thoughts. Marta is unaware that her cellar sits
  at the edge of a psionic field (see

      <strong><em>Gem Mines.</em></strong> The upper three levels of the old tourmaline mine from
      which the town takes its name are well mapped and excavated, but the new, deeper mine openings
      have changed everything. The surrounding area now hosts a tent camp for prospectors, where
      mine boss Gulbrek the Wide (Neutral [monsters]Ogrillon Ogre[/monsters]) enforces law and order
      and breaks up frequent squabbles. The entrances and upper tunnels are crowded and noisy, and
      freshly built scaffolding and ropes descend into the quiet and ominous depths.

      <strong><em>Grand Row.</em></strong> New money in Termalaine has led to new construction. Old
      cabins were torn down to build the tall and gaudy houses of Grand Row, decorated with filigree
      and fine plantings for the town’s suddenly wealthy miners. This new gentry competes to
      outspend each other. Carts and sleds arrive regularly, loaded with expensive goods and
      furnishings from the south, and residents are considering hiring muscle to keep their houses
      safe from break-ins.

  Reghed Camps
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="199edd94-cd81-4f35-aaad-66fab56203a0">
  Reghed camps are scattered throughout Icewind Dale. None appear on maps because these nomads don’t
  stay in one place for long. A clan might set up its camp for a tenday or two, then dismantle it to
  follow reindeer migrating across the tundra. While clans of the same tribe build camps close to
  one another, the tribes avoid contact with each other unless a diplomatic summit is taking place.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f694bb97-d0e8-4398-96b8-4d7631d23eae">
  Camps typically consist of a chieftain; a great warrior who serves as adviser (such as a
  [monsters]Warrior Veteran[/monsters] or [monsters]Warrior Commander[/monsters]); a
  [monsters]Druid[/monsters] who wears a wooden mask of the clan’s sacred animal in public; and
  dozens of [monsters]Scout;Scouts[/monsters], [monsters]Warrior Infantry[/monsters], noncombatants
  such as children or elders, and sled dogs (use the [monsters]Wolf[/monsters] stat block). The dogs
  sleep with the warriors in an outer ring of small tents surrounding the chief’s circle, an inner
  ring of larger tents protected from the cold by thick fur blankets and the heat of the campfires.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cca919b9-1e9d-437d-beaa-20f453bd814f">
  A Reghed camp is somber and subdued, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of
  children playing. When at camp, warriors and hunters swap familiar stories and invent new ones
  that glorify the nomads’ outlook on life as they maintain their weapons and other combat gear.
  Noncombatants maintain the clan’s sleds, tents, and clothing and prepare food such as reindeer,
  seal, and knucklehead trout.

  The ruins of giant settlements are scattered throughout the wild and buried under the ice. The
  most famous of these is Jarlmoot, a silent circle of massive thrones to the west of
  <a href="#Bremen" data-content-chunk-id="88dd8a4e-2baa-4f26-a225-ac1f07dfa697">Bremen</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="3beade9e-937e-4aa3-8388-6fac5ce336f8">
  Stumbling across a giant ruin promises treasure and peril. The barrows of the giants hold magical
  items but also traps and giant Undead. Places of particular significance might be marked with
  glyphs of warding placed by giant rune wizards long ago. These ruins are often not truly
  abandoned—they are visited by [monsters]Frost Giant;Frost Giants[/monsters], who travel on the
  backs of [monsters]Mammoth;Mammoths[/monsters] while accompanied by leashed [monsters]Polar

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d7cc5d5-9fff-438f-866d-8aee3ecd93f9">
  Six steam vents have been mapped by Reghed and Ten-Towners, although everyone suspects more exist.
  Three of those are inaccessible, located in lakes or unreachable crags. The others rise from
  exposed rock and have become oases of heat and trade.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="515f9261-a94e-4606-8c32-57b21cce3f30">
  Ten-Towners, the Tribe of the Owl, and others cluster around the accessible vents. Sentries watch

<p data-content-chunk-id="5daafe04-2487-4082-a80a-909f6094f505">
  The closest steam vent to Ten-Towns has developed its own tent settlement. Highplume Station is a
  frontier village of about 150 adventurers, mercenaries, deep delvers, ruffians, the Tribe of the
  Owl, and guides. A few enterprising merchants do brisk business selling supplies at steep prices.

  No one formally is in charge of Highplume Station, but the shop of Geft Ardamar
  ([monsters]Aarakocra Aeromancer[/monsters]) serves as the station’s de facto court of law, with
  Geft handing down arbitrations quickly and more or less fairly (give or take a well-placed bribe).
  Geft is a daredevil explorer who ventures into the ruins at night.

  have mined the valley’s depths. Dwarf-carved tunnels run in rows along the valley’s walls,
  connected by narrow walkways. The heart of Kelvin’s Cairn lies beneath, deep in the tunnels and
  mines. Those who pick their way down the dizzying switchback called Daledrop find a strange
  mystery.

  Gone is the pervasive ringing of hammer strikes, replaced by an eerie silence. Adventurers
  exploring the valley see signs of unplanned departure—bowls of old stew molder on tables, blades
  rust on cold forges, and domesticated goats and badgers wander the halls in search of their former
  keepers. Those who investigate see signs of struggle, such as scraped boot prints from captives
  dragged off into the deeper tunnels.

<p data-content-chunk-id="8e6e82ca-bf1e-40f8-a248-b5890fac4d5a">
  The mines became the dwarves’ doom when they tunneled into the Underdark. Mind flayers infiltrated

  Rising from the desolate tundra of Icewind Dale is a mountain of giant boulders, piled one atop
  the other until they narrow to a snow-capped peak. Beasts hunt these craggy slopes, giants tread
  across the broken rills, and dwarf-hewn tunnels pierce its hidden depths. This is Kelvin’s Cairn,
  the heart of Icewind Dale and its highest point. Distances throughout the region are routinely
  measured from the mountain.

  Few explorers venture onto the mountain’s rocky slopes. No settlement has taken root there. The
  mountain’s face is home to wild beasts and yetis. Boastful adventurers who set out from Ten-Towns
  to bring back a yeti’s white pelt return with harrowing tales of being hunted across the

  At the eastern perimeter of Icewind Dale, the tundra meets the great Reghed Glacier. Reghed rarely
  venture to this bleak and barren area. Biting winds pour off the ice, and the glacier’s slow
  advance and retreat scours the earth of whatever life takes root here. Great earthen walls, left
  behind by the glacier, stand guard over empty tundra. Ancient giants used these walls to mark the

  through a single narrow pass on the Ten Trail. The mountains are famed for avalanches, beasts, and
  monstrosities. It was from here, in the fortress of Sunblight, that the duergar tyrant Xardarok
  unleashed the chardalyn dragon. A thriving goblin lair, Karkolohk, grows slowly but steadily where

  use “<a href="#RetakingtheTerror" data-content-chunk-id="30b9f9c2-dc49-4ab9-99e9-9201a81b76d6"
    >Retaking the Terror</a

<p data-content-chunk-id="5b3420be-540d-4175-9265-52e99dcd6679">
  <strong><em>Levels 5–10.</em></strong> Once Zlan knows of the party, it begins watching them from
  afar and directing its agents against them. The deep dragon Mornethraxys is one of Zlan’s pawns,
  and you can use “<a

    data-content-chunk-id="eddb085b-e279-4c59-8891-8d95100294cb"

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35be886e-9c61-49b8-91cb-bf9672a6b780">
  <strong><em>Levels 11–16.</em></strong> As contact between Icewind Dale and the Underdark
  increases, the characters become the only thing standing in the way of Zlan and its minions.
  They’ll need to overcome powerful aberrations freed from beneath the ice, the deep dragon
  Enderbalathal, and eventually Zlan itself. But even if Zlan is destroyed, the creature’s immortal
  body will return, with another of its seven minds in control.

  Vargrazt the Wretch.

  <strong><em>A Violent Rite.</em></strong> On their return to Easthaven, Vargrazt enters the Terror
  at sunset to perform the ritual. Vargrazt absorbs the chardalyn’s evil but destroys his own soul
  and becomes a violent [monsters]Wraith[/monsters].

  <strong><em>The Terror.</em></strong> Captain Imdra Arlaggath asks the characters to ensure the
  Terror is safe. It is the size of a small building, and half of it is buried below
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="753b4cb5-02f9-45e7-bd6f-38121fa61ef5">

  [monsters]Poltergeist[/monsters].

<p data-content-chunk-id="b2749f7c-47f1-46a4-bc43-7791f0500f28">
  <strong><em>Slime on the Walls.</em></strong> Arlaggath asks the characters to keep watch in the
  Terror overnight as a last precaution. During the night, three [monsters]Gray Ooze;Gray
  Oozes[/monsters] creep up a hidden passage from the Underdark and fight any living thing in the
  Terror.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4a8181d-dbec-492d-92c5-f084d5edbb09">
  <strong><em>Muck Monster.</em></strong> The oozes leave a path of slime to a hidden, locked
  trapdoor. The lock is Simple (1 action to pick) and of Good quality (DC 15). Below lies a pit of
  filth inhabited by an [monsters]Otyugh[/monsters]. The otyugh heaves itself up through the
  trapdoor, so characters above aren’t safe from its hunger.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3bb611d7-45c3-4ca1-9ccc-78f0e9be59de">
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> After the characters clear out the restless spirits and
  Underdark monsters infesting the dragon’s remains, Arlaggath entrusts the party with the Terror’s
  care, allowing them to convert it into a shared Bastion once they reach level 5. Vargrazt’s ritual
  absorbed the chardalyn’s power, rendering crystals inert and the Terror safe to inhabit. At your
  discretion, though, Zlan might still be able to monitor the characters while they’re in the
  chardalyn remains.
