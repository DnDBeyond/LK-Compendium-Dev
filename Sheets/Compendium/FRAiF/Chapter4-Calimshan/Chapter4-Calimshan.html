  <p class="fraif-dropcap">
    Calimshan, the Land of Wonders, is a rich realm that hides many secrets and fosters competing
    powers. Ancient lore lies buried here. Genie clans scheme and sabotage each other. Merchants,
    assassins, monsters, ancient relics, and cabals are as integral to Calimshan today as they are
    entwined in its history. Here, adventurers protect caravans traveling across the desert, quest
    for ancient mysteries, seek fame and fortune, collaborate with genies, and master potent magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calimshan is surrounded on three sides by water and relies on naval power for trade and
    security. Though desert takes up a third of its territory, Calimshan has many valuable
    resources. The forest of Mir grows cedar trees for shipbuilding. Quarries in the Marching
    Mountains mine precious stones. The seas provide pearls, seafood, and trade. At the center of
    everything is the fabulous city of Calimport, where people the world over come seeking rare
    goods, wealth, prestige, and opportunity. Calimport’s gleaming temples attract countless
    worshipers and pilgrims, and its libraries are among the greatest in Faerûn.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the highest authority within Calimshan is the ruling sultana, the most respected
    profession is that of a clever merchant. Calimshan relies on trade and innovation to maintain
    its status as one of the wealthiest and most inspiring nations in Faerûn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Magic is ever present in Calimshan, and many citizens know a spell or two. Genies have
    influenced life in Calimshan for centuries, and people dwelling in the desert, steppes, forests,
    and mountains of Calimshan rely on elemental magic to survive. Legends of genies further
    Calimshan’s reputation as a land of wishes and miracles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calimshan’s recent embrace of Mechanical Wonders—first imported from the island nation of Lantan
    and innovated on by Calishite artificers and crafters—has transformed life in Calimport. Made of
    porcelain, the lightest woods, delicate metal, and canvas, these devices are used for everything
    from transportation and war to civil engineering and household chores. They allow Calimport and
    other cities to solve magical problems without relying on the genies’ magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether visitors take the long trek across the Calim Desert or sail into Calimport’s walled
    harbor, they inevitably end up in the city’s bazaars. There, the breezy, melodic tongue of
    Alzhedo intermingles with languages from across the Realms. Dragonborn, gnomes, humans, and
    others barter over wondrous and mundane wares, negotiating the price of services big and small,
    licit and illicit.

  People of Calimshan
</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd07942f-58bb-4069-b1e5-f64f4944506b">
  The history of Calimshan reaches back almost ten thousand years. Epic poems describe the ancient
  forest of Keltomir inhabited by elves and giants, and detail how humans and dwarves found their
  way into this region. These tales recount the arrival and rise of the genies, describing their
  amazing feats, their many depredations, and their eventual fall.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a485606-505f-45e3-b86e-06a689d836b0">
  Calimshan’s diverse population includes aasimar, dwarves, elves, genies, humans, and tieflings. In
  recent decades, dragonborn and gnomes have become especially common and risen to influential
  positions in Calimport and the genie courts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="537f32c6-2319-457a-817b-e4fbdae33f87">
  Calishites typically wear light, loose-fitting clothes, with a flowing headscarf held in place
  with a leather cord or decorative headband. This distinctive style protects the wearer from
  Calimshan’s hot, arid environment. Calishites keep a traditional, curved dagger in their belt for
  utility and defense. The ornamentation and quality of the dagger, as well as how it is worn,
  indicates the wearer’s status and position.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a276e2cf-52f8-4713-8753-f347b751042d">
  Calishites work hard to eventually work less, and they go to great lengths to secure comfort and
  relaxation. But while Calimshan is entering a new era of prosperity, not all Calishites are
  wealthy. Many beggars in the cities go ignored by bustling Calishites seeking their own
  prosperity. Calishites often say, “Fools fall the hardest. The wise stand up again.”
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae621e44-b437-43ff-b446-959ffdf62e45">
  The people of Calimshan are wary of neighboring realms such as Tethyr; Calishites consider them
  failed imitators of Calimshan’s glory. Calishites appreciate the power and significance of other
  realms, but even the great city of Waterdeep is a newcomer compared to Calimshan’s long history.

  Hospitality
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="64399928-af78-4668-ad38-2c7ac4f9db3a">
  Hospitality is important in Calimshan—a tradition as important as any religious rite. Born from
  the need to survive in the harsh desert, hospitality ensures a traveler can expect food, drink,
  and shelter from a host in exchange for providing company in an isolated environment. Hosts
  prepare kaethae, a hot beverage brewed from ground beans, and bastik kaktos, a delicacy made of
  the native Calim cactus.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="130d1e05-0b4f-467b-9c33-622aa1f91701">
  However, the code of hospitality also implies guests should refrain from excess, and hospitality
  technically extends only to the home, tent, or camp. Wise guests refrain from impolite behavior
  and don’t take advantage of their host; they know a troublemaking guest can be targeted for
  retribution as soon as they’re outside the tent flap.

  Kochar
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79d9fafb-f0fc-41d3-bef9-597607343210">
  Much of Calishite culture—whether in the steppes, desert, or cities—is based around the traditions
  of Kochar, primarily human nomads who are scattered across Calimshan. Kochar have a strong culture
  of art, music, and dance, as well as an oral tradition recounting thousands of years of
  Calimshan’s history. Kochar customs can be found in every Calishite city.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c983266c-8cdf-47e4-a6c7-4ae10eb0f5e7">
  Kochar travel great distances each year to sustain herds of horses, goats, and cattle on the
  sparse steppe grasses. The nomads know the

  oases, hazards, and landmarks. Each year, tribes gather in temporary tent cities to trade, share
  tales, engage in ceremonies, and set prices before venturing into the cities to sell their wares.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff0ad4cd-b0d2-47e7-81ce-3d684e3c690c">
  A common Kochar saying is “I am against my brother, my brother and I are against my cousin, and my
  cousin and I are against the stranger.” This saying illustrates the hierarchy of loyalties and
  trust among Kochar. They consider other tribes outside their own to be cousins and those who are
  outside the tribes to be strangers. This is the heart of the Calishite ability to compete
  internally while uniting against a common foe.

  The Sultana’s Reign
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c82e2f19-4cd8-4553-99d2-a427f0613288">
  Calimshan has always been a place of fantastic magic, and for centuries genie overlords wielded
  that magic to rule over mortal servants. Even after the genies were overthrown, the rulers of
  Calimshan maintained the social structure imposed by the genies, albeit with themselves as rulers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5378121a-c9d1-44c4-8726-0b2aa0171b9f">
  But a generation ago, Syl-Pasha Zengel rose to the throne. He discovered that a cabal of
  necromancers known as the Twisted Rune had been secretly directing Calimshan’s fate for centuries.
  While Zengel sought out a powerful weapon to destroy the Twisted Rune, the cabal used the lure of
  arcane and royal power to convince Zengel’s fourth son to assassinate him and the rest of the
  royal family. Only Zengel’s fourth daughter, the young wizard Songal, escaped. With the aid of
  genies and her father’s magic ring, Songal traveled to the floating towers of
  <a href="#MagisTor" data-content-chunk-id="fed1f7fe-d9d1-4ae3-a26d-d40b8c201fb8">Magis Tor</a>,
  where she claimed the <em>Staff of Life and Death</em>, a relic sacred to Kelemvor. She assembled
  an army of dragonborn and shattered the power of the Twisted Rune in an evening called the Night
  of Fleeing Shadows.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b4814cd-f195-44e9-b883-e1ed0e612c29">
  After claiming the position of sultana, Songal outlawed slavery in Calimshan, enacted many popular
  reforms, and initiated building projects throughout the realm. She named a chief adviser, assisted
  by a council of lesser advisers. Over the years, dissatisfied nobles backed by foreign powers have
  rebelled, but Sultana Songal has defeated each such effort, emerging stronger than before.

<p data-content-chunk-id="efa43b20-a04b-4d22-826c-37aebdb38393">
  Dragonborn were excluded from power in Calimshan by genies who viewed dragons as rivals. But
  dragonborn have long formed small communities or monasteries in Calimshan or traveled with or
  joined the Kochar.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1640ea08-5b87-4ff3-9f70-a31cc439611a">
  During Sultana Songal’s rise to power, many dragonborn rallied to her banner. On the Night of
  Fleeing Shadows, Songal’s genie allies magically transported her dragonborn guard into the city,
  and the guard destroyed a dracolich that was one of the Twisted Rune’s leaders.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f72b8352-0a95-465a-b158-d590f9c2e350">
  Many dragonborn died for their kingdom and their sultana. In recognition of their loyalty and
  strength, Songal elevated some dragonborn to positions of power in Calimshan. Other dragonborn
  have since gravitated to genie strongholds, where they combine their innate powers with elemental
  magic.

      Those empires collapsed long ago, but genies linger here nonetheless. When Songal rose to

  Each genie settlement in Calimshan is ruled by a few noble genies with the power to grant wishes,
  assisted by dozens of genies of lesser power who hold important offices. Elemental magic is
  everywhere in these settlements, mimicking the conditions of the Elemental Plane from which the
  genies come. Many citizens of these cities are native to other planes or have special abilities
  that make them well suited to the unique environment of a genie palace. For example, the sandy
  streets of Gozva Ka are crowded with azers, infernal tieflings, and dragonborn with a brass, gold,
  or red heritage, all of whom easily tolerate the city’s extreme heat.

  The genie factions reluctantly acknowledge the supremacy of Sultana Songal. They largely avoid
  Calimport and don’t interfere with the sultana’s agenda. Instead, they scheme against each other.
  They hire spies in the courts of their rivals, enrich their fabulous palaces in contests of
  extravagance, and humiliate each other in sporting and social events. Sometimes these rivalries
  spawn lightning-fast raids of extraordinary violence, but genies refrain from all-out war. Any
  serious disruption of daily life in Calimshan by a genie faction would draw the sultana’s ire, and
  she could bring three genie factions together to ruin the other.

  As genies returned to Calimshan, Sultana Songal felt her power threatened by genies’ magic, which
  tamed the heat of the desert, brought forth water, conjured the world’s richest treasures, and
  controlled the weather. Songal felt that, for her dynasty to survive, the people of Calimshan
  needed to be able to solve problems both magical and mundane without resorting to genies’ magic.
  She found the solution in the imagination of a brilliant gnome inventor named Deryan Kaya.

  The Great Inventor
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08687f29-0be3-4c84-bb35-206b2d6eb35c">
  Deryan Kaya is a gnome inventor, artist, musician, and polymath. Although she studied under some
  of the greatest minds in Faerûn, including technologists from the nearby island nation of Lantan,
  she primarily taught herself through extensive research and tireless experimentation. A relentless
  optimist, she dreamed of a future made better by advances in magic and science.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d061bfbd-eb13-4feb-8293-8efb8a34c9ba">
  Deryan envisioned a world where ordinary people could rely on machines to solve everyday problems,
  where citizens of Calimshan were freed from repetitive labor and dangerous tasks. In the world of
  Deryan’s imagination, magical machines handled life’s drudgery, leaving every individual free to
  pursue a life of creativity, education, and personal enrichment.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d98845be-8b74-4b19-a1cc-aaca84470624">
  But such miraculous machines wouldn’t invent themselves. Deryan had designs, but she didn’t have
  the time, wealth, and workshop required to make these dreams a reality. This, however, is exactly
  what the sultana offered to provide.

  The First Wonders
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01e19312-6798-40b3-86b1-bbe93aaac707">
  Songal set Deryan up with a workshop, assistants, and the raw materials and tools she required.
  Deryan and her team presented the first prototype [magicitems]Mechanical Wonder[/magicitems]—a
  human-shaped construct she named Ado—at the sultana’s court a year later. Ado was a machine
  animated by magic: made of the lightest wood, its limbs connected with delicate silver joints, and
  its porcelain head adorned with lamp-like eyes. Ado couldn’t speak, but it could obey
  instructions, delighting the sultana with simple antics like running in place, juggling, and
  counting on its fingers. When one of the sultana’s courtiers nearly choked on a plum pit, Ado
  wrapped its arms around the choking victim, gave a short and sudden embrace, and popped the pit
  onto the table.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="468b5af5-a142-4ca1-ac06-c6a1ae98a6c7">
  Ado’s debut was explosive. Within weeks, rival workshops organized to copy and improve on Deryan’s
  innovation. Within a few years, countless varieties of <em>Mechanical Wonders</em> were available,
  primarily in Calimport but slowly spreading to other cities in the realm. In addition to humanlike
  wonders like Ado, inventors designed small flying wonders capable of delivering mail and other
  packages, household machines to perform chores like cleaning and yard maintenance, and wonders
  that assist disabled citizens, replacing lost eyes or enhancing mobility.

  When a citizen of Calimport needs groceries, they clip a list of the necessary items to a wind-up
  drone, give it directions to the market stall, and leave payment in an attached basket. The
  wonder’s corkscrew rotor flies it to the grocer, who reads the list, collects their fee, loads the
  basket, and sends it back home. [magicitems]Mechanical Wonder;Mechanical Wonders[/magicitems] do
  laundry, change bedsheets, walk pets, and perform manual labor. Calishites with disabilities might

  Many wonders are surprisingly affordable, their prices kept low through fierce competition between
  rival workshops. Sultana Songal gives away assistive wonders for free. Conversely, Calimport’s
  wealthiest citizens are always looking for ways to conspicuously display their wealth for everyone
  to see, and some of them have commissioned workshops to build fantastic submersibles, flying
  machines, and other novelties, but such inventions are beyond the reach of most Calishites. The
  sultana’s military has deep pockets, and her generals supplement the army and navy with mechanical
  soldiers and mounts known as

  <p>Lightning Sand</p>
  <p>
    When the magical lightning of the <a href="#CalimDesert">Calim Desert</a> strikes sand, it melts
    the sand into an elaborate lightning-like shape made of glass. These objects, known as
    “lightning sand,” lie buried in the sand after the strike to be unearthed by explorers and
    treasure hunters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Merchants in the bazaars of Calimport grade pieces of lightning sand on their clarity, shape,
    and magical luminescence. A small and cloudy piece of lightning sand with no branches is
    equivalent to a 10 GP gemstone; a larger, clearer specimen with many branches shimmering with
    light is worth as much as a 5,000 GP gemstone.

  Calimshan Gazetteer
</h2>
<aside class="aside--gazetteer-overview">
  <p>
    Calimshan is a land shaped by magical struggle. The mighty genies Calim and Memnon might be
    gone, but they’ve left behind blistering deserts, towering mountains, and impenetrable forests.
    Genies continue to dwell here, and many mortals rely on genies’ magic and patronage to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over thousands of years, the people of Calimshan have adapted to life in this land. Brilliant
    cities have been built in the fertile lands along the sea, and the steppe nomads known as
    <a href="#Kochar">Kochar</a> continue to live as they always have, observing strict traditions
    that help them survive a dangerous realm.
  </p>
  <p>Calimshan can be broadly divided into five geographical regions:</p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="#NorthernBorder">Northern Border.</a></strong> Fortresses line the Tethyrian

  Northern Border
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="868accee-aa14-4954-a549-f16cde87c830">
  Calimshan shares its northern border with the realm of Tethyr. Another of the so-called Lands of
  Intrigue, Tethyr is famous for royal backstabbing and conspiratorial plots. The sultana deters
  military aggression from Tethyr with a line of strong fortresses well garrisoned with experienced
  troops. To the west, Memnon is a major hub of trade.

<p data-content-chunk-id="e46448c2-e100-4acc-9764-4ab02b667756">
  Also known as Memnonnar Citadel, Fort Agis sits north of the Agis River. Hundreds of
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] and a dozen [monsters]Mage;Mages[/monsters] maintain this post.
  Always watchful for activity from both Tethyr and the ruins of Memnonnar, this fortress is key to
  Calimshan’s defense.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d52f812-cbf0-4763-815e-087c744c330e">
  Blue and brass dragons emerge from the desert or the ruins of Memnonnar to harass caravans
  traveling to or from Fort Agis. The fort’s cautious human commander, Najm Saleh (Medium, Chaotic
  Good [monsters]Spy Master[/monsters]), is seeking solutions that won’t compromise the fort’s
  security.

  Fort Calim
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc57dcb8-cafe-4395-b4f2-bf6079e38d60">
  Fort Calim, built on the ruin of an ancient dwarven fortress, keeps a garrison similar to that of
  Fort Agis. Recent excavations have revealed an extensive, unexplored complex below the fort. The
  increased activity prompted Tethyr to gather troops along the border, complicating the exploration
  effort. The fort’s dragonborn commander, Gujlat Sabi (Medium, Lawful Evil [monsters]Warrior
  Veteran[/monsters]), is a brooding and calculating commander with a hatred of Tethyr.
</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Memnon" data-content-chunk-id="35c6b955-c9c6-4ec8-ae52-f7f2d9252f25">
  Memnon
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c3905a8a-27c7-4781-a965-2d1f05b4fe1d">
  Memnon has many names: the City of Soldiers, the Desert’s Gateway, and the Scarlet City.
  Originally the capital of the efreeti Memnon’s empire, the city has been ruled by mortals for over
  six thousand years. A key port, it has been destroyed by invaders several times, but each time,
  rulers of Calimshan have rebuilt atop the ruins. Now, the city sits atop a low hill overlooking
  the Agis River.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4640dedf-2134-4238-9e25-5b36db10f0f3">
  <strong><em>Architecture.</em></strong> Nearly all the city’s structures are built with
  distinctive red bricks made from mud found along the river. The door to each home and business is
  painted a single color to convey status or profession. For example, a red door is found at inns
  and taverns; while merchants use a yellow door; and a blue door indicates various services such as
  lawyer, scribe, or sage. Purple is reserved for magical occupations. Healing facilities use green
  doors.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ab8d183-9350-49bd-8bd3-d7888f4bd985">
  <strong><em>Harbor.</em></strong> The city’s fortified harbor has grown significantly over the
  last century, supplying food and imported luxuries to Calimshan’s growing population. Two dozen
  ships from the sultana’s armada anchor within Memnon’s artificial harbor, whose stone walls extend
  from the river’s bottom to ten feet above the waterline. The city’s original harbor supports
  merchant vessels, while docks for local fishers extend in both directions along the city’s
  shoreline.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="543ea8e7-f1ce-4723-8832-5150ad0e0ebc">
  <strong><em>Travel Hub.</em></strong> Caravans traveling to Calimport pause at Memnon to rest and
  prepare for the grueling journey across the
  <a href="#CalimDesert" data-content-chunk-id="73807320-bcba-49be-9e7f-0aeca945c517"
    >Calim Desert</a
  >. Crews sail their vessels here to relax, trade, and resupply, even if they plan to continue to
  Calimport.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d721301f-8376-404f-b91f-76cd82a9dccb">
  Memnon is a hub for mercenaries, explorers, and other adventurers. The Order of the Gauntlet
  maintains a stout keep here, providing lodging for honorable warriors seeking work. The Trade
  Quarter fills a third of the city. During peak caravan seasons, visitors overflow the quarter,
  with many instead staying in tents outside the city at the base of its hill. Memnon’s inns,
  taverns, and other entertainments are legendary among sailors and caravans.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00a66a2a-5377-4ff4-aa28-c6c296353d26">
  Here, visitors to Calimshan can see [magicitems]Mechanical Wonder;Mechanical Wonders[/magicitems]
  for the first time. There are mechanical bridges, clockwork messengers, and machines washing
  clothes at inns. Nimblewright soldiers stand attentively alongside humanoid guards at every city
  gate. Flying wonders patrol the harbor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="807ee921-4dac-44f6-900b-a5f9f8b7ebd5">
  With so many travelers in the city, crime in the Trade Quarter can be rampant. As long as
  disturbances don’t disrupt the flow of trade or spill over into other parts of the city, the city
  guard lets visitors settle matters among themselves. Disruption to trade or the tranquility of the
  city, however, is met with swift and severe justice.

<p data-content-chunk-id="a39e1cca-42bc-4fe2-a2c7-eb472e56f10c">
  Ruins opposite Memnon across the Agis River are all that remains of the capital of the ancient
  kingdom of Memnonnar. [monsters]Fire Elemental;Fire Elementals[/monsters] and mephits roam the
  ruins, the stones of which are supernaturally warm. Efreet came to Memnonnar from the Plane of
  Fire through a portal deep beneath these ruins, and the many treasure seekers who frequent the
  site insist that the portal is active.

  The Calim Desert was created by accident as a side effect of the tremendous magic used to imprison

  Unstable magic plagues this land; rain rarely falls here and sandstorms arise suddenly.

</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="558759e5-3617-440b-a45f-f3ee91757344">
  Deep within the Calim Desert is the efreeti stronghold Gozva Ka, the Shimmering Oasis. Emulating
  the City of Brass, it’s a place of scorching splendor. The city’s polished stone walls and towers,
  standing over one hundred feet tall, brilliantly reflect the relentless sun. Domed roofs, adorned
  with intricate metalwork, crown nearly every structure.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1221216e-b110-4bc0-a25e-950262df8a37">
  The city is protected by powerful illusions and genies’ magic; most travelers pass within a
  handbreadth of its walls and never know it is there. Only those invited into the city by Jaham
  ([monsters]Efreeti[/monsters])—the calculating ruler of Gozva Ka—or his council of elder efreeti
  advisers can pierce this magical veil.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc775e20-1a59-4dcb-be70-55e9fa6b4f4f">
  The efreet of Gozva Ka plot against other genie clans and craft weapons, metalwork, and magic
  items. They encourage the use of fire magic among non-genies and gladly trade dangerous magic
  items to others, particularly those not wise enough to wield such items safely. Many creatures
  that thrive in desert heat dwell and work within the city, including azers, dragonborn, goliaths,
  and salamanders. Dwarves live there too, drawn by the opportunity to work at efreeti forges.

  Commanded by the [monsters]Efreeti[/monsters] Narlahib, the floating fortress of Miziltep
  symbolizes the height of genie power. Its black, metal walls surround six towers, and the entire
  structure drifts where the efreeti commands. Narlahib is loyal to both the sultana and Jaham,
  ruler of Gozva Ka—a position that becomes uncomfortable when those two mighty individuals don’t
  agree.

  Trade Way
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7cad067-ee11-4cc0-bbab-277908366cc3">
  The Trade Way is an ancient highway of enchanted stone running from Memnon in the north to
  Calimport in the south. Tall, slender spires used to mark the edge of the highway. A few of these
  spires still glow with a calm, blue light at night, but most have been buried by the desert or
  reduced to rubble. The Trade Way is the most direct route across the desert and is preferred by
  most caravans. However, there are few oases along the Trade Way, and travelers are frequently
  accosted by mischievous fey or raiders.

  Central Steppes
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96e7ee99-dcc1-404c-824d-407eda19ac9b">
  Calimshan’s Central Steppes are vast stretches of dry land where only the hardiest scrub brush and
  grasses grow. While natural springs and oases dot the land, locating them can be challenging for
  anyone unfamiliar with the harsh terrain. In addition to the lack of natural resources, this wild
  territory contain numerous dangers, including blue dragons and desert-dwelling wolves.

  <a href="#Kochar" data-content-chunk-id="dc16ef35-4031-4d4b-bbb9-d1b152621fd6">Kochar</a> nomads
  are the undisputed masters of this region. Before Sultana Songal took the throne, she had already
  spent time among Kochar, knowing they were a powerful force within Calimshan. As Songal solidified
  her rule, she met with considerable resistance from Kochar elders who resisted her authority. But
  the majority of the tribes saw value in the security and favorable trade agreements an alliance
  with the sultana offered.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26ad5704-b6ef-47bc-b350-4c0483a3a174">
  Traditionally, each tribe was ruled by a chieftain, but for practical reasons Sultana Songal
  convinced the tribes to select a single ruler who represents the Kochar in court, while the
  chieftains became a council of advisers for the ruler. Each ruler serves only for five years, and
  the position rotates among the advisers, ensuring no one tribe dominates the others.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a6b68c0-be56-4d75-8f7a-dbda92a10cfc">
  While the alliance has greatly improved trade across Calimshan, some Kochar still raid caravans or
  ignore Songal’s edicts. Nevertheless, 20,000 Kochar riders answered Songal’s call when a horde of
  goblins spilled out of the Marching Mountains in 1493 DR.

<p data-content-chunk-id="3afd0397-345b-414e-803a-613694bba676">
  Known as the City at the Edge of the Desert, Keltar is the largest city in Calimshan by area,
  straddling the Calim River. Waterwheels lining the shore power mills and industry, while
  irrigation networks support local farming. Three wide bridges connect the predominantly
  residential West Keltar with commercial East Keltar. West Keltar is full of two-story stone and
  mud-brick architecture, while East Keltar is a sprawling complex of animal pens, slaughterhouses,
  and tanneries separated by low walls and fences.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf9e6d21-06c4-42cb-8f81-bb1fd48380f7">
  The tanneries are odorous—some caravanners claim they smell Keltar from a day away—but very
  profitable. Leatherworkers in Keltar are among the best in Faerûn. The sultana’s knights ride on
  Keltari saddles. The city’s industries also make it a bustling trade hub for the tribes living in
  western portion of the steppes, who bring their herds of cattle and goats to the city for
  slaughter.

  strike out into the desert. Within the city, powerful merchant families, guilds, and criminal
  networks compete for wealth and influence.

  Located on Calimshan’s eastern border, the city of Almraiven hosts the shipyard for the sultana’s
  navy and merchant vessels, which relies on cedar from the Forest of Mir and cypress from the
  Spider Swamp. Although the city has a governor, the sultana’s admiral has authority over naval
  matters.

<p data-content-chunk-id="12fa6430-9271-465d-a0e1-84bce15368a8">
  Much of the swampland surrounding the city has been drained for farmland, but that’s not enough to
  feed Almraiven’s growing population, which still imports much of its food—as well as expensive
  Mulhorandi spices favored by so many in the city.

  is used to create [magicitems]Carpet of Flying;Carpets of Flying[/magicitems] and other magic
  textiles. Few know the silk is produced by [monsters]Aranea;Araneas[/monsters]—shape-shifting
  spider people. A few aranea merchants deal in this rare silk and protect its secret.

  bring livestock here for trade. Live animals are loaded onto ships to provide fresh meat during
  voyages or to sell in far-off ports. Camels, cattle, chickens, goats, wild prey, and even
  elephants can be purchased in Manshaka.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5afe8bb-28a5-45b7-a839-ad57b566b586">
  Manshaka boasts the largest arena in Calimshan, the Colosseum Triumphant, which hosts races of all
  types, sports matches, gladiatorial events, wizard duels, plays, and reenactments. Each winter,
  teams from across the realms compete in the Tournament of Legends for powerful magical pearls
  awarded by the ruler. The population of the city doubles in the weeks prior to the tournament.

<p data-content-chunk-id="9eac2237-3611-47b8-9051-f4588e655ad1">
  Anyone can gamble on anything in Manshaka, and verbal contracts are considered legally binding.
  Local nobles and merchants hire scribes to follow them and record their dealings, as the crime of
  false witness is severely punished.

  Manshaka merchants invest in high-risk caravans and businesses, but their terms can be severe. The
  Pearled Blades are assassins who enforce such contracts; they’re infamous for traveling throughout
  Faerûn to collect a debt payment.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f50cfbf4-be93-41ab-933b-bc2e0b93ae24">
  Historically, many of Manshaka’s leaders have run afoul of such assassins. To correct this,
  Sultana Songal has appointed the silver dragonborn Irada (Medium [monsters]Noble
  Prodigy[/monsters]) to oversee the city as master of merchants. Irada quickly gained a reputation
  for fairness, survivability, and stone-cold retribution against would-be assassins. The city’s
  most prominent merchants and nobles serve as her council. So far, her neutrality and the elite
  guard at her command have brought stability to the otherwise chaotic city.

  Maran Saya’s buildings are made from magically hardened coral and stone from the seafloor. The
  city, which surfaces or submerges at the whim of its ruler, is a three-dimensional labyrinth of
  causeways and tunnels. Flowing currents swiftly propel inhabitants and goods throughout the city

  While the Coral Palace is inhabited by merfolk, sahuagin, and other aquatic creatures, relatively
  few air-breathing people live there. Air-filled chambers are provided for residents and guests who
  can’t breathe underwater, and they survive the city’s crushing depths by magic or the occasional

  Necropolis of Nykkar. Sultana Songal gathered thousands of engineers and spellcasters to construct
  a harbor and fortress on the north end of the isle, then a broad, paved avenue to the isle’s
  interior, and finally the necropolis itself. Thanks to magical assistance, the crew completed the
  project in a year. Hundreds of soldiers, knights, and warrior-monks—all dedicated to
  Kelemvor—defend the necropolis, fortress, and road.

  Calimport Gazetteer
</h2>
<aside class="aside--gazetteer-overview">
  <p>
    Calimport is the oldest, and by many measures the greatest, city in Faerûn. A nexus of trade,
    culture, and sophistication, it has gained even more prominence in recent years with the rise of
    Sultana Songal and her patronage of the city’s inventors and artificers. Citizens of Calimport
    now rely on Mechanical Wonders to solve their daily problems, instead of seeking the patronage
    of capricious genies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visitors from across Faerûn—and indeed from planes and worlds throughout the multiverse—crowd
    the streets and markets of Calimport. Genies are allowed to enter only if they swear an oath of
    obedience and nonviolence to the sultana.
  </p>
  <p>The city is divided into a few distinct sections:</p>
  <ul class="list--hidden">
    <p>
      <strong>Docks and Seawall.</strong> Calimport’s docks house the sultana’s navy as well as
      countless trade vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Calimport Wards.</strong> The city is divided into seventeen distinct neighborhoods,

</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2cf7e4b6-cdf5-4c9e-961b-ac00270af616">
  Calimport’s harbor is vital to the city’s prosperity. The colossal seawall protecting the harbor
  was constructed long ago by genies. The wall rises 20 feet above sea level and is 30 feet thick at
  its summit; its base reaches down more than 200 feet to the harbor bottom and gradually widens to
  150 feet thick. Fortified garrison houses line the top of the wall, while gatehouses can close the
  harbor with heavy steel chains.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c63092fd-fbba-4d2a-9326-37127186aca5">
  The harbor handles hundreds of vessels at a time and is divided into several sections. The Armada
  Ward houses the sultana’s navy, the Dock Ward handles commercial shipping, the Harvest Ward
  services fishing ships and other local traffic, and the Hook Ward is for shipbuilding.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98841813-24c5-47ac-b32b-acf879864ed0">
  By a decree of the sultana, ships docking in Calimport are expected to hand over books, scrolls,
  or other written material; only personal correspondence and business records are exempt. If the
  Grand Library doesn’t have a copy of the book or scroll, the manuscript is copied, and documents
  are eventually returned. The Grand Library’s scribes work with magical assistance, but it’s not
  unusual for ships to be delayed in port as their passengers wait for books to be returned.

  Armada Ward
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="504585cd-e992-4c42-b865-2379994899c3">
  The Armada Ward contains garrisons, armories, and warehouses supplying Calimport’s navy, the
  Nallojal. Only military vessels are allowed to use the harbor here. Security is tighter than in
  most other wards, and officials watch for foreign spies and saboteurs. Unless a person has
  official business or direct connections with a high government official, they are generally not
  permitted entrance.

  thick. Both doors bear the symbol of the sultana: two crossed scimitars under a gold coin.
  Although each door weighs over 150 tons, their design is so perfect they can be opened or closed
  by a single person. Mounted knights patrol along the Trade Way for many miles beyond Calimport,
  accompanied by the Zeraphi, an elite force of spellcasting warriors on flying carpets. A garrison
  of city guards watches the gate, supported by large and imposing

<p data-content-chunk-id="d69fdf2a-512d-4a86-bdd5-8eabe7cc7c4b">
  Following tradition, gate guards greet everyone who enters the city and give them water.
  Everything surrounding the Caravan Gate conveys the strength, power, and hospitality of Calimport.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41b423f9-dd82-4441-80ed-a282b22e3877">
  Inside the gates, the Caravan Ward is dusty and crowded with beasts of burden, tents, and
  travelers. The bureaucracy managing the Caravan Ward is extensive, running offices, inns, taverns,
  and shops that cater to visitors.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa06ae29-663d-4181-8e58-1a3dcc0dc74d">
  In addition to permanent auction houses and bazaars, impromptu markets and auctions spring up in
  minutes, only to disappear as soon as coins and goods have been exchanged. Most goods here make
  their way to the Grand Ward before spreading throughout the city.

  The Dock Ward is known in Calimport as the Ward That Never Sleeps, and this ward has more taverns,
  inns, and warehouses than anywhere else in the city. Inside the protective seawall, dockworkers
  labor day and night, offloading and loading ships.

<p data-content-chunk-id="5424de26-b2ac-4c8b-88ad-73e44f78a2fe">
  This ward’s tall, vibrantly colored, ornately decorated, and domed buildings are one of the first
  signs of Calimport’s magnificence when visitors approach the city from the north. The Emerald
  Ward’s proximity to the Caravan Ward makes it convenient for affluent merchants, and this is home
  to many of Calimport’s social climbers.

<p data-content-chunk-id="301ad827-b6e6-47a4-8290-dcc8360b91e7">
  Trade is the heart of Calimport, and the Grand Ward is the epitome of trade. The Grand Ward
  connects to most wards in the city and has more shops and markets than the others. Items from all
  over Faerûn can be found here, particularly in the Grand Bazaar: a marvel of commerce embracing
  multiple city blocks filled with wide, open buildings topped by domes and decorated with arches.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eeb2261a-847a-45e1-9cf2-39226e38fd34">
  Local and traveling merchants rent space in the Grand Ward to sell their wares. Merchants lay down
  carpets or erect open tents to sell textiles, glassware, spices, imported food, magic items, and
  much more. The wealth of goods and bustling crowds of people make this a paradise for merchants,
  buyers, and pickpockets.

  The Hammer Ward is the home of Calimport’s armorers, blacksmiths, and weaponsmiths. Every day, the
  ringing of hammers can be heard throughout the ward. Neighborhoods within the Hammer Ward are
  patrolled by their guilds, and the guildhalls are fortified armories. The most outstanding
  features of this ward are its two massive foundries, which produce the finest steel in Faerûn.

<p data-content-chunk-id="94410c04-a65a-492e-b38a-a568a6fbecfd">
  This ward harbors the city’s many fishing vessels. As the number of trade ships has grown, the
  walls of the Harvest Ward have extended to accommodate smaller local vessels. Besides the harbor,
  the Harvest Ward contains numerous granaries and supply warehouses for the city. The Ward’s
  easternmost edge contains a live animal market and pens for newly arrived livestock.

  Hill Ward
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b7b7aa1-1af5-4317-959d-4a825166b132">
  The Hill Ward used to be known as the Crypt Ward, and it housed the city’s dead. But after
  millennia of burials, there was no more room and most of those buried here were long forgotten. To
  create space for new graves, dirt was piled atop older burials. During Calimport’s infrequent
  storms, bones would wash into the streets.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4cb14647-6f84-4e01-b524-6aa831997e9c">
  After consultation with the church of Kelemvor, Sultana Songal established the
  <a href="#FirstNecropolisofNykkar" data-content-chunk-id="f7fa7384-0e90-47d5-ab1f-0c009571f52b"
    >Necropolis of Nykkar</a
  >
  on the Isle of Memory and ordered the Crypt Ward to be repurposed. Priests of Kelemvor supervised
  the exhumation, identification, and transport of millennia of Calimport’s dead onto black ships
  that carried them to Nykkar. These ships, the Death Fleet of Kelemvor, continue their mission
  today, serving the city’s newly dead.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef496698-c7f9-42c1-9515-9d1f382931b1">
  Now the Hill Ward is a home for Calimport’s working class, who have filled the old ward with tall
  buildings, broad streets, and markets. The Hill Ward’s high elevation means the people here live
  above the wealthy elite of other districts—a fact locals credit to the sultana, whom they revere
  as a hero of the working class.

  The Hook Ward contains Calimport’s shipyards and associated warehouses. The navigators’,
  seafarers’, and shipwrights’ guildhalls are within the Hook Ward. Because some of the shipyards
  specialize in military vessels for the sultana’s navy, the Hook Ward also has a strong military
  presence.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c297b3f-40c8-4781-9328-d5a0cfded373">
  Temples and shrines dedicated to numerous deities of the seas, including Umberlee and Talos, can
  be found in the Hook Ward. Sailors visit these shrines in an attempt to soothe these temperamental
  deities. Priests at these temples heal wounds, remove curses, and sell Holy Water.

  The Jewel Ward is home to Calimport’s gem cutters, jewelers, perfumers, lace makers, and high
  fashion designers. Some of the most delicate [magicitems]Mechanical Wonder;Mechanical

  A khanduq is a small, walled market at the center of a city district, and the Khanduq Ward boasts
  many such markets. The homes that surround these markets belong to the city’s less affluent
  crafters and merchants, and the bottom floor or two is usually reserved for a workshop or
  storefront. The streets of the Khanduq Ward are narrow, bustling, and crammed with makeshift
  stalls.

  The Maker’s Ward is home to skilled crafters, artificers, and makers of the city’s
  <em>Mechanical Wonders</em>. The ward houses a significant gnome population. The sultana regularly
  tours the workshops of the Maker’s Ward, reviewing the latest innovations and selecting some for
  military use or special placement within her palace.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a16a19d4-5350-4a0a-b30d-427622e3d290">
  The ruler of the Maker’s Ward is a rock gnome named Deryan Kaya. A larger-than-life figure among
  Calimshan’s artisans, merchants, and nobles, Deryan can’t walk down the street without being
  recognized and interrupted by passersby, so she usually travels over the city in an ornithopter of
  her own design.

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae7b8b83-39f5-4adc-b225-fbc275bf9969">
  Taverns and bathhouses in the Palace Ward serve as gathering spots for the city’s elite, while
  theaters provide entertainment. Important visitors and mercenaries hired to protect nobles stay in
  the ward’s luxurious inns. City servants and <em>Mechanical Wonders</em> sweep the streets clean
  from the dust that blows in from the

  The Palace Primordial stands among the ward’s most opulent buildings. This magnificent structure
  hosts visiting genies and their retinue. Its chambers have been magically altered to suit the
  preferences of genies of all sorts, but the sultana’s spies have allegedly infiltrated the palace
  staff.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffa36f08-2eff-47bd-acbc-a1e2f039610c">
  The sultana’s palace complex sits high atop the mesa at the heart of the Palace Ward, above all
  but the Hill Ward. Luxurious gardens surround the enormous, white-domed palace, which is visible
  from anywhere in the city. Ambassadors from the Lords’ Alliance and Purple Dragon Knights have
  permanent quarters in the complex. In an emergency, the palace can be sealed off from the rest of
  the city and further protected by layers of magical wards. Wells and gardens provide food and
  water. The palace and its gardens are well protected by the Dragon Guard.

  Calimport’s prodigious papermaking and bookbinding industry is centered in the Quill Ward. The
  most prominent feature of the ward is the Grand Library, located atop a hill at the ward’s eastern
  end. The head of acquisitions at the Grand Library is an [monsters]Efreeti[/monsters] scholar
  named Azriq, who has a perfect memory and can recall the name and location of every manuscript the
  library contains. A trusted adviser to Sultana Songal, he dreams of reading every book in Faerûn,
  and he’s the only genie in Calimport not required to swear the Sultana’s oath.

  Many of the buildings within this ward, including the Grand Library, are magically protected

  In the center of the ward is a magically sustained lake used to water the army’s mounts. An
  expansive training ground surrounds the lake. But the real landmark floats over the lake: the Sky

  Calimport’s largest and grandest temples and shrines are located in the Temple Ward. Various
  faiths attempt to outdo each other in the magnificence of their holy places, using precious metal,

  Calimport, although the worship of a few evil deities is banned, prompting their followers in the

  While many Calishites know a spell or two, any serious practitioner of arcane magic wishing to
  conduct business in the city must join the Guild Arcane and pay annual dues. This includes
  students and faculty at the ward’s many magical academies. The guild sets the price for arcane
  services and magical items and ensures all transactions are carried out safely and according to

  The heads of the magical academies report to the ward’s ruler. Every five years, they present a

  adviser from among these candidates. The current grand adviser is the silver dragonborn Perak

  Over the millennia, disasters have destroyed large sections of the city. When this happens, it’s
  often easier to build on top of the rubble than to clear it, in the process burying ruined homes,
  streets, and entire neighborhoods. But these ancient ruins survive beneath the streets of
  Calimport, and sometimes construction uncovers pockets of Calimport’s long-forgotten past.
  Citizens with nowhere else to live take refuge in this undercity, which is called the Muzad.

<p data-content-chunk-id="15568acf-eef3-4666-85db-f4501d9a95b9">
  Cults, organized criminals, the Zhentarim, and assassins make extensive use of the Muzad, and the
  word “muzad” has become synonymous with any underground or illicit activity. The residents of this
  unofficial ward are careful not to draw the attention of surface dwellers or the ire of the city
  guard; criminals who threaten to draw too much attention are dealt with swiftly by their peers and
  rivals.

<p data-content-chunk-id="67a94d19-c147-4ecf-aa84-e6aaef3968fe">
  The Muzad hosts the Shadow Bazaar, a roving underground market operated by the Night Wisp gnome

  Life among the Genies
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f20cc454-c4aa-405c-9126-686238a89161">
  The influence of genies is ever-present in Calimshan outside of the major cities. Adventurers
  eager to acquire genies’ magic, however, will need to seek out those rare genies with the power to
  grant wishes. To find such genies, characters must travel to genie palaces in the desert, in the
  mountains, deep under the sea, or floating above Calimshan’s eastern forests. Before granting any
  wishes or other magic, however, these genies will send adventurers on missions to gather
  intelligence on rivals, punish or scheme against enemies, and enforce the genie’s commands.

  Djinn make excellent patrons for a party of adventurers. Chaotic and whimsical, some djinn enjoy

  The courts of other genies are more perilous. Adventurers might successfully negotiate with a
  marid through flattery and good storytelling skills, but dao are pitiless in their pursuit of
  wealth, and the tyrannical efreet are even worse. Instead of serving such genies, adventurers
  might enter cities ruled by dao and efreet on raids or spying expeditions.

  Early adventures among the genies pit the characters against Elementals and Humanoids who serve
  the genies. The first camp includes [monsters]Aarakocra Aeromancer;Aarakocra
  Aeromancers[/monsters], [monsters]Gargoyle;Gargoyles[/monsters], mephits, [monsters]Merfolk

  All Roads Lead to Calimport
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="76bcd955-8272-48a4-ae2c-1eaaf819c768">
  Adventures in Calimport place the characters in the greatest city of Faerûn. The characters might
  be locals who were born in Calimport and grew up in its markets. Other characters might be
  strangers, hailing from elsewhere in Calimshan or from far-off lands like the Sword Coast or
  Dalelands.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5adabab-6f9b-4aea-88d3-8bf2af17c298">
  Urban adventures differ from traditional dungeons in important ways. See “<a
    href="/sources/dnd/fraif/baldurs-gate#UrbanAdventure"
    data-content-chunk-id="c29b26ed-348b-4fbf-8ebd-3da202928ca9"
    >Urban Adventures</a
  >” in chapter 6 of this book for general advice. Furthermore, Calimport differs from other cities
  in the way magic is ever present. Illustrate this by allowing
  [monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters] met in the city to cast a cantrip or two, especially
  cantrips that have little use in combat, such as [spells]Elementalism[/spells],
  [spells]Mending[/spells], or [spells]Spare the Dying[/spells].
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be22f8dd-acec-480a-9a04-f12a08194809">
  Another way to emphasize the magical nature of Calimport is by including plenty of consumable
  magic items such as potions and [magicitems]Spell Scroll;Spell Scrolls[/magicitems] in adventure
  rewards. This allows characters to constantly discover new magic, but that magic is quickly used
  up or bartered away to obtain key items or secure allies.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0d5e109-4ec0-4f0c-982a-42e3bd7aaa2d">
  Wealth flows freely in Calimport. Characters can readily buy magic items and spellcasting
  services, and the sultana is so rich that you can embellish your Calimport adventure with any
  fantastical element and simply say, “The sultana pays for it.” This includes lavishing fantastic
  rewards on your characters. But fortune is fickle, and characters shouldn’t get too attached to
  this surplus of money and magic.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f85aff4-7e1a-47b1-bf00-fd83b7eaabdc">
  Explain the ephemeral nature of wealth and magic in Calimport to your players so they know what to
  expect and don’t get frustrated. Reassure them that while they might occasionally suffer
  cataclysmic bouts of bad luck, when their treasure is stolen overnight by thieves or wished away
  by a genie rival, the next windfall is never far around the corner, and by morning they might have
  a brand-new fortune.

      Calimshan is home to four genie factions that conspire against one another while also seeking
      to restore genies to prominence and overthrow Sultana Songal. Characters might ally themselves
      with one of these four factions, or they might serve Sultana Songal and work to keep the
      genies quarreling among each other. The sultana is safest when the genie factions are
      intriguing and conspiring against one another, too busy to focus their attention on her.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="23263395-4004-4523-b882-af159d133fb1">
      Each of the genie factions has one opposing faction they consider an enemy; the two other
      factions are rivals. (See “<a

        >Genie Factions</a
      >” earlier in this chapter.) Factions spy on other factions and work to overshadow or
      humiliate their rivals, and factions take any opportunity to harm or even destroy enemy
      factions. A faction might temporarily ally with a rival, but such an alliance is tenuous and
      ends when either faction sees a weakness or opening they might exploit.

  A Bastion in the Dallabad Oasis might look different than one in other parts of Faerûn. Bastion
  facilities in the oasis might be housed in pavilions and tents positioned around natural springs
  and lakes, shaded by date palms and connected by trails and paths. This doesn’t prevent the party

<p data-content-chunk-id="48cea3ce-3188-4ce6-9b6b-9aa7580c333e">
  The Bastion Events table in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> describes random events that
  affect a Bastion. You can tailor these events to Calimshan as follows.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e4d5d36-a51b-41b2-883d-86510306d856">
  <strong><em>Attack.</em></strong> Attacks on a Bastion in the Calim Desert likely come from
  [monsters]Bandit;Bandits[/monsters], [monsters]Gnoll Warrior;Gnoll Warriors[/monsters], or
  [monsters]Elemental Cultist;Elemental Cultists[/monsters] in service to an
  [monsters]Efreeti[/monsters]. Alternatively, the Bastion might have aroused the ire of a blue
  dragon.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ddc42c94-cded-492e-8034-4162ce13f145">
  <strong><em>Criminal Hireling.</em></strong> A criminal hiding in the desert might be wanted by
  dao, djinn, or marids. If their crimes were committed in Calimport, they might instead be a spy
  for one of the sultana’s many enemies.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2e87620-5941-4120-8287-43658c55c04d">
  <strong><em>Extraordinary Opportunity.</em></strong> The Bastion might open its gates for
  travelers, providing generous hospitality to all. Word spreads of the characters’ generosity, and
  caravans begin to regularly stop there to rest and socialize.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb83ffb2-c0da-4f0e-8bd8-e2760761bcd5">
  <strong><em>Friendly Visitors.</em></strong> Desert visitors come to the Bastion to avoid dealing
  with the cruel efreet of
  <a href="#GozvaKa" data-content-chunk-id="b2b2a4ed-1ca8-44f9-8a26-bbb18433f26f">Gozva Ka</a> or
  the bewildering streets of Calimport. They return to the desert when their task is done but might
  have interesting news or adventure hooks to share before they go.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd0f272d-a14d-4f73-9ebb-bdd5affb0934">
  <strong><em>Guest.</em></strong> Agents of the sultana and genie ambassadors make excellent
  guests.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af5354e4-7dc5-40ec-8cdc-56bd0e651922">
  <strong><em>Magical Discovery.</em></strong> Appropriate discoveries for Bastions in the desert
  include [magicitems]Potion of Animal Friendship;Potions of Animal Friendship[/magicitems],
  [magicitems]Potion of Fire Breath;Fire Breath[/magicitems], or [magicitems]Potion of
  Resistance;Resistance[/magicitems] and [magicitems]Spell Scroll;Spell Scrolls[/magicitems] of

  Use the Temple of a Thousand map earlier in this chapter for this adventure. Four wayward deities
  are causing the disturbance in the Forgotten Wing. Each deity was represented in the temple by a
  statue; the deities have manifested in these statues, which have transformed into monsters. Most
  can be talked down through social interaction or tests of skill. The deities are as follows:
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e126819-d056-4d6c-9f0e-7880a4ad0d50">
  <strong>Motanwe.</strong> Motanwe is a hunting god once revered by an extinct tribe of steppe
  nomads. He manifests as a Large stone statue of a horned humanoid (use the [monsters]Helmed
  Horror[/monsters] stat block). He is Indifferent to the party but is angrily grieving his
  long-dead people. He admires warriors and those with hunting skill.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffa1ea8c-6a04-417e-9031-5c81595527ce">
  <strong>Nimbus.</strong> Nimbus is a god of the sun who resents being overshadowed by, or even
  considered an aspect of, Lathander. Nimbus manifests as a flying orb of light three feet in
  diameter (Celestial, Chaotic Good [monsters]Empyrean Iota (Celestial);Empyrean Iota[/monsters]).
  Nimbus responds to hopeful, optimistic people and being shown it can still be relevant or useful.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="24e5de28-b4fb-4af1-98f1-5d4290a92a58">
  <strong>Korus.</strong> Korus is a deity of music who manifests as a Celestial
  <strong>[monsters]Performer Maestro[/monsters].</strong> Korus’s music is stately and formal, out
  of current fashion. Korus loudly insists artistic skill is the only true measure of a person’s
  value but really just wants to inspire people again.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63c5ed78-82b9-4f2f-85a8-b8b514ca68df">
  <strong>Sholoban.</strong> Sholoban is a deity of knowledge, riddles, and magic. She manifests as
  a <strong>[monsters]Couatl[/monsters].</strong> Sholoban knows deities fade in time and is
  resigned to her fate, but she wants to make sure mortal society has learned something from her
  time as a god. She engages in riddle contests and tests of ancient lore with knowledgeable
  characters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae626145-5d00-4b8f-8d9d-91dc1583016b">
  <strong>The Hukh.</strong> The Hukh is a mysterious, hungry deity propitiated only by blood and
  sacrifice. It manifests as a <strong>[monsters]Shadow Demon[/monsters].</strong> The Hukh lurks in
  the shadows and avoids the party, fighting if a character approaches. Other deities fear the Hukh
  and won’t help the characters defeat it, but they’re relieved if the characters destroy it.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b5a3051-da73-45e9-bd6b-9520977f52ae">
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> If three of the five deities are propitiated or destroyed,
  the surviving deities return to their enshrined locations in the Forgotten Wing and vanish,
  leaving only inanimate statues. The high priest thanks the characters with a [magicitems]Decanter
  of Endless Water[/magicitems] and 100 GP each.

  [monsters]Dao[/monsters], [monsters]Djinni;Djinn[/monsters], [monsters]Efreeti;Efreet[/monsters],
  and [monsters]Marid;Marids[/monsters]. Use the Palace Primordial map earlier in this chapter. Each
  day of the festival, the four genie ambassadors host magnificent feasts in their respective

  fantastic entertainments and sumptuous dishes.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d49d42a-0104-46e8-9112-6943a7ceb214">
  Each day, the characters can decide whether they linger at a feast, mingle with attendees, watch
  the various entertainments, or engage in some other activity. Each character has the opportunity
  to earn renown with one of the four genie factions by making a positive impression on one of the
  four ambassadors—a potential Renown Score increase of 1 per character per day. None of the genie
  ambassadors can cast the [spells]Wish[/spells] spell. The genies are as follows:
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9808ccb3-7107-4967-8965-b58a8b547c2e">
  <strong>Adviser Elçin.</strong> Elçin is a Djinni who is intelligent and aloof. She is Indifferent

  <strong>General Nirmalya.</strong> Nirmalya is an Efreeti and Indifferent to the characters. She
  enjoys revelry and demonstrating her magical powers. She is quick with compliments but equally
  quick to anger.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85d97dc6-b1d7-42c1-8efb-77adb557bcb0">
  <strong>Sovereign Firtina.</strong> Firtina is a Marid with many titles, but his favorite is
  Sovereign of the Seventh Wave. He is proud, whimsical, and Hostile to the characters. Firtina is

  character has the highest Renown Score with any of the genie factions. The ambassador from that
  faction becomes [rules]Friendly[/rules] to the party and confides to them that the meteor is
  actually the <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em>. The ambassador can’t allow any of their rivals to get
  the Artifact, so they give the party a [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of

  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Once the party recovers the <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em>,
  they’ll have to decide what to do with it. If they reveal all that’s occurred to Sultana Songal,
  she rewards each of them with 10,000 GP in coins and gems, then asks for the Artifact. She intends
  to hide it somewhere safe. Alternatively, the characters might decide to keep the Artifact for
  themselves. Regardless, the genies of Calimshan won’t stop trying to acquire it!
