  Araneas are reclusive shape-shifters. An aranea’s natural form resembles a bulky, humpbacked
  spider with two short arms beneath its head. An aranea can shape-shift into a humanoid form or
  into a multiarmed humanoid-spider hybrid. Araneas live in insular communities, such as the Spider
  Swamp in Calimshan, where they create beautiful objects that express their artistry and which are
  sometimes traded to other communities. Most araneas prefer to avoid combat, befuddling their foes
  long enough to skitter to safety.

<p><em>Ferocious, Shape-Changing Predator</em></p>
<p class="treasure-habitat">
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Coastal, Forest, Hills; <strong>Treasure:</strong> None
</p>
<p>
  Malar, god of the bestial hunt, sometimes manifests a spark of primal predation in physical form:
  the beast of Malar. The beast of Malar can take three types of forms—a land form, a sea form, and
  a sky form—to pursue prey across land, seas, and skies. In each form, its short fur is glossy
  black with red fur around its jaws and claws as though stained by the blood it has spilled.
</p>
<p>
  The beast of Malar has a muscular and unnatural appearance no matter its form; whether it
  resembles a bat, wolverine, or shark, there’s no mistaking the beast of Malar for a mundane
  animal. The beast shifts easily between its forms to pursue its prey, using whichever shape suits
  it best to catch and kill its quarry.
</p>
<p>
  Normally only one beast of Malar exists at a time. However, Malar might create multiple beasts to
  pursue legendary prey or simply display his extraordinary ferocity.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="BihaBabir">Biha Babir</h2>
<p><em>Scheming Marid Ruler</em></p>
<p>
  The calculating Biha Babir rules the pelagic city of Maran Saya in Calimshan. Though her physical
  form is as fluid as the ocean itself, she typically presents as a marid crowned in coral, with her
  lower half lengthening into a sinewy, eel-like tail.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="BihaBabirHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Before becoming ruler of Maran Saya, Biha Babir worked as a spy. She has traveled across
  Calimshan, infiltrating rival genie courts and eliminating remnants of the Twisted Rune. Some
  accounts even tell of her fighting alongside Sultana Songal during the Night of Fleeing Shadows.
</p>
<p>
  Biha Babir took up leadership of Maran Saya after the previous ruler, her father, retired. People
</p>
<p>
  know her as a shrewd ruler, preferring battles of wit over clashes of swords. Of the genie leaders
  in Calimshan, Biha Babir maintains the strongest spy network, and she is rumored to have
  informants in every major city of the region.
</p>
<p>
  For years, Biha Babir has searched tirelessly for the [magicitems]Calimemnon Crystal[/magicitems]
  (<a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/magic-items#CalimemnonCrystal">see chapter 8</a>), the legendary
  prison of the powerful genies Calim and Memnon. She believes obtaining that crystal would allow
  her to wipe Calimshan off the map and seize control of whatever genie empire rises from the
  wreckage.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="BihaBabirPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Biha Babir’s demeanor is like the ocean: seemingly placid on the surface, but dangerous and fierce
  deep below. Her amiable attitude hides a cunning mind. Biha Babir is politically savvy and prefers
  to outsmart her opponents rather than battle them, though she doesn’t shy from combat if
  necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Biha Babir covets opulence, but she also values information and learning just as much as material
  wealth. Offering valuable information is a surefire way to gain an audience with the her, but
  those caught lying to her are severely punished.

  <p>Using Biha Babir</p>
  <p>
    As the leader of Maran Saya, Biha Babir is a well-known public figure. The characters might
    encounter her in an official capacity where she is stern but pleasant, particularly around
    others she wants to impress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Biha Babir’s more significant campaign role, however, is as a spymaster. Her agents scheme to
    bring Maran Saya more influence and Biha Babir more personal power. Biha Babir can be pulling
    the strings behind efforts to free the genies Calim and Memnon from the Calimemnon Crystal or to
    otherwise sweep modern Calimshan away and install genie rulers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The characters might meet Biha Babir more than once without even realizing it, as she takes on
    different forms to suit her whims. The characters might meet Biha Babir in her marid form in the
    courts of Maran Saya and again in the guise of a well-intentioned courtier.

</p>
<p>
  The adventurers Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul seized divinity but were slain for their hubris. All three
  have been reborn and are now known as the Dead Three. Each of the Dead Three has inspired wicked
  cults that follow their paths of tyranny, murder, and necromancy.
</p>
<p>
  More than any other gods, the Dead Three directly influence Faerûn—and particularly the city of
  Baldur’s Gate—in malign ways. Cultists who receive orders from their patron god directly are often
  the most ambitious and most dangerous.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="CultistofBane">Cultist of Bane</h3>
<p>
  Cultists of Bane sow strife, either by directly bullying others or by abusing existing power
  structures to create division and oppression. Although many cultists of Bane are tyrants capable
  of influencing large groups of lackeys, other cultists prefer to operate from the shadows. These
  cultists use their forceful personalities to counsel well-intentioned rulers, turning benign
  organizations into dictatorships and twisting leaders into tyrants. They tattoo Bane’s symbol on
  their hands as a sign of devotion.

  bloodshed and honor to their sinister god rather than for financial recompense. These cunning

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="DeadThreeScion">Dead Three Scion</h2>
<p><em>Inheritor of a Malevolent Deific Triumvirate</em></p>
<p class="treasure-habitat">
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Underdark, Urban; <strong>Treasure:</strong> Relics
</p>
<p>
  Some wicked mortals have bound their souls to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul and gained a portion of
  malevolent divine power from each. A scion of the Dead Three might have seized this power in a
  sinister ritual or had it thrust on them by an evil Artifact or a god’s malevolent will. In any
  case, they possess cruelty, bloodlust, and necromantic power in equal measure and serve the Dead
  Three with their soul.
</p>
<p>
  A Dead Three scion leads cults to Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul—and often to all three. Sometimes the
  scion commands a single cult with an uneasy mix of adherents of each god, but a scion might lead
  separate cults from the shadows, playing them against each other and coordinating their efforts to
  bring the greatest amount of misery to a region.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="DeepDragons">Deep Dragons</h2>
<p><em>Dragons of Caverns and Secrets</em></p>
<p class="treasure-habitat">
  <strong>Habitat:</strong> Underdark; <strong>Treasure:</strong> Arcana
</p>
<p>
  Deep dragons slither through the wet and lightless places of the Underdark. They are stealthy
  hunters with an affinity for lost lore and fungi that flourish in the depths. As deep dragons age,
  their smooth, serpentine bodies become riddled with fungal rot, particularly around their faces,
  to imbue their breath with terror-inducing spores.
</p>
<p>
  Deep dragons covet treasure and knowledge. Some deep dragons seek to gain knowledge via experience
  and travel, slithering through caverns and seas of the Underdark to map hidden passages for dozens
  of miles. Other deep dragons enjoy cultivating groves of molds and fungi, including colossal
  varieties sufficient to conceal the dragons’ sinuous forms. Many deep dragons collect forgotten
  tomes or works of art and bully, cajole, or steal collections from drow or duergar sages.
</p>
<p>
  Deep dragons are excellent swimmers. They often clash with aquatic Underdark societies, such as
  kuo-toa. Many deep dragons demand tribute from these groups in the form of food or treasure.
</p>
<p>
  Underdark explorers have many reasons to brave deep dragon lairs beyond treasure hunting; they
  might contain the only surviving copies of forgotten lore, fungal ingredients for cures or
  plagues, or maps to lost Underdark locales.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="DeepDragonLairs">Deep Dragon Lairs</h3>
<p>
  Deep dragons lair in fungus-encrusted caverns of the Underdark or old, forgotten ruins, preferring
  locations near subterranean bodies of water.
</p>
<p>
  The region containing an adult or ancient deep dragon’s lair is changed by its presence, creating
  the following effects:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Preservation of Knowledge.</strong> Books and other written forms of communication with 1
  mile of the lair become magically protected and can’t be damaged by nonmagical means.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Restless Sleep.</strong> When a creature finishes a Long Rest within 1 mile of the lair,
  the creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t
  reduce its [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level as a result of finishing that Long Rest.
  Creatures with Immunity to the [condition]Poisoned[/condition] condition are immune to this
  effect.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Verdant Growth.</strong> Vegetation and fungi within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair grow
  faster and cover a greater area than normal. Foraging in this area yields twice the usual amount
  of food. The dragon is immediately aware of the presence of any creature that eats this enhanced
  vegetation.
</p>
<p>If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="DeepDragonWyrmling">Deep Dragon Wyrmling</h3>
<p>
  Deep dragon wyrmlings are lithe with a narrow frame and flexible wings. They slip through
  crevasses in the Underdark, from which they hunt to satisfy their voracious appetites.

  The strange magic pervading the Underdark twists deep dragons as they grow, so few adult deep
  dragons look alike. Their skin is usually pitted by fungal growths that spread across the body.
  Although lacking the versatile shape-shifting of metallic dragons, deep dragons can assume the
  form of animals or humanoids and often masquerade as snakes or dragonborn.
</p>
<p>
  Adult deep dragons eliminate challengers with ferocious might, cunning ambushes, or fungal
  poisons. Some adult deep dragons plunder the surface for treasures and lore.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="KarasChembryl">Karas Chembryl</h2>
<p><em>Assassin Heir to a Sinister Legacy</em></p>
<p>
  After the death of patriarch Fzoul Chembryl, House Chembryl and its descendants were scattered
  across Faerûn. Some members have dutifully continued the family’s dedication to Bane, while others
  have sought to free themselves from that god’s malignant shadow. However, none have embraced the
  Chembryls’ tyrannical legacy more than Karas Chembryl, a ruthless assassin whose devotion to the
  gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul has earned her the title Auspice of the Dead Three.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="KarasHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Karas was born to a distant branch of the Chembryl family living in Waterdeep. Though that side of
  the family had long since abandoned service of Bane, Karas began to exhibit signs of that god’s
  blessing: a callous silver-tongue, an unnaturally intimidating presence, and an affinity for
  occult magic. Out of fear, Karas’s parents discouraged her from using her gifts, hiding their
  family’s history and pressuring the girl toward a pretense of normalcy.
</p>
<p>
  Restless and dissatisfied with her life, Karas fell in league with the Zhentarim. When her surname
  sparked recognition among the elder Zhents, she began researching her lineage, eventually
  uncovering the stories of Fzoul Chembryl. Karas grew furious at her family for hiding the truth
  and embraced her gifts as a scion of Bane.
</p>
<p>
  Within a few years, Karas became a fearsome assassin and high-ranking member of the Zhentarim. Her
  travels across Faerûn led her to uncover Bane’s relationship with Bhaal and Myrkul. Feeling
  kinship with the oft-maligned gods, Karas pledged herself to the Dead Three. She now operates
  primarily out of Baldur’s Gate, where she strives to uncover remnants of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul’s
  might hidden in and around the bustling city.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="UsingKarasChembryl">
  <p>Using Karas Chembryl</p>
  <p>
    Karas Chembryl is a solid choice for a final villain in a low-level Baldur’s Gate campaign or in
    any campaign centered around the Dead Three or the Zhentarim. Characters might hear about her
    atrocities, seek out information about her unsavory connections, and then battle through
    cultists and Zhentarim defenders to confront her.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a longer campaign, Karas might be a mid-campaign threat who maintains a delicate relationship
    with other fervent followers of the Dead Three, such as the powerful cultists presented in this
    chapter. A [monsters]Dead Three Scion[/monsters], also presented in this chapter, might be the
    mastermind in such a campaign, manipulating Karas and others to topple civilization into
    wickedness.
  </p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="KarasPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Ruthless and fiercely independent, Karas craves power in all its forms. She wields her words with
  the same cunning as she does her blades, frequently luring opponents into underestimating her
  before striking unseen.
</p>
<p>
  Though she is a member of the Zhentarim, Karas cares little for the organization’s hierarchy and
  family dynamics. Karas views leadership of the Zhentarim as her birthright and hopes that, by
  amassing power from the Dead Three, she can one day overthrow the Pereghost, the leader of the
  Zhentarim, and claim what is rightfully hers.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="KarasChembrylsLair">Karas Chembryl’s Lair</h3>
<p>
  Karas operates from a hideout deep beneath the city of Baldur’s Gate. The hideout contains shrines
  to the Dead Three and her research about lore or
</p>
<p>
  Artifacts related to those gods. Only Karas’s most trusted confidantes know her hideout’s
  location.
</p>
<p>
  Karas extends her connection to the Dead Three into the region she inhabits, creating the
  following effects:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Creeping Dread.</strong> Terror runs rampant in Karas’s domain. Within 1 mile of the lair,
  creatures other than members of the Zhentarim and cultists of Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul have
  Disadvantage on saving throws to avoid or end the [condition]Frightened[/condition] condition.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Death’s Lore.</strong> When a Humanoid dies within 1 mile of the lair, Karas learns one
  secret that the Humanoid knew.
</p>
<p>If Karas dies or moves her lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Manshoon">Manshoon</h2>
<p><em>Evil Wizard of Duplicity and Duplication</em></p>
<p>
  Manshoon is an evil, arrogant wizard who was an instrumental founder of the Zhentarim centuries
  ago. That Manshoon is dead, and the current Manshoon is one of the original’s many clones. Being a
  magical copy rather than an original doesn’t make Manshoon any less of a threat, as he’s amassed
  magical skill and political influence he uses for his own gain. Manshoon considers the Zhentarim
  to be only one tool to amass personal power, and he casually sacrifices minions once they’ve
  outlived their usefulness. Manshoon doesn’t care who suffers so long he’s able to crush his many
  enemies and force his subjects into paranoid and eager obedience.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ManshoonHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  The original Manshoon was the undisputed lord of Zhentil Keep, where he honed the organization to
  suit his sinister will. He encouraged members to report on each other, punished discontent, and
  hoarded magical knowledge and personal secrets. The Zhentarim wouldn’t have become the
  organization it is today—one where treachery and subterfuge are the order of the day—without
  Manshoon’s formative influence.
</p>
<p>
  Manshoon made many enemies and sought to preserve his power by crafting several clones. A magical
  accident decades ago caused all his clones to activate at once and fight against one another in a
  devastating conflict called the Manshoon Wars. The original Manshoon and all but three of his
  clones were killed, and today only a single Manshoon is believed to be active in Faerûn. Manshoon
  subtly cultivates this belief to keep his true forces hidden.
</p>
<p>
  Manshoon seems to be a young man, but he is significantly older than he appears, and his mind
  harbors the skills and knowledge of an even older version of himself. One of Manshoon’s enemies,
  Halaster Blackcloak, removed Manshoon’s left arm at the elbow. Manshoon now uses a mechanical
  prosthetic arm.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="LearnMoreaboutManshoon">
  <p>Learn More about Manshoon</p>
  <p>
    Manshoon is one of the villains featured in the
    <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/wdh">Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</a> adventure.
  </p>
</aside>
<aside class="epigraph--with-author" id="ManshoonQuote">
  <p>
    You have drowned me, burned me, hacked off my limbs, poisoned me, petrified me, and turned me to
    ash. And yet, I live. Would it not be easier to yield to my inevitable triumph? Your death,
    unlike mine, shall be quick and merciful.
  </p>
  <p>—Manshoon</p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ManshoonPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  The Manshoon of today retains all his progenitor’s arrogance and duplicity. Manshoon keeps several
  other clones at hand to activate if necessary. He also employs the [spells]Simulacrum[/spells]
  spell to duplicate himself, his allies, and even his rivals. Manshoon knows that keeping people
  guessing about hidden identities makes them easier to manipulate.
</p>
<p>
  Manshoon usually wears a mask and concealing robes when meeting with others, even with loyal
  lieutenants and the Zhentarim’s inner circle. Even his allies aren’t sure when they’re meeting
  with the actual Manshoon, a clone, or someone else in disguise, which is just as Manshoon prefers.
</p>
<p>
  Manshoon seeks power and is checked only by the many enemies who want to see him dead. He recently
  failed to seize control of Waterdeep in a clandestine coup. It’s widely believed he’s turned his
  attentions elsewhere, but another Manshoon clone lurks in that city, manipulating the Zhentarim
  behind the scenes to amass sufficient power to assault Undermountain and face his old enemy,
  Halaster.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="UsingManshoon">
  <p>Using Manshoon</p>
  <p>
    Manshoon makes an excellent megalomaniacal supervillain. He has a distinctive outfit and mask,
    significant magical power, and the ego to confront fools who dare to stand against him. He feels
    no compunction about expending minions by the dozens to complete his goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Manshoon recently suffered a setback in Waterdeep, but his schemes can take him anywhere in the
    Forgotten Realms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like any effective supervillain, Manshoon is never truly defeated if you don’t need him to be.
    He maintains clones, spells that enable his escape, dupes who dress in his outfit, and other
    tricks to keep coming back against the characters again and again.

<p>
  Nimblewrights are fabricated from durable wood and animated by magic and clockwork gears. Some
  nimblewrights bear metal plates to protect their cogs and springs, while others have their
  workings exposed. No mere automatons, nimblewrights can form rudimentary plans and adapt their
  routines to account for dangers.
</p>
<p>
  Nimblewrights are surprisingly dexterous for creations made of animated wood and metal. A
  nimblewright walks with a flowing grace and fights with whirling pirouettes.
</p>
<p>
  Nimblewrights can serve as interesting background flavor in Calimshan or other areas where they
  are common. Roll or choose a result from the Nimblewright Tasks table as inspiration for what a
  nimblewright guard or nimblewright hulk might be doing in a busy public place.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="QueenForfallen">Queen Forfallen</h2>
<p><em>Rust-Riddled Pirate Queen</em></p>
<p>
  One of the most influential victims of the supernatural rusting curse throughout the Moonshae
  Isles is the pirate queen known as Queen Forfallen. She plies the seas in the largest and
  best-defended ship in the Moonshaes, the prize of her armada, which she’s strengthened with rusty
  metal plates and filled with a crew of bloodthirsty Rusted berserkers (see this chapter).
</p>
<p>
  Queen Forfallen is a strong human woman with long, red hair. Although the rusting curse has
  transformed most of her extremities into metal, she’s thus far resisted the weakening corrosion
  that the curse typically imparts to its victims. Her crew insists that her unquenchable thirst for
  plunder keep her hale.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ForfallenHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Few know Queen Forfallen’s background. She prefers to keep her focus on daring deeds as the most
  renowned pirate queen in the Moonshae Isles. But “Queen Forfallen” is the moniker adopted by
  Renauta, daughter of Olfgaut, and sister to Norland’s jarl, Olfsvenn. Renauta learned of the
  Rusting and embraced the curse as a path to strength and prowess.
</p>
<p>
  Queen Forfallen maintains clandestine communications with her brother, and they occasionally feed
  one another helpful information. Olfsvenn hopes he can steer Forfallen back to her name and role
  as Renauta, but Forfallen prefers her new identity.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="UsingQueenForfallen">
  <p>Using Queen Forfallen</p>
  <p>
    Queen Forfallen is a powerful warrior and leader. Her crews of Rusted creatures and pirates are
    well known in the Moonshae Isles, so the characters should hear about Queen Forfallen early in
    any campaign that features her. They might even see her in the distance at the prow of a ship of
    bloodthirsty raiders, having just left devastation in her wake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Queen Forfallen’s secret relation to Olfsvenn, Norland’s jarl, might compel the jarl to take
    actions that seem to be protecting or sheltering the vicious pirate queen. Uncovering Queen
    Forfallen’s lineage can provide unexpected opportunities for investigation, politics, and family
    drama in an otherwise straightforward pirate-hunting campaign.
  </p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ForfallenPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Queen Forfallen has a personality as powerful as her metal-clad muscles. She has a commanding
  voice well suited to carrying across a ship-to-ship battle and a firm, blunt demeanor that
  potential allies find hard to resist. Her growing network of supporters attests to her diplomatic
  skills and the shrewd mind behind her bold demeanor.
</p>
<p>
  She speaks to the scoundrels, bandits, smugglers, and others who live outside of Norlander
  society, promising coin and glory. More insidiously, she encourages the Rusting as a path to
  power, not debilitation, and those who crave her strength seek out infection. Forfallen has done
  more to spread the curse than anyone else in the Moonshae Isles.
</p>
<p>
  As with all victims of the Rusting, Forfallen feels a strong desire to despoil natural places.
  She’s been able to keep this desire in check, instead turning her energies to building alliances
  with other pirates and people afflicted by the Rusting, but she feels no remorse about deforesting
  old growth for ship’s wood or using ore wrenched from idyllic hills.
</p>
<aside class="epigraph--with-author" id="QueenForfallenLore">
  <p>
    The Rusting makes me strong, grants me long life, and protects me from my enemies. And you call
    it a curse! A curse on my foes, perhaps. But for me, a blessing!

<p>
  The supernatural Rusting curse that pervades the Moonshae Isles manifests as a thin scrim of iron
  over a living creature’s skin. This coarse iron rusts easily, turning the creature a sickly orange
  gray. Unchecked, this curse transforms the victim into a Rusted, an animated iron caricature of
  itself that sheds flakes of toxic rust.
</p>
<p>
  As the Rusting curse hardens the skin, it also hollows out the mind. Rusted creatures despise
  unspoiled nature and are compelled to destroy it when they can.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Sammaster">Sammaster</h2>
<p><em>Lich Founder of a Dracolich Cult</em></p>
<p>
  Sammaster founded and led the Cult of the Dragon, a secret, evil organization dedicated to
  transforming living dragons into undead inheritors of a world blasted of life. Sammaster was slain
  centuries ago but now exists as a lich with his essence tied to a powerful dracolich form.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="SammasterHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Sammaster was a keenly intelligent wizard born centuries ago. A quick study throughout his
  itinerant apprenticeship, Sammaster primarily studied magic relating to dragons. After learning
  all he could from other archmages, including Elminster and Alustriel Silverhand, Sammaster delved
  into new frontiers of necromancy and enchantment. He created the process to transform dragons into
  dracoliches, magically bound dragons to his service, and learned how to drive dragons across
  Faerûn into a berserk rage. He considered his intellect beyond morality and became paranoid,
  resentful, and megalomaniacal.
</p>
<p>
  Sammaster’s travels brought him into contact with people who revered dragons as icons of primeval
  might. Masquerading his desire to dominate dragonkind as devotion, Sammaster established himself
</p>
<p>
  as leader of these disparate zealots, whom he named the Cult of the Dragon. He perverted their
  fascination with his necromantic lore, revealing that dracoliches were destined to rule Faerûn.
  His Cult of the Dragon devotes itself to helping evil dragons become dracoliches to bring this
  evil new age to fruition.
</p>
<p>
  Sammaster was killed in battle, but had prepared contingencies for his demise. He drew on the
  warped resurrection of dracoliches to become a lich himself. He continues to lead the Cult of the
  Dragon from the shadows, developing new ways to control and corrupt dragonkind.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="UsingSammaster">
  <p>Using Sammaster</p>
  <p>
    Sammaster makes for a fearsome adversary in a campaign featuring the Cult of the Dragon. He
    frequently travels the Realms to check in on cult cells, which presents opportunities for the
    characters to interact with the lich, even in lower-level adventures. Sammaster’s looming
    presence throughout a campaign foreshadows greater machinations behind smaller-scale cult
    activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    A direct confrontation with Sammaster makes for an epic climax to a campaign. However, Sammaster
    is notoriously difficult to defeat even once, and thanks to his soul gem, he can keep coming
    back to plague Faerûn unless the characters can find a way to destroy the gem.
  </p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="SammasterPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Sammaster presents a charming and handsome facade, but he can’t conceal his morbid fascination
  with undead dragonkind for long. His only true allies are the inner circle of the Cult of the
  Dragon, from whom he commands obedience.
</p>
<p>
  Sammaster rarely remains in one place for long, as he thinks no one can oversee the Cult of the
  Dragon activities across the Realms as efficiently as he can. Sammaster personally checks in on
  the cult’s most important plots, often surprising his minions with his presence.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than keep a soul jar as liches do, Sammaster keeps a magical soul gem in the same fashion
  as dracoliches. When destroyed in his lich form, Sammaster revives in the form of a dracolich with
  his soul gem as its heart. He can be permanently destroyed only by vanquishing this dracolich form
  and then destroying the soul gem before it reconstitutes him as a lich once again.
</p>
<p>
  Would-be heroes have believed themselves victorious against Sammaster in the past, but the clever
  wizard returns each time to steer the Cult of the Dragon into more desperate and sinister plots.

<p class="treasure-habitat"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Any; <strong>Treasure:</strong> Any</p>
<p>
  Spirit dragons, sometimes called song dragons, are powerful dragons whose powers stem from the
  magic and history of fallen realms. They embody the spirit of a bygone age, and so as they grow
  and mature, they develop an erratic control over time.
</p>
<p>
  A spirit dragon’s primary motivation is to unearth and study the ruins of the ancient realm from
  which it arose. Spirit dragons share an innate intellectual curiosity, and many have a deep
  appreciation for the culture and art of humanoid societies.
</p>
<p>
  Spirit dragons find even the most commonplace melodies moving. A song written in the time and
  region from which a spirit dragon hails can potentially overwhelm the dragon, driving it to either
  morose despondence or passionate rage.
</p>
<p>
  No two spirit dragons are exactly alike; each individual bears features distinct to the empire
  from which it hails. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Dragon Origins table to determine
  which lost realm a spirit dragon is from.

<p>Spirit dragons haunt the ruined cities and buried monuments of ancient empires.</p>
<p>
  The region containing an adult or ancient spirit dragon’s lair is changed by its presence,
  creating the following effects:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Enchanted Acoustics.</strong> Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have Advantage on
  Charisma ([skill]Performance[/skill]) checks that involve singing or playing music. Creatures
  other than the dragon and its allies in that area have Disadvantage on saving throws to avoid or
  end the [condition]Charmed[/condition] condition.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Time Distortion.</strong> While within 1 mile of the lair, creatures age at one-tenth the
  usual rate.
</p>
<p>If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="SpiritDragonWyrmling">Spirit Dragon Wyrmling</h3>
<p>
  When a dragon egg is found buried among ancient rubble and given the right conditions, a spirit
  dragon wyrmling might hatch from the egg. Left to its own devices, a wyrmling wanders the ruins
  that the dragon originated from.

  Ancient spirit dragons have outgrown the petty concerns of the current age. After centuries of
  studying the culture and beliefs of an ancient empire, a spirit dragon’s personality and outlook
  are often indistinguishable from that fallen realm’s.

  A spore of Moander is a rotting mass of vegetation infused with the divine power of Moander, dead
  god of corruption and decay. Spores arise on the Material Plane where Moander’s influence can
  still be felt: primordial swamps, ancient forests, and miasmic lagoons touched by Abyssal evil.
</p>

  A spore of Moander has no grand agenda beyond spreading death and sorrow. Still, cultists of
  Moander look on these terrible creatures with reverence, believing that each spore is a window

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="ValindraShadowmantle">Valindra Shadowmantle</h2>
<p><em>Cold and Calculating Lich Wizard</em></p>
<p>
  Valindra Shadowmantle was a selfish and ambitious high elf wizard who eschewed her community in
  search of arcane power in the wider world. Valindra has no compunctions about forming allies of
  convenience, and she’s worked with Szass Tam and his Red Wizards of Thay, the Arcane Brotherhood
  of Luskan, devil cultists, and more.
</p>
<p>
  Although Valindra has the sunken pallor common to liches, she prefers to maintain a magical
  disguise that allows her to appear as the high elf she was in life. Ever the schemer, Valindra
  doesn’t use this disguise out of nostalgia or regret, but to hide the powers she has since gained
  as an Undead creature.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ValindraHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Whether Valindra chose to leave the high elf community in which she was raised or whether she was
  cast out for cruelty is unclear. In either case, Valindra traveled the Sword Coast and the North,
  apprenticing herself to whichever wizards might impart knowledge to an eager and flattering pupil.
</p>
<p>
  Valindra took her skills to the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan, where she earned the special
  attention of its head, Arklem Greeth. Arklem and Valindra were close; when they were slain, they
  arose as liches together with gems to house their souls.
</p>
<p>
  Valindra has since left Arklem and the Arcane Brotherhood to serve as a knowledgeable operative
  for cults, secret societies, and criminal enterprises. Valindra provides her services only for a
  carefully considered price, whether arcane secrets, powerful magic items, or favors.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ValindraPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Valindra likes to present as a pleasant, overcurious scholar. She prefers to leverage her
  intellect over raw might and enjoys victories earned through outmaneuvering her foes rather than
  brute arcane might. If she can twist her enemies into fighting each other or stumbling into
  unwinnable ambushes, she never has to reveal the true extent of her abilities. Valindra sometimes
  makes the calculated decision to face destruction rather than reveal the extent of her secrets,
  confident that her soul gem can revive her.
</p>
<p>
  Valindra maintains cordial relations with the many evil organizations she’s served to better
  leverage their aid in the future. She betrays an allied
</p>
<p>
  group only when she needs to eliminate witnesses who might paint her as untrustworthy. Many
  sinister groups overlook rumors of disloyalty for a chance to leverage her overwhelming arcane
  power.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ValindraShadowmantlesLair">
  Valindra Shadowmantle’s Lair
</h3>
<p>
  Valindra lairs within a sprawling, ruined library in the Shadowfell. After several disastrous
  confrontations with enemies of her temporary allies, she’s elected to keep her personal lair
  secret. Deep within her lair is a hidden reading room where she usually keeps her spirit gem.
</p>
<p>
  The region containing Valindra’s lair is warped by her presence, creating the following effects:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>All-Seeing.</strong> While in her lair, Valindra can cast [spells]Clairvoyance[/spells],
  requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as her Spellcasting action.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Apathy.</strong> Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that aren’t Undead have Disadvantage
  on Death Saving Throws and Initiative rolls.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Thirst for Knowledge.</strong> Within 1 mile of the lair, creatures have Advantage on
  Intelligence checks made when they take the Study action.

  <p>
    Valindra is featured in <em>The Fallbacks: Bound for Ruin</em> novel and the
    <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/toa">Tomb of Annihilation</a> adventure. You can learn
    more about her origins in <em>The Pirate King</em> (part of the Legend of Drizzt series).

  <p>Using Valindra Shadowmantle</p>
  <p>
    As a powerful lich who doesn’t maintain any particular loyalties for very long, Valindra can
    serve as a surprise lieutenant or mastermind behind any sinister organization in your campaign.
    She might be investigating a powerful Artifact or leading an important ritual. Valindra
    frequently leverages her many prior connections, so her presence might bring different evil
    groups together in an uneasy alliance.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might foreshadow Valindra’s presence by dropping hints that a martial organization like the
    Zhentarim has unexpected magical support, or having cultists refer to a capable elf “specialist”
    who is sharing her magical secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Valindra hides her true nature behind an illusion of her mortal form. You can therefore keep her
    lich powers a surprise, especially if you want to have her return after being defeated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Valindra’s lair can be the setting of her showdown against the characters, or it can be a hidden
    location the characters must quickly find to finish off Valindra for good.

<p>
  Among the rarest of were-creatures, werewyverns change from their humanoid forms into lean wyverns
  or into draconic-humanoid hybrids. Most werewyverns possess a draconic greed and ferocity and thus
  often find work as bandits, mercenaries, or assassins. They are opportunistic warriors and prefer
  ambushes when possible. Werewyverns like to keep their wyvern form a secret until they need an
  upper hand in a fight or an aerial escape.
</p>
<p>
  Werewyverns transmit lycanthropy through their potent venom. The curse’s transmission is
  unpredictable and often as much a surprise to the werewyvern as it is to the victim.

<p><em>Scheming Lich in a Monstrous, Frozen Form</em></p>
<p>
  Zlan is a horrid, icy amalgamation of the seven liches who created the Artifact
  <em>Crenshinibon</em>, better known as the <em>Crystal Shard.</em> Zlan Clervish was one of those
  seven liches, and that lich’s will predominates in the fused entity. All seven bodies are frozen
  together with ice and black crystal called chardalyn, fragments of the shattered
  <em>Crystal Shard.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Zlan has leveraged its connection with the shattered Artifact to psychically infest chardalyn,
  using the crystalline material to observe enemies and warp minds.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ZlanHistory">History</h3>
<p>
  Seven powerful liches from other worlds came together to create the
  <em>Crystal Shard</em> millennia ago. Although the liches were jealous and suspicious of each
  other, their combined power was sufficient to create the sentient Artifact. The
  <em>Crystal Shard</em> absorbed its creators’ minds, which resonated within the crystal of the
  <em>Crystal Shard</em> thereafter. When the <em>Crystal Shard</em> was destroyed, its fragments,
  called chardalyn, still echoed with its creators’ malevolent minds. Fragments of ice and chardalyn
  drew together around the remains of the seven liches, creating an amalgamated form.
</p>
<p>
  Zlan is the foremost mind among the liches and controls the body, The other liches rage and scheme
  about being subsidiary to someone they once considered both a rival and an equal. The Zlan Liches
  table gives a brief description of each component.

  <p>Using Zlan</p>
  <p>
    Zlan is an unsettling monstrosity of ice, black crystal, and alien dead. The characters should
    see Zlan long before they confront him, crawling across the icy wastes in pursuit of some
    mysterious goal. Tales of Zlan’s bizarre power and unsettling psychic influence should reach the
    characters, making Zlan seem like a terrible, eldritch entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Zlan’s eerie connection to chardalyn allows him to spread his mental influence to the
    characters’ friends and enemies alike, and perhaps even to the characters themselves. You can
    use chardalyn’s psychic resonance to give the characters brief, confusing glimpses of Zlan’s
    plans to propel the plot.
  </p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude" id="ZlanPersonality">Personality</h3>
<p>
  Zlan has an affinity for enchantment and corrupting minds. During the time he was working to
  create the <em>Crystal Shard</em>, Zlan was a devotee of a god of darkness, confusion, and pain.
  Zlan likes to subtly twist minds to confusion and paranoia and doesn’t take direct action when an
  oblique or hidden action will suffice. Its plans always contain fallbacks and contingencies. One
  of these contingencies—one the other liches who constitute its new form failed to foresee—was to
  assume control of the other liches if <em>Crystal Shard</em> was destroyed and created the
  multi-lich entity.
</p>
<p>
  Zlan schemes about how to restore and control <em>Crystal Shard</em>’s power through the
  accumulation of chardalyn from across Icewind Dale. Zlan’s affinity with chardalyn allows it to
  access information across the region and use chardalyn to corrupt those who could prove useful.
</p>
<p>
  Zlan’s current plan is to heat Icewind Dale from below, warming the Underdark to melt its ice and
  release aberrant terrors from frozen stasis. This melting also exposes ancient sites containing
  power Zlan needs to enforce its wicked will on the region.
