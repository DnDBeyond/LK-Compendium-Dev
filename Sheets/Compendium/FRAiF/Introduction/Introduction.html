  The world of Faerûn is a setting for every kind of fantasy adventure, from survival horror to high
  magic. But adventures in the Realms have one thing in common: their epic nature. Heroes
  adventuring in Faerûn seldom face mundane enemies with petty agendas. Instead, even the most
  ordinary antagonist is part of a grand plot—a larger-than-life adventure that pits the heroes
  against unforgettable foes.
