  From the simplest cantrip to the mightiest workings of high magic, from a humble [spells]Cure
  Wounds[/spells] spell to the raising of mighty heroes from the dead, magic permeates the Realms.
  And any understanding of magic in Faerûn begins with understanding the Weave.

  The Weave
</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e4cdf0f-89b2-4c71-a101-657bad033906">
  The Weave is the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven—an essential element of
  the universe that flows through all things. Some creatures, objects, and locations have especially
  deep connections to the Weave. Such creatures can perform extraordinary feats that come naturally
  to them (a beholder’s flight, a vampire’s charming gaze, a dragon’s breath weapon, and so forth),
  while individuals with the necessary talent and skill can cast spells by manipulating the Weave.
  The Weave isn’t normally visible or detectable, except through the use of spells.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9d4d992-6d80-492f-af13-6f9d5d79a2e5">
  The god Mystra is the Weave’s keeper and caretaker. All three times the god of magic died or was
  separated from her divinity (twice as Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic was
  twisted or failed entirely. With Mystra’s most recent death and the arrival of the Spellplague,
  the Weave was thought to be destroyed. But in the Second Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave
  returned, and spells and magic items became reliable once more.

  Magic Items
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7048aba9-8141-4b90-bb15-3284a5892ea9">
  While a spell is brought to life by manipulating threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic
  item ties those threads together. The Weave enables individuals to call forth the energy inside a
  magic item. When a creature attunes to a magic item, threads of the Weave from both wielder and
  magic item become entwined.

<p data-content-chunk-id="fe9b4e4c-c3f7-4190-ac1d-1b3ae9a3f9ab">
  Spellfire is the raw energy of the Weave. The ability to refine and control it is a gift bestowed
  on a handful of people every generation. Spellfire can manifest as a font of silver light or
  healing energy, it can absorb magic, or it can be a searing blue-white jet of all-consuming
  radiance.

    The rules for spells and spellcasting found in the
    <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a> are true in Faerûn, but
    some spells and magical effects might interact in unique ways with the Weave.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Detect Magic.</em></strong> The [spells]Detect Magic[/spells] spell reveals threads
    of the Weave woven together through spellcasting, and the way the threads are arranged reveals
    the school of magic. Similarly, active spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a
    silvery network of threads, which might twist and reknit themselves depending on the magic
    involved. A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Dispel Magic.</em></strong> The [spells]Dispel Magic[/spells] spell unravels woven
    threads of the Weave.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Antimagic.</em></strong> The [spells]Antimagic Field[/spells] spell unravels magic
    woven from the Weave. While an otherwise-permanent effect is within an area of antimagic, the
    knots of the Weave untie, but the threads retie themselves once the magic is outside the
    antimagic effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Dead Magic.</em></strong> In areas of dead magic, the Weave is absent. Not only do
    spells and magic items cease to function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures that
    are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of the Weave they carry with them
    unravels.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Wild Magic.</em></strong> In an area of wild magic, the Weave becomes tangled,
    spontaneously forming its own magic. It also twists the magical creations of the Weave, causing
    unexpected results.

  Wild Magic and Dead Magic
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="457c03b0-fbe7-4ce9-aa94-ba14535ab9e6">
  In some parts of Faerûn, the Weave is so warped or frayed that magic doesn’t function reliably,
  resulting in a wild magic zone. This damage might be due to magical disasters—such as those
  created during the Time of Troubles, the Spellplague, and the Second Sundering—or a powerful
  effect that distorts the Weave, such as a mythal (see below). Wild magic zones usually go
  unnoticed until they make some spell effect go awry. Some mages establish strongholds near wild
  magic zones. They chart the boundaries of the wild magic zone, lure enemies into it, and then take
  advantage of their foes’ confusion and weakness.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="48ea80ac-7204-4fa4-8ad9-185e505d6c0e">
  In other parts of Faerûn, however, the Weave has a tear or hole, resulting in a dead magic zone.
  Many were created where extreme concentrations of magical power were abruptly shattered or
  destroyed. The ruins of Myth Drannor, for example, boast large dead magic zones. Dead magic zones
  also might manifest at locations where Artifacts are destroyed or gods are slain, ripping a hole
  into the Weave.

  High Magic
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bdd7374a-c137-4fd9-b63b-5506d243f91c">
  In Faerûn’s early ages, the Weave hadn’t yet stabilized. Elf mages at that time developed a
  spellcasting system called high magic. This system required many—sometimes hundreds—of
  spellcasters working in concert, and a single magical effect could take days or weeks to complete.
  But high magic was capable of incredible feats beyond the reach of ordinary spellcasters today.
  Elf high mages could heal hundreds of people at once, simultaneously create multiple magic items,
  restore large portions of forest, or destroy an entire city. The most famous examples of high
  magic are the raising of the island of Evermeet from the sea and the creation of mythals.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d55ffb70-415b-49dd-b4f5-e56cc58811ec">
  For ages, high magic was thought lost, its techniques supplanted by traditional spellcasting as
  the Weave settled into its current form. But some secrets of high magic have been preserved,
  though few living spellcasters retain this knowledge.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b85772bc-b5cd-482b-aaae-e93b06aeca92">
  Examples of high magic can be found in

  Mythals
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e06c5f2-d7e3-46df-a8bb-98461d7bd9ef">
  Mythals are some of the most powerful magic in Faerûn. These creations are permanent fields of
  overlapping magical wards that bind and shape the Weave in a particular location. Mythals are
  sometimes so powerful that they bend or rewrite the rules of magic or even reality.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d02320b-6cee-4295-a4e4-1bc69d0232c2">
  In its original usage, the term “mythal” referred to works of high magic that protected ancient
  elven cities, such as Myth Drannor. Its meaning has since expanded to cover all manner of similar
  protections, such as the magic keeping the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril afloat, the
  wards of Silverymoon, and the smaller workings of magic that keep safe important locations like
  Candlekeep. Some even consider the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain beneath
  Waterdeep a mythal.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b37a2bce-cb52-4ab4-b1cb-7f94b5c3c1ef">
  Most mythals restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the area they govern; for
  example, a mythal might restrict teleportation magic or spells of the Conjuration school.
  Evereska’s mythal influences the area’s weather and wards its inhabitants against disease, while
  the mythal of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable and more comfortable for creatures
  not suited to underwater life.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8797ff80-a415-49eb-af24-fbd99371d969">
  In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic item than a living creation of magic,
  capable of growing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. Mythals can sometimes heal
  themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra’s
  most recent return.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b2a84f8a-a036-4f22-9ce4-f945441c168d">
  Each active mythal has one or more individuals especially attuned to it, and these individuals can
  ignore any restrictions on spellcasting, direct targetable effects of the mythal, and teach others
  of appropriate skill how to access its secrets.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ff3567e-5a04-43f2-ac18-5228c58a3ab7">
  Adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or failing mythals in ruined locations where
  magic once had great influence. Although an [spells]Identify[/spells] spell might reveal some of a
  mythal’s simplest effects, spellcasters can discover spellcasting restrictions only by trying (and
  failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a
  mythal without assistance, but such feats are rarely attempted by even the most renowned mages.
  Any elven city with “Myth” in its name (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has
  or had a mythal. The ruins of such places often exhibit unpredictable effects related to their
  damaged or destroyed mythals.

  Millennia ago, elf mages researching alternative magical traditions developed a technique by which
  many spellcasters working together could cast spells beyond the limit of any individual. This
  technique became known as circle magic, and although it was initially developed by elves,
  spellcasters in Thay and Rashemen reinvented the technique, and from there it quickly spread to
  other realms in Faerûn.

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="CircleMagicintheGame">
  <p>Circle Magic in the Game</p>
  <p>
    Circle magic provides unique and strategic ways of altering spellcasting. Here are some general
    guidelines for implementing circle magic in your game.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Character Level and Experience.</em></strong> Though characters of any level can use
    circle magic, characters with access to higher-level spells have more avenues to make the most
    of circle magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Know Your Spells.</em></strong> Casting a Circle spell benefits from a solid
    understanding of how regular spellcasting works. Be sure to study your prepared spells and
    Circle casting options before the game. Many Circle casting options provide the most benefits to
    spellcasting when used outside of combat!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Plan Ahead.</em></strong> Circle magic functions best when participants strategize
    ahead of time. To avoid bogging down combat, work together with fellow spellcasters to determine
    how and when to cast a Circle spell. Additionally, ensure all participants still have ample
    opportunity to cast spells and act independently beyond contributing to circle magic.

  You conjure a pillar of spellfire in a 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high [rules]Cylinder[/rules]
  centered on a point within range. The area of the Cylinder is [rules]Bright Light[/rules], and
  each creature in it when it appears makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Radiant damage
  on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when
  it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes
  this save only once per turn.

  In addition, whenever a creature in the Cylinder casts a spell, that creature makes a Constitution
  saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action,
  or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn’t
  expended.

  [rules]Concentration[/rules]. When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 3+
  spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.
