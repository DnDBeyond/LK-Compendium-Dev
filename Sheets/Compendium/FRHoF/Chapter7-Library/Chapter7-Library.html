<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="AdventureSummary">Adventure Summary</h2>
<p>
  The characters are contacted by Myrna Nor, a student of magic and wealthy heir. Myrna and her
  former colleague, Powell “the Owl” Niccam, have deduced the location of a hidden library built
  centuries ago by Lethchauntos, an infamous wizard.
</p>
<p>
  But Myrna and Powell have had a falling out. The library is believed to contain the
  <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a>, a legendary book detailing deadly poisons and powerful spells.
  Powell wants to recover the <em>Nathlum</em> and sell it to the Zhentarim for a fortune. Myrna
  wants to preserve the <em>Nathlum</em> and restore Lethchauntos’s unjustly tarnished legacy.
</p>
<p>
  Myrna hires the characters to find the <em>Nathlum</em> before Powell does. The party travels to
  the library to find Powell already there. They must overcome her guards and navigate the library’s
  dangers. Eventually the characters confront Powell to recover the <em>Nathlum.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The adventure takes two or three sessions. When the characters return to Myrna, hopefully with the
  <em>Nathlum</em>, they should be level 3.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="AdventureBackground">Adventure Background</h2>
<p>
  The story of this adventure involves an infamous wizard named Lethchauntos whose work and legacy
  have been long misunderstood. Recently two students of magic discovered the truth about him and
  located five hidden libraries he constructed.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="LethchauntossTragicLife">Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life</h3>
<p>
  Five centuries ago, an orc priest named Wund forged a kingdom under the Sword Mountains, choosing
  an orc warlord named Uruth as a figurehead ruler. Wund was devoted to an evil god of death and
  disease, and Uruth was a cruel warmonger. A young orc wizard named Nath fled the Sword Mountains
  with his wife Ona and their children to avoid the wars he knew Wund and Uruth would soon wage.
</p>
<p>
  Settling near the village of Phandalin south of Neverwinter, Nath traded with farming families and
  shared arcane knowledge with the crafters of nearby Wave Echo Cave. Nath hid his identity to
  protect himself and his family, and the folk of Phandalin knew him as Lethchauntos.
</p>
<p>
  Nath and his family had peace for a few years but, deeply troubled by Wund’s leadership,
  Lethchauntos decided to take action. With the skilled crafters of Wave Echo Cave, he forged the
  <em>Ettin Axe</em>, a sentient weapon with two distinct minds and personalities. Then, leaving his
  family, he returned to the Sword Mountains and sought out Uruth. Nath argued that Wund was selfish
  and manipulative, and Uruth had an obligation to be a wiser, better king. He gave Uruth the
  <em>Ettin Axe</em>, optimistically hoping that the axe’s two minds would balance out the bad
  advice Uruth was getting from Wend.
</p>
<p>
  For a brief time, Wund, Nath, Uruth, and the twin minds of the <em>Ettin Axe</em> were locked in a
  power struggle for Uruth’s realm. But communications from Nath’s family ceased and, fearing the
  worst, the wizard fled home to find his family dead from poisons only Wund knew how to brew.
  Wund’s spies had identified Nath’s family and murdered them.
</p>
<p>
  Nath was devastated. Donning black robes of mourning, he forsook his birth name. For the rest of
  his life, he wore only black and answered only to Lethchauntos. For twenty years, he researched
  Wund’s poisons in an attempt to find antidotes to the poisons that killed his family, collecting
  this knowledge in a book he dubbed the <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a>, and planned elaborate
  memorials for his loved ones.
</p>
<p>
  Uruth and Wund eventually perished in war, but one of Uruth’s successors discovered Lethchauntos’s
  location and led a raid against Phandalin, devastating the region.
</p>
<p>
  Lethchauntos survived, but he considered himself cursed for bringing death to his friends and
  family. He left Phandalin and put his final plans in motion, visiting the Dalelands, Icewind Dale,
  Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate, places his family had spoken of visiting. In
  each of these locations, he constructed a hidden library, burying one of his family in each
  location. When the last library was complete, Lethchauntos departed for the Outer Planes. His
  final fate is unknown.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ATaleofTwoApprentices">A Tale of Two Apprentices</h3>
<p>
  Today Lethchauntos is mostly forgotten, and those who do recall him believe he was an evil wizard
  due to his association with poison and slaughter. But two students of magic named Myrna Nor and
  Powell Niccam discovered the existence of the <em>Nathlum</em> from old records found in Phandalin
  and Wave Echo Cave. The two didn’t agree on what to do next, though. While Myrna wanted to recover
  the <em>Nathlum</em> for academic purposes, Powell saw an opportunity to get rich quick.

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Powell reached out to Zhentarim agents and told them about the <em>Nathlum</em>, which details
  many deadly poisons. She offered to share the knowledge with the Zhentarim in exchange for the
  agents’ help in recovering the <em>Nathlum.</em> With Zhentarim allies and goblin and hobgoblin
  mercenaries she hired along the way, Powell set out for the hidden library near Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p>
  Myrna wants to stop Powell, but she’s no adventurer. She uses her merchant contacts to locate the
  characters, and she hires them to stop Powell and recover the <em>Nathlum.</em>
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="StartingtheAdventure">Starting the Adventure</h2>
<p>When you’re ready to start the adventure, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="YoumeetattheOldSkullInn">
  <p>
    You meet at the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale. Your host is Myrna Nor, the heir to a wealthy
    Sembian trading house. When you arrive, she gestures toward chairs in a rustic sitting room.
    “Please, make yourselves comfortable. I’m so grateful to you all for meeting me here. I have a
    terrible problem, and I’m hoping you can solve it.
  </p>
  <p>
    “My colleague Powell Niccam and I learned of a hidden library built by a long-dead orc wizard
    named Lethchauntos. He wrote the <em>Nathlum</em>, a book of arcane lore that we believe is
    located in this hidden library. But Powell has offered to sell the tome’s secrets to the
    Zhentarim!
  </p>
  <p>
    “The <em>Nathlum</em> details how to create many rare poisons, as well as their cures. Who knows
    what the Zhentarim would do with such knowledge? No, the <em>Nathlum</em>—and the rest of the
    library—must be recovered for the good of Faerûn.”
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Myrna offers the characters 100 GP each to travel to the library and recover the
  <em>Nathlum.</em> She can answer questions about Lethchauntos, Powell, and the
  <em>Nathlum.</em> She can tell the characters the information in “<a
    href="#LethchauntossTragicLife"
    >Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life</a
  >” above, which she has pieced together though she’s eager to obtain more evidence. She insists
  Lethchauntos wasn’t an evil wizard but a tragic and well-meaning figure, if sometimes misguided.
</p>
<p>
  Myrna describes Powell as a cunning and brilliant student of magic. Powell is tall and thin, with
  a wide-eyed, blinking expression that earned her the nickname “the Owl.”
</p>
<p>
  As for the <em>Nathlum</em>, Myrna knows the tome contains poison recipes and powerful spells, but
  she doesn’t know the exact details.
</p>
<p>
  Myrna provides the location of the library’s entrance in Cormanthor, beneath a hill between the
  Standing Stone and Myth Drannor. She tells the characters Lethchauntos built five hidden
  libraries, reburying one of his family members at each, but she believes the <em>Nathlum</em> is
  at this one.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr h3-override" id="TravelingtotheLibrary">Traveling to the Library</h2>
<p>
  The journey to the library is about 100 miles, a journey of 4 days. You can roll random encounters
  on the Cormanthor Encounters table in chapter 2 or have the journey be uneventful. Along the way,
  the characters can get to know each other, sharing elements of their backstories as they travel.
</p>
<p>When the characters reach the library entrance, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thedoortothelostlibrary">
  <p>
    The door to the lost library of Lethchauntos stands before you, right where Myrna Nor said it
    would be. The door is built into a hillside, but you clearly aren’t the first ones to discover
    it. Brush has been cleared away from it, and footprints lead up to the closed door.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  As a [action]Search[/action] action, a character can inspect the prints and make a DC 10 Wisdom
  ([skill]Survival[/skill]) check, identifying them on a successful check as belonging to Medium and
  Small booted people, some of them goblinoids. The door opens to reveal a corridor leading north to
  area 1.
</p>
<p>
  A character who searches the nearby area finds a cave 150 feet from the library door. A character
  who takes the [action]Study[/action] action and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence
  ([skill]Nature[/skill]) check determines the cave leads to a bear’s den. This cave entrance leads
  to area 3.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr h3-override" id="LibraryFeaturesLostLibrary">Library Features</h2>
<p>The library has the following features.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override" id="Light">Light</h3>
<p>
  Powell and her followers placed lit torches in wall sconces throughout the library. Unless
  otherwise described, the library is in [rules]Bright Light[/rules].
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override" id="Doors">Doors</h3>
<p>
  The library contains various secret and locked doors. See the rules for doors in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>. All secret doors are
  standard (DC 15). All locked doors have Simple locks (1 action to pick) of Good quality (DC 15).
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override" id="GoblinKnowledge">Goblin Knowledge</h3>
<p>
  A character who interrogates a goblin or hobgoblin and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma
  ([skill]Intimidation[/skill] or [skill]Persuasion[/skill]) check learns the following.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Powell.</em></strong> The goblins and hobgoblins work for Powell, whom they call
  “Owl-Face” and consider “a mighty wizard.” Powell arrived at the library a day ago and has been
  exploring it. Powell posted the goblins and hobgoblins on the upper level and instructed them to
  kill intruders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Powell’s Lackeys.</em></strong> Powell has Zhentarim guards who followed her to the
  lower level, and a few goblins accompanied her as well.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Upper-Floor Layout.</em></strong> The goblin and hobgoblin mercenaries know the layout
  of the library’s upper floor. They avoid the bear in area 3 and the trapped statue in area 6.

<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Adoorstandsajar">
  <p>
    A door stands ajar in the north wall of this room, and a hole has been dug in the east wall. A
    goblin stands on watch, while other goblins talk and rest nearby. An open cage fills the
    southwest corner of the room, and a large wolflike creature lies curled up in the cage.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The four [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] posted in this room were told to not
  allow anyone inside the library. One watches the entrance and the tunnel to area 3. One is asleep
  in a corner. The other two sit together, eating and telling stories. A [monsters]Worg[/monsters],
  allied to the goblins, lies curled up half-asleep in the cage. The cage’s door is unlocked and
  open.
</p>
<p>
  When the goblins spot intruders, they stand and draw their weapons. Read or paraphrase the
  following:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thisaintnoplace">
  <p>
    “This ain’t no place for visitors,” one goblin says, “so turn right around, march yourself out
    of here, and don’t come back.” As the goblin talks, the wolflike creature rises in the cage,
    stretching and yawning.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>If the party doesn’t retreat, the goblins and worg begin combat.</p>
<p>
  If the gate to the cage shuts, it locks. The cage is centuries old, and none of the goblins have
  the key. As a [action]Utilize[/action] action, a character can try to pick the lock using Thieves’
  Tools, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([skill]Sleight of Hand[/skill]) check. Bending
  open the old iron bars of the cage requires a creature to make a successful DC 20 Strength
  ([skill]Athletics[/skill]) check as an action. The cage’s bars are wide enough that Small
  creatures can slip between them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each goblin has 1d6 GP in its pockets.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="2Barrack">2: Barrack</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thisoldbarrack">
  <p>
    This old barrack contains four humble beds. At the foot of each bed is an old, shabby storage
    locker. A corridor north is blocked by an iron portcullis. On the far side of the bars, near a
    closed door, a winch is mounted on the wall.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>The library’s guards once lived here, but now this room is abandoned.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Portcullis.</em></strong> The portcullis to the north is a Medium iron portcullis (see
  chapter 3 of the <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>). The winch
  can’t be reached or operated from the south side of the bars. Characters might solve this problem
  with spells like [spells]Mage Hand[/spells] or [spells]Unseen Servant[/spells]. Once the
  portcullis is lifted, a lever can be flipped on the winch, locking the bars in place.
</p>
<p>The door north leads to area 8. It is closed but unlocked.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="3Cavern">3: Cavern</h4>
<p>
  This chamber is in Darkness. The description below assumes the characters have a light source or
  other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Awindingtunnel">
  <p>
    A winding tunnel ends in a large natural cavern. A stream breaks through the western wall and
    cuts a curving arc through the cavern, exiting through a hole in the south wall. A hole in the
    north wall reveals a smaller adjacent cave, and a tunnel winds away to the northeast. A large
    brown bear rises from the stream. A fish drops from the bear’s mouth to the water as it roars!
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Centuries ago, creatures from the Underdark followed the stream’s path into this cavern and dug
  tunnels connecting to areas 1 and 5. The stream’s tunnel is no longer navigable.
</p>
<p>
  This cavern is now claimed by a <strong>[monsters]Brown Bear[/monsters].</strong> The bear is
  Hostile to intruders but doesn’t immediately fight them, instead attempting to deter the party
  with its roar. As an [action]Influence[/action] action, a character can try calming the bear and
  make a DC 13 Wisdom ([skill]Animal Handling[/skill]) check, changing its attitude to Indifferent
  on a successful check. If the characters can’t calm the bear and don’t retreat, the bear begins
  combat. It doesn’t enter areas 2 or 5, avoiding the goblins and hobgoblins there.
</p>
<p>If the bear is calmed, it retreats to area 4 and allows the party to move through area 3.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Characters searching the cavern find skeletal remains in the
  shallow stream. Among these remains is a [magicitems]Clockwork Amulet[/magicitems].
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="4Den">4: Den</h4>
<p>This chamber reeks of animal scent and is where the bear in area 3 sleeps.</p>
<p>
  If the party succeeds in calming or negotiating with the bear, the bear retreats here and guards
  its den against intruders. It growls to warn characters who try to enter the den and initiates
  combat if the characters do so anyway.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="5SupplyRoom">5: Supply Room</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thissquarechamber">
  <p>
    This square chamber is filled with crates and stacks of supplies, including flat wooden slats,
    simple leather, and parchment. A hallway leads north out of the chamber. Three armed hobgoblins
    methodically search the crates.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  This room contains decrepit supplies for bookbinding, copying, and other library tasks. A space
  along the western wall, where a secret door is located, has been cleared of crates.
</p>
<p>
  Three [monsters]Hobgoblin Warrior;Hobgoblin Warriors[/monsters] search the crates. Originally
  posted in area 6, they ran afoul of the trap there and wandered here hoping to find something
  valuable. The hobgoblins are distracted, and if the characters succeed on DC 10 Dexterity
  ([skill]Stealth[/skill]) checks, they can surprise the hobgoblins. When the hobgoblins spot the
  characters, they begin combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If two of the hobgoblins are defeated, the third attempts
  to flee through the secret door to area 8 and alert the goblins there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each hobgoblin has 1d8 GP in its pockets. One crate contains
  nine bottles of Ink, and a small wooden box contains six sticks of incense worth 10 GP each.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="6DisplayRoom">6: Display Room</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Displayshelvesline">
  <p>
    Display shelves line this large room, and a central table is crowded with knickknacks large and
    small, including a glass sphere glowing with silver light. A large, intimidating iron statue of
    a wolf stands in the southeast corner, and a corridor exits from the northwest. Words are
    written above both entrances to the room.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  This room is filled with mementos of Lethchauntos’s life and family. The wolf statue is a
  dangerous trap, and the glass sphere imprisons a creature; see below for more on both. The words
  written above the entrances are in the Orc language and read, “The wolf does not bite the hand
  that feeds it.” This is a clue to avoiding or disarming the trap.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Trap.</em></strong> The wolf statue is a magical trap. If a creature touches the table
  or anything on it—including the glass sphere—without first disarming the trap, the statue fills
  the room with toxic gas. Each creature in the room when the trap activates makes a DC 11
  Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
  a successful one. The trap resets after 1 minute.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Disarming the Trap.</em></strong> A tiny switch is hidden in the mouth of the statue.
  Anyone who inspects the mouth of the statue or reaches into the mouth finds the switch and can
  flip it, disabling the trap.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Glass Sphere.</em></strong> The glass sphere is an enchanted prison for Regret—a
  Celestial, Neutral Good <strong>Empyrean Iota</strong> embodying a faded memory of Mystra, a deity
  of magic. Lethchauntos imprisoned the iota in the sphere long ago and accidentally abandoned it
  when he left. The sphere has 1 Hit Point and breaks if dropped or thrown at the ground. If the
  sphere breaks, Regret is freed.
</p>
<p>
  If a character approaches the sphere, it pulses faintly with silver light. A character touching
  the sphere makes contact with Regret’s mind and hears the words, “Set me free, I beg you!” in
  their mind.
</p>
<p>
  Regret can communicate mentally with anyone touching the sphere. It pleads with the characters to
  break the sphere and free it, promising to use its powers on their behalf, but it refuses to carry
  out evil actions. If Regret is freed, it makes good on its promise, assisting the characters with
  any encounters on this level of the library, including area 8. Regret won’t go further into the
  library, and after assisting the characters for up to 1 day, it flees the library.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Most of the items displayed here are personal items of no
  significant value. There are three objects of note, however, on the table: a diamond worth 50 GP,
  a vial of Holy Water, and a gilded acorn worth 200 GP. The acorn contains a feather, a tuft of
  fur, and a fish scale. This acorn can be used with the summoning circle in area 9.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Experience Points.</em></strong> If the party frees Regret, award each character a
  bonus 75 XP.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="7GuestQuarters">7: Guest Quarters</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thedooropenstoreveal">
  <p>
    The door opens to reveal a bed chamber containing musty furniture. A second door stands on the
    far wall.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Powell and her goblin minions know about this room but have no reason to come here, entering the
  rotunda (area 8) through area 2 or 5. This room is therefore safer than other parts of the
  library. If the party shuts the door and doesn’t attract attention, they can rest here without
  being disturbed.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="8Rotunda">8: Rotunda</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thismagnificentcircularlibrary">
  <p>
    This magnificent, circular library is filled with thousands of books, including one displayed in
    a glass case. A balcony even with the upper level circles the gallery, eventually descending to
    the library floor by way of a handsome staircase. Several goblins pull books off the shelves,
    throwing them onto a large pile in the middle of the room, where a well-armed goblin holding a
    tinderbox stands. “Hurry up,” this goblin says. “I’m getting cold, and nothing drives off the
    chill like a nice, big bonfire.”
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The goblin lighting the fire is Glaxby, a <strong>[monsters]Goblin Boss[/monsters].</strong> Four
  [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] in the room do as Glaxby commands. The goblins
  don’t notice characters on the upper level of the rotunda.
</p>
<p>
  Once he sees the party, Glaxby orders the other goblins into battle. If Glaxby or three of the
  goblins warriors are defeated, the survivors flee the library.

<p>The following locations are keyed to map 7.2.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="9SummoningChamber">9: Summoning Chamber</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Asilvercircleinscribed">
  <p>
    A silver circle inscribed on the floor and decorated with magical runes fills this chamber.
    Voices can be heard through a door on the west wall. A thick, heavy curtain hangs in the room’s
    northeast corner.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The curtain depicts a rough map of the Dalelands, but it is centuries old and thus inaccurate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Summoning Circle.</em></strong> The circle on the floor is magical. As a
  [action]Study[/action] action, a character can inspect it and make a DC 15 Intelligence
  ([skill]Arcana[/skill]) check, discerning how to use it on a successful check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Using the Circle.</em></strong> A character with proficiency in the
  [skill]Arcana[/skill] skill can take a [action]Magic[/action] action to touch the circle and cast
  the [spells]Summon Beast[/spells] spell. The creature must provide the spell’s Material component,
  which can be found in area 6. When cast using the circle, the spell summons only a Land spirit
  (which resembles a wolf) and doesn’t require [rules]Concentration[/rules], instead lasting for the
  full duration. Once the circle has been used to cast the spell, it can’t be used this way again
  for 2d4 days.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="10MeditationAlcove">10: Meditation Alcove</h4>
<p>
  This room is in Darkness. The description below assumes the characters have a light source or
  other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Anoldpillow">
  <p>
    An old pillow rests on a reed mat in the center of this long, narrow chamber. Near the mat lies
    a small cloth bag.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Lethchauntos used this room to meditate before performing magic in area 9. The latch that opens
  the secret door in the southeast corner is locked. The key to this lock is in Lethchauntos’s
  chamber (area 17).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The cloth bag contains rune stones marked with letters in the
  Orc language. They’re worth a total of 25 GP and can be used as the Material component for the
  [spells]Augury[/spells] spell.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="11Vault">11: Vault</h4>
<p>
  This room is in Darkness. The description below assumes the characters have a light source or
  other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Atablecrowded">
  <p>A table crowded with bottles and jars stands in the center of this small, round chamber.</p>
</aside>
<p>
  This was Lethchauntos’s secure vault, where he kept various treasures and expensive Material
  components.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Two [magicitems]Potion of Healing;Potions of
  Healing[/magicitems] stand on the table. In addition, three jars contain valuable Material
  components. The first contains 50 GP worth of jade dust. The second contains 100 GP worth of gold
  dust. The third contains 200 GP worth of ruby dust.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="12SittingRoom">12: Sitting Room</h4>
<p>
  When approaching a door to this room, characters with a Passive Perception score of 12 or higher
  hear three voices chatting in Common. The voices discuss their friend Erik, who went to use the
  privy in area 15 but hasn’t returned. (Erik was eaten by the mimic now lurking in area 13). Read
  or paraphrase the following:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Inthissimpleroom">
  <p>
    In this simple room, three humans sit around a table littered with a pile of coins. One of the
    three has dice in their hand, and the others watch expectantly. A fourth chair at the table is
    empty.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Three human Zhents (Medium [monsters]Zhentilar Soldier;Zhentilar Soldiers[/monsters]; see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary#ZhentilarSoldier">chapter 9</a>) gamble at the table. When
  the characters open a door into the room, the Zhents see them, grab weapons, and initiate combat.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The Zhents’ wealth lies on the table: 10 GP, 7 EP, and 50 SP.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="13PowellsBedroom">13: Powell’s Bedroom</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Asinglebedfills13">
  <p>
    A single bed fills one corner of this small room, a chest at its foot. A desk with a chair
    stands in the southeast corner. In the southwest corner stands a short, bulging, colorfully
    painted armoire.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Powell claimed this bedroom for herself. What she doesn’t know is the armoire is a shape-shifted
  <strong>[monsters]Mimic[/monsters].</strong> This creature was hiding in the privy (area 15) but
  moved here after murdering Erik, one of Powell’s Zhentarim soldiers, and devouring the corpse.
</p>
<p>
  A character who takes a [action]Search[/action] action to inspect the room and succeeds on a DC 10
  Wisdom ([skill]Perception[/skill]) check spots streaks of blood on the armoire’s surface and in
  the entrance to the room.
</p>
<p>
  The mimic begins combat if a creature touches it. Otherwise, the mimic remains in the shape of an
  armoire, digesting its meal, unless the characters begin combat with it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Powell has put some of her belongings in the chest. Most of
  these items are of no value, but a leather scroll case contains a [magicitems]Spell
  Scroll[/magicitems] of [spells]Identify[/spells], a [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of
  [spells]Locate Object[/spells], and a pearl worth 100 GP.

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="14EmptyBedroom">14: Empty Bedroom</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Asinglebedfills14">
  <p>
    A single bed fills one corner of this small room, a chest at its foot. A desk with a chair
    stands in the southeast corner. The air smells old and stale.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  This bedroom is empty. Its furnishings are identical to those in area 13, with the exception of
  thearmoire.
</p>
<p>
  Neither Powell nor her followers have reason to enter this room. The party can rest here
  undisturbed if they keep quiet.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="15Privy">15: Privy</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thissmalldank">
  <p>
    This small, dank chamber has a sitting-level wooden plank with a hole at its center. Blood is
    spattered across the floor and walls.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The mimic in area 13 hid here earlier. When Erik, one of Powell’s Zhentarim allies, took a privy
  break, the mimic killed and devoured him before moving to area 13.
</p>
<p>
  A character who takes a [action]Search[/action] action to trace the bloodstains and succeeds on a
  DC 10 Wisdom ([skill]Survival[/skill]) check can follow the trail of blood to area 13.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="16Gallery">16: Gallery</h4>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thewallsofthislarge">
  <p>
    The walls of this large, spacious chamber are decorated with frescoes that depict a venerable
    orc in black robes. The long, curving northeast wall shows the orc forging a peculiar axe with
    blades on both ends. The southern wall shows the same orc stocking a grand library with books.
    Finally, the west wall depicts the orc scribing a book filled with magical runes. An actual book
    identical to the one in the fresco rests face-out on a shelf on this wall, blending with the
    painting. Six columns support the ceiling.
  </p>
  <p>
    A tall, thin human in a voluminous cloak inspects the book on the shelf, while an armed human
    looks on. A few bored goblins wander among the columns.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The book on the shelf is the <em>Nathlum.</em> The tall, thin human is Powell “the Owl” (Medium,
  Neutral Evil [monsters]Mage Apprentice[/monsters]; knows the Goblin language). She recognizes the
  <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a> but is afraid to touch it, suspecting the book is trapped.
  Powell is accompanied by a human Zhentarim bodyguard (Medium [monsters]Zhentilar
  Soldier[/monsters]; see <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary#ZhentilarSoldier">chapter 9</a>) and
  three <strong>[monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>If she or her followers detect the party, Powell turns to the characters and speaks:</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Youmustbeworking">
  <p>
    “You must be working for Myrna,” the tall human says, blinking slowly at you with wide eyes.
    “Well, congratulations. It’s really quite remarkable you’ve gotten this far. But I haven’t come
    all this way to surrender the <em>Nathlum</em> now. Leave now, and consider yourselves lucky.”
  </p>
</aside>
<p>If the characters don’t retreat, Powell and her followers initiate combat.</p>
<p>
  Powell attempts to flee if her Zhentarim bodyguard is killed. She heads for area 12, where she
  expects to find more Zhentarim allies. If that proves impossible or if the soldiers in area 12 are
  dead, she flees the dungeon instead. If the characters prevent Powell’s escape or she is reduced
  to 10 Hit Points or fewer, she surrenders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The <em>Nathlum</em> rests on a shelf on the west wall; see
  “<a href="#TheNathlum">The Nathlum</a>” later in this chapter for details on the book. Powell has
  15 GP in a belt pouch. The Zhentarim bodyguard has 10 GP, and the goblins have 1d6 GP each.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="17LethchauntossChamber">17: Lethchauntos’s Chamber</h4>
<p>
  This room is in Darkness. Powell and her followers haven’t yet investigated it. The description
  below assumes the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thishandsomebedchamber">
  <p>
    This handsome bedchamber is decorated all in black, with black tapestries lining the walls, a
    black canopy over a large enclosed bed, and a stout black wooden bed stand. A black armoire
    stands in one corner.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  This was Lethchauntos’s bedroom. A journal, written in the Orc language, lies in a drawer in the
  bed stand. The journal relates the information from “Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life.”
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The armoire is filled with robes and other black clothing. On
  a shelf in the armoire is a key that opens the doors to areas 11 and 19, as well as a platinum
  ring worth 50 GP. This was Lethchauntos’s wedding ring, and it matches the ring in area 19.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="18Forge">18: Forge</h4>
<p>
  This room is in Darkness. Powell hasn’t come here yet. The description below assumes the
  characters have a light source or other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<figure id="imgoflethchauntosstocked" class="compendium-art compendium-art-center">

  [s3compimg]fraif/mYHBzcAm7DEVWmcR/07-004.lethchauntos-stocked.png;center;850;[/s3compimg]
  <figcaption>Lethchauntos stocked the library with books</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Thislongnarrowroom">
  <p>
    This long, narrow room was once a forge, but its fires are long cold. An anvil stands at the far
    end, and hammers, tongs, and other tools hang from a rack on one wall. Resting on the anvil is a
    greataxe.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>This was Lethchauntos’s forge. He used it to forge the greataxe resting on the anvil.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The axe has a long, straight haft with a metal grip and a
  leather loop at the end. The double-bladed axe head is symmetrical and angular, each blade
  resembling a giant arrowhead. The axe is <em>Lethchauntos’s Legacy</em>, a sentient
  [magicitems]Greataxe, \+1;+1 Greataxe[/magicitems]. <em>Lethchauntos’s Legacy</em> has
  Intelligence 10, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 13, and it is Neutral Good. It communicates by
  transmitting emotion to the creature carrying it, and it has hearing and [sense]Darkvision[/sense]
  out to 120 feet. The axe has a special purpose: to protect the family of its bearer. The axe
  considers especially close friends to be “found family” under its protection. The axe hasn’t been
  touched since Lethchauntos placed it here centuries ago, and it doesn’t know where its creator is
  now.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="19Chasm">19: Chasm</h4>
<p>
  The door to this room is locked; the key is in area 17. This area is in Darkness. The description
  below assumes the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in Darkness:
</p>
<aside class="text--quote-box" id="Awideledge">
  <p>
    A wide ledge extends into darkness. Beyond, a chasm stretches to the southeast. In the empty
    space, two small, circular platforms hang suspended by chains. On the far side of the chasm is
    another rocky ledge, where a small headstone stands.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Lethchauntos buried his wife at the south end of this chasm. That was long ago, however, and now
  the chasm is home to monstrous spiders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Webs.</em></strong> A thick layer of sticky webs created by spiders spreads across the
  chasm 70 feet below the ledge. A creature that can see in Darkness can see these webs from the
  ledge. A creature that falls from the ledge or platforms (see below) lands in the webs, taking no
  damage from the fall. A creature that lands in the webs or starts its turn there must succeed on a
  DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or have the [condition]Restrained[/condition] condition until the web
  in that creature’s space is destroyed. Each 5-foot square of web has AC 10, HP 5, Vulnerability to
  Fire damage, and Immunity to Psychic and Poison damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spiders.</em></strong> This chasm is a home to two [monsters]Giant Spider;Giant
  Spiders[/monsters] and two swarms of spiders ([monsters]Swarm of Insects;Swarms of
  Insects[/monsters]). The giant spiders lurk on the webs below the platforms (see below), while the
  swarms hide at the south end of the chasm. The spiders ambush any creature that falls into the web
  or reaches the south end of the chasm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Platforms.</em></strong> Three platforms used to bridge this chasm, but the middle
  platform collapsed long ago, leaving a treacherous space between the remaining two platforms. A
  creature that tries to leap between the platforms makes a DC 12 Dexterity
  ([skill]Acrobatics[/skill]) check, falling into the webs below on a failed check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Climbing Up.</em></strong> Climbing back up to the entrance or grave site from the
  webs below without a Climb speed requires a successful DC 10 Strength ([skill]Athletics[/skill])
  check. Creatures that fail this check fall back onto the webs. Once the spiders have been
  defeated, creatures climb back to safety without needing to make a check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Grave Site.</em></strong> The cliff on the far side of the chasm is home to a grave
  site. A simple square granite tombstone reads, in the Orc language, “Ona, Beloved Wife.”
  Lethchauntos’s wife is buried here.
</p>
<p>
  The tunnel leading south from the grave site eventually leads to the Underdark, but that is beyond
  the scope of this adventure.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A platinum ring rests on the gravestone. The ring is worth 50
  GP and is identical to the ring in area 17.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  If the party returns the <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a> to Myrna, she is overjoyed by their
  success and rewards each character with the promised 100 GP, asking them to relate everything
  they’ve discovered. She is especially glad if they have Lethchauntos’s journal, which supports
  Myrna’s theories about the wizard’s life. For completing their quest, each character gains 100 XP.
  The characters should now be level 3.
</p>
<p>
  If the party was successful, Myrna points out that Lethchauntos built four more libraries in
  different parts of Faerûn. Each awaits discovery, and who knows what mysteries they contain? You
  can design these libraries yourself, using the library described in this chapter as inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, chapters <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/running-the-realms/">1</a> through
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/baldurs-gate/">6</a> of this book include adventures, including
  several designed for level 3 characters that would be apt continuations from this adventure.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="TheNathlum">The Nathlum</h2>
<p>
  The <em>Nathlum</em> is a nondescript book with a gray canvas cover and parchment pages. It was
  written by Lethchauntos in Common. It contains two spells and the recipes for many poisons.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Nathlum</em> contains the [spells]Glyph of Warding[/spells] and [spells]Maze[/spells]
  spells. The book can’t be used to cast these spells, but a Wizard can copy these spells into their
  spellbook as described in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Nathlum</em> also contains the recipes for every poison in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>, plus four additional poisons
  described below. A character with the <em>Nathlum</em> can use a Poisoner’s Kit to craft any
  poison described in the book, using the rules for crafting equipment in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a>. The
  <em>Nathlum</em> also contains instructions for crafting [magicitems]Elixir of Health;Elixirs of
  Health[/magicitems] (see rules for crafting magic items in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>).
</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override with-metadata" id="Deathdance200GP">Deathdance (200 GP)</h3>
<p><em>Injury Poison</em></p>
<p>
  A creature subjected to Deathdance must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
  [condition]Poisoned[/condition] condition for 1 minute. Humanoids automatically succeed on this
  save. The creature also has the [condition]Incapacitated[/condition] condition while
  [condition]Poisoned[/condition] in this way, as it thrashes uncontrollably.
</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override with-metadata" id="Prespra300GP">Prespra (300 GP)</h3>
<p><em>Ingested Poison</em></p>
<p>
  A creature subjected to Prespra must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6)
  Poison damage and have the [condition]Poisoned[/condition] condition. The creature also has the
  [condition]Blinded[/condition] condition while [condition]Poisoned[/condition] in this way. The
  creature repeats the save at the start of each of its turns, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a
  failed save. On a successful save, the effect ends for the creature.
</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override with-metadata" id="Ulcrun1000GP">Ulcrun (1,000 GP)</h3>
<p><em>Injury Poison</em></p>
<p>
  A creature subjected to Ulcrun must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6)
  Poison damage and gain 1 [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level.
</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<h3 class="compendium-hr h4-override with-metadata" id="YellowDeath150GP">Yellow Death (150 GP)</h3>
<p><em>Ingested Poison</em></p>
<p>
  A creature subjected to Yellow Death makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
  the creature takes 14 (4d6) Poison damage and has the [condition]Poisoned[/condition] condition
  for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="CustomizingtheAdventure">Customizing the Adventure</h2>
<p>
  Lethchauntos built five libraries, one in each of these locations: the Dalelands, Icewind Dale,
  Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate. The library described in this chapter appears in
  the Dalelands, but you can customize the adventure to fit one of the other settings as described
  below.
</p>

    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="ui-droppable">
    <p>
      The Icewind Dale version of the adventure delves into the survival horror genre. Myrna calls
      the characters together in Bryn Shander. The library is dug into Kelvin’s Cairn. Powell found
      the library, cleared the door of ice and snow, and led a team inside, but encountered the
      undead corpses of previous explorers. Most of her followers are dead, but the undead remain
      active and hungry.
    </p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LibraryFeaturesIcewindDale">Library Features</h4>
    <p>
      The library has no light sources and is in Darkness throughout. Descriptions assume the
      characters have a light source or other means of seeing in Darkness.
    </p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="CorpsesandTreasure">Corpses and Treasure</h4>
    <p>
      Place ten fresh corpses anywhere in the library—these are followers of Powell who were killed
      by undead. Each corpse has 2d6 GP.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EncounterAreasIcewindDale">Encounter Areas</h4>
<p>Modify areas of the library in the following ways.</p>
<ul class="list--hidden">
  <li>
    <strong><em>1: Guard Station.</em></strong> Replace the goblins and worg with six
    <strong>[monsters]Zombie;Zombies[/monsters].</strong> If the zombies detect the characters, they
    begin combat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>3: Cavern.</em></strong> The bear is a polar bear, but a fungal infection carried by
    fish from the Underdark has weakened it (use the [monsters]Brown Bear[/monsters] stat block).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>5: Supply Room.</em></strong> Replace the hobgoblins with three
    [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters], followers of Powell who have barricaded themselves in this
    room. They want to get out of the library alive but are afraid to leave and are Hostile. They
    warn the party and begin combat if the characters don’t retreat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>6: Display Room.</em></strong> Replace Regret with a [monsters]Specter[/monsters]
    imprisoned in the glass sphere by Lethchauntos long ago. It communicates with anyone who touches
    the sphere, promising its aid, but it is lying. If the sphere is broken, the specter flees.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>8: Rotunda.</em></strong> Replace the goblins with two
    [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters] that hide on the ground floor of this room. The floor is
    littered with the corpses of Powell’s followers, some of whom have been meals for the ghouls.
    The ghouls attempt to ambush the party.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>12: Sitting Room.</em></strong> Replace the soldiers with three
    [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters] who lair here. The ghouls roam singly through areas 9–15 but
    don’t know about the vault (area 11). If one of them spots the party, it retreats to gather its
    fellows and plan an ambush.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>13: Powell’s Bedroom.</em></strong> The ghouls know the [monsters]Mimic[/monsters]
    is hiding here, but they ignore it. Move the treasure in this room to Powell, in area 16.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>14: Empty Bedroom.</em></strong> This room is no longer safe for characters to rest
    in; the ghouls in area 12 consider it part of their territory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>16: Gallery.</em></strong> Replace the three goblins with a human lackey (Medium
    [monsters]Tough[/monsters]). This follower and the Zhentarim bodyguard also in this room are all
    that remains of Powell’s allies. Powell tries to negotiate with the party, suggesting the two
    groups work together to escape the library, sell the <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a> to the
    Zhentarim, and split the money. If the party refuses, she initiates combat. If the party accepts
    her offer, she and her followers betray the party as soon as they leave the library.

      Adventures in Calimshan juxtapose desert isolation and the elemental magic of genies with the
      sophistication of Calimport and the [magicitems]Mechanical Wonder;Mechanical
      Wonders[/magicitems] found there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this version of the adventure, Myrna calls the characters together in Calimport.
      Lethchauntos’s library is in the Calim Desert. Powell has brought several mechanical soldiers
      to complement her Zhentarim allies but discovered elementals living in the library who were
      quick to defend it.
    </p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MechanicalSoldiers">Mechanical Soldiers</h4>
    <p>
      Replace all the [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] in the adventure with
      mechanical soldiers ([monsters]Modron Duodrone;Modron Duodrones[/monsters]). The mechanical
      warriors obey Powell without question and never retreat. A character searching a fallen
      soldier gathers 2d6 GP.
    </p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EncounterAreasCalimshan">Encounter Areas</h4>
    <p>Modify areas of the library in the following ways.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<ul class="list--hidden">
  <li>
    <strong><em>1: Guard Station.</em></strong> Replace the [monsters]Worg[/monsters] with a
    [monsters]Dust Mephit[/monsters] that has locked itself in the cage and is taunting the
    mechanical soldiers, which can’t reach it through the bars. The soldiers are distracted, but
    when they notice the characters, they begin combat. Once combat is underway, the mephit squeezes
    out between the bars of the cage and joins in the violence, fighting indiscriminately.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>3: Cavern.</em></strong> Replace the bear with a
    <strong>[monsters]Lion[/monsters].</strong> It behaves as described for the bear.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>5: Supply Room.</em></strong> Replace the hobgoblins with three [monsters]Dust
    Mephit;Dust Mephits[/monsters] that live in the library. They’ve defeated some mechanical
    soldiers and assume the characters are with Powell. Unless convinced otherwise, the mephits
    order the party to leave, initiating combat if the characters don’t comply.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>6: Display Room.</em></strong> Replace Regret with a [monsters]Sphinx of
    Wonder[/monsters] named Scirocco, imprisoned in the glass sphere by Lethchauntos long ago.
    Scirocco pleads with the characters to be released and assists them if freed, under the same
    restrictions Regret would have. Scirocco is obsessed with the Calim Desert and might accompany
    the party longer if they agree to help it learn about the desert.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>8: Rotunda.</em></strong> Replace the [monsters]Goblin Boss[/monsters] with
    <strong>[monsters]Animated Armor[/monsters].</strong> It and the mechanical soldiers stand
    motionless on the lower level, but when they notice the party, they initiate combat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>13: Powell’s Bedroom.</em></strong> Replace the Mimic with an [monsters]Animated Rug
    of Smothering[/monsters] that obeys Powell’s commands. The carpet murdered Erik when he snuck
    into this room and tried to steal Powell’s treasure. If the characters try to do the same, it
    ambushes them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>18: Forge.</em></strong> An [monsters]Azer Sentinel[/monsters] named Falchia lives
    and works in this room, which is in [rules]Bright Light[/rules] from the active forge. Falchia
    assisted Lethchauntos in crafting <em>Lethchauntos’s Legacy</em> but now considers the forge to
    be hers. Falchia speaks to the party if any of them know Primordial (Ignan), telling them of the
    weapon’s making. She wants to see <em>Lethchauntos’s Legacy</em> used by heroic individuals and
    offers the party the weapon. If unable to communicate with the characters, Falchia gestures to
    the greataxe and allows the characters to take it, then resumes working the forge.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>19: Chasm.</em></strong> The tunnel leading south away from this room gets hotter
    and hotter, eventually ending in a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="flexible-double-column">
  <div class="ui-droppable">
    <p>
      Adventures in the Moonshae Isles often involve Fey creatures and the Rusting. Clever
      adventurers often use diplomacy to avoid violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this version of the adventure, Myrna brings the characters together at Caer Calidyrr. The
      entrance to the library is near the moonwell in the northwest corner of the Dernall Forest.
      The library itself, however, is in the Feywild. Anyone who passes through the door finds
      themself in the library south of area 1. Powell found the door and led her followers through,
      where she found bullywugs and other fey living in the library.
    </p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Bullywugs">Bullywugs</h4>
    <p>
      Replace all the [monsters]Goblin Warrior;Goblin Warriors[/monsters] in the adventure with
      <strong>[monsters]Bullywug Warrior;Bullywug Warriors[/monsters].</strong> These bullywugs
      revere Lethchauntos as a mighty mage and consider the <em>Nathlum</em> a sacred object, but
      they don’t know much about Lethchauntos, and they’ve never dared touch the book.

  Powell has convinced the bullywugs that intruders are coming to steal the <em>Nathlum</em> and
  that she’s here to help the bullywugs defend it.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EncounterAreasMoonshaeIsles">Encounter Areas</h4>
<p>Modify areas of the library in the following ways.</p>
<ul class="list--hidden">
  <li>
    <strong><em>1: Guard Station.</em></strong> The bullywugs are awake and alert. Replace the
    [monsters]Worg[/monsters] with two [monsters]Giant Frog;Giant Frogs[/monsters] that obey the
    bullywugs. The bullywugs immediately fight the characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>3: Cavern.</em></strong> The bear has signs of the Rusting. This doesn’t affect its
    stat block. The curse was carried by the stream, which is tinted with rust from the Moonshae
    Isles and has a metallic smell. There’s little the characters can do for the bear, but a
    character who tries to help it has Advantage on Wisdom ([skill]Animal Handling[/skill]) checks
    to calm it. The tunnel south leads to the Feywild.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>5: Supply Room.</em></strong> Replace the hobgoblins with three
    [monsters]Satyr;Satyrs[/monsters] recuperating here after a night of revelry. Powell charged the
    satyrs with driving the characters out of the library, but the satyrs are Indifferent to the
    party and don’t much feel like fighting. If spoken to, they tell the party about Powell and the
    poison gas trap in area 6, which they don’t know how to deactivate. They won’t join the
    characters, insisting they have terrible headaches.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>6: Display Room.</em></strong> Replace Regret with a [monsters]Faerie Dragon
    Youth[/monsters] named Precocia, imprisoned in the glass sphere by Lethchauntos long ago.
    Precocia can communicate with anyone who touches the glass sphere. If freed, it accompanies and
    helps the party.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>8: Rotunda.</em></strong> This room is surrounded by large magical windows that
    reveal the Feywild outside the library. Replace the [monsters]Goblin Boss[/monsters] with a
    [monsters]Giant Toad[/monsters] that obeys the bullywugs, who lie in wait for the party. As soon
    as they see the characters, the bullywugs ambush them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>12: Sitting Room.</em></strong> Characters eavesdropping on the soldiers hear them
    boast about how Powell has tricked the bullywugs into serving her by claiming to protect the
    <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a>, when she intends to steal it. The soldiers are cowards; if
    the party surprises them, they surrender.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>13: Powell’s Bedroom.</em></strong> Replace the [monsters]Mimic[/monsters] with a
    [monsters]Bulette Pup[/monsters], which burrowed into the privy (area 15) and killed Erik before
    retreating to this room and hiding under the bed. The bulette isn’t aggressive and flees if the
    characters try to fight it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>16: Gallery.</em></strong> Powell is here with her bodyguard and three Hostile
    <strong>[monsters]Bullywug Warrior;Bullywug Warriors[/monsters].</strong> Powell confidently
    orders her bullywug minions and bodyguard to fight. As an [action]Influence[/action] action, a
    character can try to convince the bullywugs that Powell is lying to them and make a DC 13
    Charisma ([skill]Persuasion[/skill]) check. On a successful check, the bullywugs turn their
    weapons on Powell. If this happens, or if her Zhentarim bodyguard is killed, Powell surrenders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>19: Chasm.</em></strong> The tunnel leading south from this area leads to the
    Feywild instead of the Underdark.

<p>
  Adventures in Baldur’s Gate often involve temptation by devils and questionable alliances with
  morally ambiguous individuals. The influence of the Dead Three is never far away.
</p>
<p>
  In this version of the adventure, Myrna brings the characters together at the Helm and Cloak. The
  library is located in the sewers beneath the city. Powell intends to sell the
  <a href="#TheNathlum">Nathlum</a> to patriars who belong to devil-worshiping cults, but some of
  her followers secretly answer to the Dead Three instead, and others have been killed by monsters
  living in the sewers.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EncounterAreasBaldursGate">Encounter Areas</h4>
<p>Modify areas of the library in the following ways.</p>
<ul class="list--hidden">
  <li>
    <strong><em>1: Guard Station.</em></strong> Powell left guards here, but most of them have been
    killed by six [monsters]Troglodyte;Troglodytes[/monsters] that are still here, eating the dead.
    If disturbed, they begin combat. One of Powell’s followers, a human named Bors (Medium
    [monsters]Cultist[/monsters]), cowers in the locked cage. If freed, he admits to being one of
    Powell’s followers but asks only to be allowed to escape.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>3: Cavern.</em></strong> Replace the bear with a [monsters]Ghoul[/monsters] named
    Slymon. Slymon is Indifferent to the party, and will let them pass if they agree to bring him a
    Humanoid corpse he can eat. If the party refuses, he initiates combat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>5: Supply Room.</em></strong> Replace the hobgoblins with six of Powell’s human
    followers (Medium [monsters]Cultist;Cultists[/monsters]) searching the crates for supplies. They
    fight the characters. If outnumbered by the party, the survivors try to flee to area 8.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>6: Display Room.</em></strong> Replace Regret with an [monsters]Imp[/monsters] named
    Bitterbite, imprisoned in the glass sphere by Lethchauntos long ago. Bitterbite pleads to be
    released. If freed, the devil helps the characters as a way to help itself, ingratiating itself
    to the party at every opportunity. If ever in serious danger, Bitterbite flees.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>8: Rotunda.</em></strong> Replace the goblins with six of Powell’s human followers
    (Medium [monsters]Cultist;Cultists[/monsters]) and their human leader (Medium
    [monsters]Spy[/monsters]). They’re searching the books for anything of value and are loyal to
    Powell. They fight the characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>12: Sitting Room.</em></strong> Replace the [monsters]Zhentilar Soldier;Zhentilar
    Soldiers[/monsters] with human pirates (Medium [monsters]Pirate;Pirates[/monsters]). They came
    here with Powell but have grown bored and pass time with games of chance. The pirates aren’t
    loyal to Powell and can be bribed to leave peacefully with an offer of at least 10 GP total. If
    two of them are killed in battle, the third surrenders and begs for mercy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>13: Powell’s Bedroom.</em></strong> Remove the mimic from this room; see area 15
    below for a replacement monster.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>15: Privy.</em></strong> A [monsters]Carrion Crawler[/monsters] squeezed its way up
    the privy, destroying the wooden board covering the hole in the process. It was discovered by a
    pirate from area 12 and killed him. It is still here, clinging to the ceiling and slowly
    devouring the corpse. It fights intruders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>16: Gallery.</em></strong> The party arrives just in time to see Powell betrayed by
    Aglanna (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Cultist Fanatic[/monsters]), who is pretending to be her
    bodyguard but really serving one of the Dead Three. Aglanna stabs Powell in the back, killing
    her, and seizes the <em>Nathlum.</em> She is served by a [monsters]Manes Vaporspawn[/monsters]
    and six human followers (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Cultist;Cultists[/monsters]). Aglanna
    offers the characters twice what Myrna is paying them (200 GP each) to let her leave with the
    <em>Nathlum.</em> If the party agrees, she is true to her word. If they refuse, she and her
    allies begin combat.
  </li>
</ul>
