  to the west and the Sunrise Mountains to the east on a world called Toril. A place of varied
  cultures and peoples, Faerûn contains diverse realms, including kingdoms, city-states, and
  carefully maintained alliances of rural communities. While many of these realms are ruled by
  humans, who are the most populous species in Faerûn today, people of all sorts—including
  dragonborn, goliaths, orcs, tieflings, and more— mingle in those realms, as well as mountainous
  dwarven kingdoms, hidden elven enclaves, and other communities. Except in the most remote or
  insular places, Faerûnians are accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and
  species.

<p data-content-chunk-id="d968836c-42b2-4d56-8420-91c6a38d1f17">
  A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms. The routes between cities and nations often
  cross into the territory of brigands or marauding monsters. Every forest, swamp, and mountain
  range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, malicious fey, or mighty creatures such as
  giants and dragons. Ruins of ancient, forgotten realms dot the landscape, and these ruins often
  conceal expansive subterranean dungeons that wind beneath the surface. In these places, long-lost
  treasures await intrepid adventurers.

<p data-content-chunk-id="d063713c-70c8-4ffd-ba78-f6761fd7f01c">
  Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but day-to-day life
  in Faerûn is that of a medieval society. Rural farmers grow food and herd livestock that gets sent
  to market in towns and cities, where crafters and other tradesfolk gather. News and gossip are
  carried by caravans, ships, and traveling minstrels. Adventurers also spread news—when they’re not
  creating it!
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53487ebe-0c96-47d3-9258-d3a3848fcafc">
  Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn.
  Only the more educated or well traveled among the populace are aware that Faerûn is but one
  continent and that Toril is the whole of the world. For most, “Faerûn” is quite large enough.

  Although a number of means exist for marking the days and the passage of time during a year,
  nearly all folk in Faerûn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab9ec640-91ee-4ed9-ae85-fe97ec6b1c1b">
  In the Calendar of Harptos, a year on Toril consists of 365 days, divided into twelve months of
  thirty days, loosely following the cycle of Selûne, the moon. A month is made up of three tendays,
  also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling between the months, complete the calendar. Once
  every four years, Shieldmeet occurs as a leap day following Midsummer.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="21cdbd37-ddea-4fdf-bcb3-b2198656c3bd">
  Individual days of a tenday have no special names. Instead, they are denoted by counting from the
  beginning of the period (“first day,” “second day,” and so on). Days of the month are designated
  by a number and the month name (for example, “1 Mirtul” or “27 Uktar”). People might also refer to
  a given day by its relationship to the current date (“two tendays from today”) or the nearest
  holiday (“three days past Greengrass”).

  Every realm, faith, and culture across Faerûn has its own special festivals and holidays, the
  observances of which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, the stars, or some other
  event. In addition, the Calendar of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the changing
  of the seasons and one quadrennial festival that are observed in almost every land, with
  particular celebrations varying based on local traditions and popular faiths.

  Most people don’t keep track of the time of day beyond notions such as “midmorning” or “near

  expressions.

  The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical
  clocks are often unreliable and rarely set consistently. If a local temple or civic structure has
  a clock that tolls the passing of the hours, people refer to hours as “bells,” as in “I’ll meet
  you at seven bells.”

    <li>
      <strong>Dawn Age (–30000 DR to –24000 DR).</strong> The empires of the creator-races fade,
      replaced by realms of dragons and giants. These two great peoples wage mighty war for
      centuries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>First Flowering (–24000 DR to –12000 DR).</strong> Elven civilizations supplant those
      of the dragons and giants. In –17600, elven high magic creates
      <a href="#Evermeet">Evermeet</a> and brings a cataclysm to Toril known as the Sundering.

      generations.

      empires—spread across and dominate Faerûn.

      against each other.

  Nearly every major power of Faerûn has its own currency minted within its borders that represent
  both its influence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composition and standard weight are
  accepted across the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers to mint every sort of

  Adventurers have a long history in Faerûn. Children are told stories of great adventurers like
  Storm Silverhand, Drizzt Do’Urden, and Alias. While most people eventually put away their dreams
  of heroic adventure in favor of more practical matters, a few leave their homes to embark on a
  life of peril, hoping to become heroes who find great rewards. Individuals who suffer great
  tragedy in their lives might turn to adventuring out of desperation. Some adventurers are forced
  into the occupation when they or others are placed in sudden danger. A few individuals simply grow
  bored with their lives and dream of something more, becoming adventurers to reinvent themselves or
  find new meaning in their lives.

  An adventurer willing to risk their life on behalf of a complete stranger deserves applause and a

  But adventurers are also dangerous, possessing skills and magic beyond the reach of Faerûn’s
  common folk. Their lives are violent, and where they go, chaos follows. Many adventuring parties
  have descended into an ancient crypt only to unwittingly release a horrifying evil on an
  unsuspecting world. And a successful adventurer amasses wealth and power very quickly—perhaps too
  quickly for rulers to monitor or for the law to handle.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1ed92016-e85c-4c62-8fd4-309549554e37">
  Regardless, authority figures often turn to adventurers to solve unusual problems. Towns and
  cities typically have a budget set aside for hiring adventurers.

  Despite the harsh conditions in Anauroch, people still eke out an existence there. Remnants of
  Netheril returned from a long retreat to the Shadowfell and resettled with designs on spreading
  their power and influence once again. Nomadic peoples adapted to the trials of the region travel
  and live comfortably within the wastes. Travelers and fortune seekers from afar also carve out a
  niche in the desert, seeking fortunes and relics of the past beneath the sands and ice.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="010e5fc9-8ff1-4786-a912-cb9e38852ddd">
  Adventures in Anauroch include themes of survival, for the struggle against the brutal conditions
  never relaxes. In addition to the harsh climate, vicious creatures call the wastelands home,
  jealously guarding the lost magic and knowledge of the realms that rose and fell in the region’s
  past.

  desert was once the lush, thriving seat of the empire of Netheril. In the wake of the empire’s

<p data-content-chunk-id="c61b0a82-b3ed-4d38-8a0b-a5d843046b40">
  The nomadic Bedine people have lived in Anauroch for centuries, traveling from oasis to oasis,
  living in tents, and following small herds of desert-dwelling animals. Most tribes live in the
  region known as the Sword and number around a hundred people, encountering another tribe only once
  or twice a year. Their knowledge of the desert and hardy survival skills command respect.

  <a href="#Anauroch" data-content-chunk-id="0c8d2245-d765-4b62-ad31-6616a3fd29ed">Anauroch</a> is
  littered with the ruins of the ancient empire of Netheril, which fell in a magical cataclysm
  almost 3,000 years ago. Some of these ruins lie frozen in ice, their magical secrets preserved and
  waiting for Netherese survivors—or bold adventurers—to discover them. In the Year of Wild Magic
  (1372 DR), the Netherese flying city of Thultanthar, also called the City of Shade, emerged from
  the Shadowfell, where it had lain hidden for centuries. Its rulers, calling themselves Shadovar,
  began rebuilding their long-lost empire and even returning life and growth to the desert.
  Thultanthar fell in 1487 DR, crashing in Myth Drannor (see “<a
    href="#Heartlands"

  working to re-create the fallen city near the Shoal of Thirst.

  <strong><em>Shade.</em></strong> The former city of Thultanthar, capital of the Empire of Shade,
  was a magical flying marvel. After it crashed, survivors of the empire built a new settlement on
  the slopes of the Scimitar Spires, overlooking the Shoal of Thirst. Though this city, called
  Shade, can’t yet fly, it is inspired by old Thultanthar, and it resembles a piece of the
  Shadowfell transplanted to Faerûn. Its lightless avenues and sunless courtyards are shrouded in
  impenetrable gloom despite the desert’s glaring sun, providing a comfortable home for the city’s
  Shadovar rulers. Most explorers and traders avoid the city, as the Shadovar attack intruders.

<p data-content-chunk-id="4003299c-9ca5-4a05-b8c9-ad2e0219bd98">
  Outsiders often imagine
  <a href="#Anauroch" data-content-chunk-id="b8505bd1-527d-4a94-9e65-d68d991854f8">Anauroch</a> to
  be a featureless expanse of desolate sand, but in fact it is defined by a glacier in the north and
  a central rocky plateau, both surrounded by the wind-blown sands.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f22666c3-2c8f-4a9e-b6e8-22d7e5936dcd">
  <strong><em>At’ar’s Looking Glass.</em></strong> A hazardous, sweltering stretch of desert in
  southeastern Anauroch is At’ar’s Looking Glass, named for the merciless Bedine sun god, whose face
  is reflected by the sand back up and into the heavens.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="71f2dbe5-1399-47c3-b544-ba25c9c06485">
  <strong><em>High Ice.</em></strong> The desolate glacier called the High Ice crowns the northern
  reaches of Anauroch. Few people live here. Arctic monsters abound on the High Ice’s frosty plains,
  including different kinds of dragons. In spite of the danger, expeditions strike out into the
  glacier hoping to plunder ancient cities that have been buried in and preserved by ice.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="011fc496-7806-4b18-8ffc-7e3f27b15684">
  <strong><em>Plain of Standing Stones.</em></strong> The central region of Anauroch is the Plain of
  Standing Stones, a plateau that overlooks the sandy desert to the south. This area is mostly
  waterless, covered in gravel and jagged rock and ravaged by constant, howling winds. This is where
  the Shadovar first discovered chardalyn—a dark, icelike crystal that absorbs magic.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7540c056-634f-4234-a6b3-415e12abc78a">
  <strong><em>Saiyaddar.</em></strong> One place in southern Anauroch teems with lush greenery and
  abundant animal life: the Saiyaddar. This verdant valley within the Sword is lined with natural
  springs that keep it watered, and the Bedine people guard the area as a hunting ground and safe
  waypoint for travelers. None of the individual Bedine tribes lay claim to Saiyaddar, and they work
  together fiercely to ensure that no one else tries.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97ed7844-3adf-4b1d-af1e-09fc922f56bc">
  <strong><em>Scimitar Spires.</em></strong> The Scimitar Spires is a range of sharp mountain peaks
  that abut the Shoal of Thirst and the lush Saiyaddar valley. Nestled in the northern reach of the
  Spires is Elah’zad, an oasis sacred to the god Eldath. A temple at the oasis is made of
  translucent desert rock; it’s said Eldath can speak through anyone who enters the temple.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d2862883-5440-4b7e-b1b1-70e9cbde53be">
  <strong><em>Shoal of Thirst.</em></strong> Shadovar magic once created and preserved a body of
  water here called the Shadow Sea. With Thultanthar’s destruction and the fall of the empire, the
  magical cloud cover that protected the sea blew away, and the desert swiftly reclaimed the land.
  Legends speak of valuable gems once buried beneath the sea that now lie exposed to treasure
  hunters, but the Shoal’s proximity to Shade makes excavation of those gems a dangerous task.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8378c09d-b4d1-4d63-b509-cc767cefc873">
  <strong><em>The Sword.</em></strong> When most people think of Anauroch, they think of the
  southern region known as the Sword, named for the bandits and raiders who maraud the region.
  Vicious creatures such as wyverns and purple worms are abundant.

  <a href="#Anauroch" data-content-chunk-id="33e10287-2724-4035-87b0-2a6cc7b64e30">Anauroch</a> is
  littered with ancient ruins, particularly those of fallen Netherese cities. For those willing to
  sift through the expanses of weathered stones and sand, the desert holds many secrets buried in
  time, many of which are powerful, valuable, or both.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6bf004b0-cd3e-4410-bd34-a7f2cfc3eff4">
  <strong><em>Araugul.</em></strong> The southern region of Anauroch was once home to a large,
  expansionist goblinoid realm known as Hlundadim. The fortress-city of Araugul, also known as
  Goblinmount, was its capital and the home of the mysterious wizard Hlundadim, founder and leader
  of the realm. As weather in Anauroch grew arid and the land turned to dust, the goblins fled and
  the wizard vanished as mysteriously as he appeared. That was over a thousand years ago. Goblinoids
  and their allies have since returned to the ruins, and some live there still, defending the city
  from intruders.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91ebdbe6-dc1d-4531-a310-3168464b7039">
  <strong><em>Ascore.</em></strong> The ruined northern city of Ascore was once a bustling port on
  the shore of a now-dried sea. Now its windswept streets are haunted by undead, and the ancient
  blue dragon Iymrith has claimed the ruins as part of her territory. Somewhere in its depths,
  Ascore holds a portal into the lost Netherese city of Hlaungadath. The portal is activated by
  reading the final line of a carving in a stone archway.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ef0cc5d-c665-4b13-ada7-db688f795209">
  <strong><em>Azirrhat.</em></strong> A small cluster of peaks on the southeast edge of the Plain of
  Standing Stones is known as Azirrhat, a word meaning “slashed rocks.” The crags are dotted with
  veins of gold, and prospectors sometimes brave encounters with the asabi, a territorial, nocturnal
  group of lizardfolk that dwell in the peaks.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d818d42-8027-4446-b0c6-5dccd326ea91">
  <strong><em>Heroes’ Helm.</em></strong> The rocky pinnacle of Heroes’ Helm in central Anauroch
  rises four hundred feet and is shaped like the helmet of a mighty warrior, complete with two caves
  where the warrior’s eyes would be. The caves lead to an expansive central cavern, home to an
  ancient blue dragon named Ghondalaath.

  <strong><em>Hlaungadath.</em></strong> One of the ruined flying cities of Netheril in Anauroch,
  Hlaungadath landed near the High Ice and was abandoned. In the ages since, it has been claimed by
  a powerful family of lamias. The city is still largely intact, maintained by the lamias and their
  thralls. The lamias kill most intruders, but they occasionally pick a few to ensnare with their
  curses and enchantments, keeping them as pets and servants. Most peoples of Anauroch know the
  place’s reputation and stay well away, but lost knowledge and potential wealth are powerful lures
  for adventurers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="19c62ece-5570-4f41-829e-90aeebf86141">
  <strong><em>Lashloc.</em></strong> The so-called Lake of Ice is the result of subterranean hot
  springs that melt a sliver of the High Ice into a long, twisting lake. For creatures that live on
  the High Ice, Lashloc is an oasis—a place to stay warm and find liquid water without needing a
  fire. High winds freeze some of the lake’s surface water into ice floes. Predatory creatures lair
  within the lake, but three insidious aboleths dominate, using the lake’s unusual nature to draw in
  victims.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d40f46f-b7cb-4f01-ac07-48ae9d661bae">
  <strong><em>Mines of Tethyamar.</em></strong> On the edge of Anauroch, southeast of Addas Babar,
  once lay the dwarven realm of Tethyamar. This vast city branched out underground as scattered and
  self-reliant neighborhoods that contributed to a large and thriving whole. Four centuries ago,
  Tethyamar was conquered by evil wizards commanding fiends and mercenaries. Repeated attempts to
  reclaim the city ended in failure. The survivors fled to Daggerdale in the

  had a long trade rivalry with Tethyamar when the city was lost, and Zhents have plundered the
  upper levels of the lost city for magical secrets and treasure.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fd0fb90-4b59-4bcb-9a2f-a949624aa515">
  <strong><em>The Shattered Tower.</em></strong> Long ago, phaerimm magic brought down the cloud
  castle of a storm giant, which crashed in eastern Anauroch. Adventurers have found the skeletal
  remains of storm giants and looted many of its halls. The castle is vast and inhabited by
  elementals and a blue dragon that either survived the crash or moved in after.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2f46f908-83da-486d-ba0a-a3c5ae5201bf">
  <strong><em>The Smokeholes.</em></strong> Travelers in the High Ice see huge gouts of smoke and
  steam rising from the Smokeholes from many miles away. These vents were created by a massive
  network of underground lava tubes and lakes known as the Caverns of Burning Ice, inhabited by
  salamanders and dragons that would otherwise find the High Ice inhospitable, including blue,
  brass, and red dragons. The heat from the lava creates vents in the ice above and carves out
  steamy grottoes that capture warm, wet air.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4451be48-9b40-417e-8dbb-880cf6d680e3">
  <strong><em>Untrivvin.</em></strong> Yetis dwell on the slopes of a mountain in the High Ice
  called Untrivvin, but the mountain’s interior is a catacomb of meticulously crafted tunnels and
  halls that echo and amplify any sound made within them. This is the source of the mountain’s name,
  which means “singing rock.” The honeycomb of passages within the mountain suggest that they were
  carved, perhaps by an ancient civilization predating even those of the giants and dragons.

  Life in Anauroch
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1534a9a6-0a78-45da-a70d-466c253b3b22">
  Simply surviving in
  <a href="#Anauroch" data-content-chunk-id="ed86a600-1184-40f6-b280-553c39d2eb67">Anauroch</a> is a
  challenge. The people that dwell here rely on traditions based on generations of experience.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a8ac53c1-3140-407a-aec2-884c78266258">
  <strong><em>Banditry.</em></strong> Brigands, raiders, and other bandits are an unfortunate
  constant in Anauroch. Victims of these bandits face a choice: fight to defend their property, or
  allow raiders to take what they please in the hope that enough is left behind for life to
  continue.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccf27080-6065-41ed-aad9-5db03462074e">
  <strong><em>Dry Death.</em></strong> Finding water is a struggle for anything that lives in this
  region. Most places are bone dry sand and dusty stone. The High Ice is a frozen glacier with no
  fuel for fire in sight.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c167c3f7-43aa-4837-9008-f1bf21319bda">
  <strong><em>Gods and Names.</em></strong> Deities worshiped in Anauroch are often gods of the
  Faerûnian pantheon who go by other faces and names. At’ar, for example, is a pitiless sun god, but
  scholars of other lands consider her a form of Amaunator. Eldath, a god of peaceful waters,
  tenaciously maintains a presence in this harsh land, much like the springs and oases that offer
  life among the dust.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ae1c5fc-dca3-4a81-a5c4-2ed38aa0c34c">
  <strong><em>Travels and Trade.</em></strong> For many in Anauroch, life is spent on the move, as
  staying still often means death. Bedine tribes bring their food and livelihood with them,
  escorting herds between oases. Others, like the

  Red Wizards.

<p data-content-chunk-id="22e79c60-203d-475b-96bc-eea5ed2c8798">
  Aglarond, Rashemen, and Thay—collectively known as the Arcane Empires—are ruled by spellcasters.
  Although all kinds of arcane magic are practiced in these lands, each realm has its own preferred
  magical tradition. In Aglarond, where the legendary Simbul once ruled, sorcery reigns supreme. In
  Rashemen, warlocks called hathrans forge pacts with mighty spirits known as telthors. And, in
  Thay, the word of a Red Wizard is law. All the Arcane Empires maintain large fighting forces
  augmented by spellcasting leaders. The common folk of these lands, though, aren’t spellcasters;
  magical training is a sign of status and power.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c34f5ee2-a42d-4ff3-af98-57e99153966d">
  Adventures here spotlight the struggle against supernatural foes, with both heroes and villains
  wielding dazzling arcane magic. Sometimes this struggle takes place on the battlefield between
  armies. But often characters wage war in the shadows, infiltrating Thayan strongholds or sniffing
  out Red Wizard agents.

  Aglarond
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd8e5d7b-e59b-42a5-a6c5-30b9a8671ea3">
  The realm of Aglarond was founded five centuries ago, bringing together human settlers and elves
  of the Yuirwood in a treaty of mutual defense and friendship. For centuries, the
  <a
    href="/sources/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards"

  >
  of <a href="#Thay" data-content-chunk-id="78ed9aef-9333-473f-8ba8-615a4dfaaf20">Thay</a> have
  posed a constant threat, leaving Aglarondans distrusting of arcane magic. This changed under the
  leadership of the Simbul, a sorcerer of legendary power whose goodness—while capricious—was beyond
  question. Under the Simbul’s leadership, individuals born with arcane magic were trained as
  sorcerers, and this tradition has continued after her death. Now the realm is ruled by the
  Simbarch Council, most of whom are arcane spellcasters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0525f704-6a61-4d5b-95b3-5fe0dfd37394">
  Aglarond is famous as a place where elves and humans have come together to form a single realm.
  Marriage between elves and humans is common there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec956f2e-ae8d-4c5b-be1a-d757bdfc0f78">
  <strong><em>Altumbel.</em></strong> The small human kingdom called Altumbel is often considered
  part of Aglarond, but its inhabitants assert its independence and distinct identity. People here
  make their living from the sea, and the capital, Spandeliyon, is called the City of Pirates.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1afedb1-760f-4381-9000-5e4c890413a3">
  <strong><em>Fang Light.</em></strong> The small peninsula that juts north of Velprintalar is known
  as South Fang. (Cape Dragonfang in
  <a href="#Thesk" data-content-chunk-id="baea5ff7-06ef-4369-b47c-6ff85f5ce036">Thesk</a>, on the
  north side of the Sea of Dlurg, is called North Fang in Aglarond.) It’s an isolated and parochial
  backwater whose inhabitants are derisively known as “Fangers” by other residents of the
  <a href="#ArcaneEmpires" data-content-chunk-id="8a331a06-9f8a-4394-a3b8-4dcd122cfe85"
    >Arcane Empires</a
  >. At the tip of South Fang stands Fang Light, a magical lighthouse maintained by a mage that
  guides ships in and out of the Sea of Dlurg. Pirates frequently target the lighthouse.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32051610-ec8a-4fec-9faa-3d893ba730d6">
  <strong><em>Sunglade.</em></strong> Just inside the southern edge of the Yuirwood stands the
  Sunglade, a double circle of standing stones decorated with elven runes. This ancient site was
  constructed by and sacred to inhabitants of the Yuirwood who left or died out long ago. The outer
  ring of larger stones bears dedications to deities of the elven pantheon, the Seldarine, while the
  inner stones represent the deities of long-gone human inhabitants of the Yuirwood. Though
  apparently abandoned, the stones remain in excellent repair, and a mystic presence lingers in the
  sunny glade, waiting for someone to speak to it.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04f17418-76e2-4ada-916e-cd07f2bff52a">
  <strong><em>Umber Marshes.</em></strong> Named for the rusty water created by its iron deposits,
  the Umber Marshes is the border between Aglarond and
  <a href="#Thay" data-content-chunk-id="971f099e-4540-425d-a6c1-fec8b70f5276">Thay</a>. Countless
  raids and invasions have criss-crossed this swamp, which is famous for intolerable bloodsucking
  insects and deadly monsters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6ec2259c-92dc-4bd3-89d9-0f8081fbfa82">
  <strong><em>Velprintalar.</em></strong> The crown jewel of the Aglarond peninsula is Velprintalar,
  one of the most beautiful cities in Faerûn. The Simbarch Council, made up of sorcerers and other
  spellcasters, rules Aglarond from a magnificent palace of pale-green Mulhorandi stone. Sorcerers
  from across Faerûn come here for training.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85ce8406-1006-400b-af1a-5cf4352a5f5f">
  <strong><em>Watchwall.</em></strong> Between the fortress city of Glarondar and the slopes of the
  mountain Umbergoth stretches the fifteen-mile-long stone Watchwall built long ago by galeb duhr
  for the Aglarondan crown. The Watchers—guards assigned to the wall—keep a constant lookout for
  Thayan aggression.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0006286-05e0-4a7b-905d-3a5f40cd92a8">
  <strong><em>Wizards’ Reach.</em></strong> The cities along Aglarond’s south coast are nominally
  ruled by Aglarond, but in practice the farther east one goes, the more the Red Wizards hold sway.
  Cross-country travel through the coastal marshes is difficult. Monsters leave the eaves of the
  Yuirwood and roam the coast of the Wizards’ Reach.

  <strong><em>Yuirwood.</em></strong> Elves who settled this forest millennia ago were called Yuir.
  Over centuries, humans joined them and adopted elven traditions, living among ancient Yuir ruins.
  These woods are protected by powerful magic that blocks scrying and detection spells. Fey
  crossings are plentiful, and many dangerous animals call the forest home.

  An infamously insular realm of deep forests, high mountains, and wind-blasted heaths, Rashemen is
  home to magical practices considered strange by outsiders but also respected as frightfully
  potent. The warriors of Rashemen are berserkers known for their fierce frenzy in battle. The ruler
  of the realm, titled the Iron Lord, is chosen from among the berserkers by a council of
  mask-wearing spellcasters called hathrans. The hathrans are leaders in many aspects of Rashemen’s
  society, drawing their magic from pacts with powerful spirits that dwell in the realm’s magical
  woodlands. The current Iron Lord is Mangan Uruk, who has held the position for a generation.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ae77360-0f63-43ae-9410-f861f2d09f50">
  The people of Rashemen revere a trio of gods they call the Three: Bhalla (the Den Mother),
  Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and the Hidden One. In addition to these gods, countless potent and
  dangerous spirits called telthor live in the forests and wild spaces of Rashemen. These gods and
  spirits make pacts with spellcasters, who don individualized masks representing their pacts. These
  spellcasters are called wychlaran (“wise ones”), in recognition of the wisdom bestowed on them in
  their pacts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09893dfc-8827-4f82-8040-bb994a2365b5">
  Traditionally, wychlaran women are called hathrans (“wise sisters”) and form a governing council
  that selects the Iron Lord, while wychlaran men are called vremyonni (“old ones”) and support the
  hathrans by crafting magic items and inventing new spells. These roles have relaxed as Rashemen
  has opened more to the outside world, and wychlaran outside of Rashemen aren’t bound to these
  roles.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="715c52d9-4982-46c3-a8ae-ea66bdd9e7f9">
  <strong><em>Ashenwood.</em></strong> By order of the hathrans, no one is permitted to live in this
  ancient forest, which is home to mighty spirits, intelligent animals, and fierce monsters. Rashemi
  enter Ashenwood to commune with or hunt these creatures, placating the spirits with gifts and
  offerings of food.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f9495d26-1674-4972-86a3-385181785e29">
  <strong><em>Citadel Rashemar.</em></strong> Once a mighty fortress, Citadel Rashemar was flattened
  over a century ago by invaders from the east who slaughtered the entire garrison of two thousand
  warriors. Now a coven of hags controls the ruins, served by a small army of goblins, giant
  animals, ogres, and other monsters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b241feb3-1d44-4081-aad6-22461809a4c1">
  <strong><em>High Country.</em></strong> The north end of the Sunrise Mountains is called the High
  Country. This perilous region is marked by wild magic, strange occurrences, and crumbling
  monoliths built by the ancient empire of Raumathar. These monoliths imprison demons summoned and
  once controlled by
  <a href="#Narfell" data-content-chunk-id="38feff39-8cad-463e-bedd-e33e1b7ac18e">Narfell</a>; now
  hathrans check them every year to ensure the wards don’t fail. An ancient white dragon,
  Kissethkashan, commands these mountains, but the site of his lair is unknown.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ee4a54e-c9dd-4ce4-8a84-c48f12a168aa">
  <strong><em>Immilmar.</em></strong> Traders, diplomats, and tourists coming to Rashemen often
  first arrive in Immilmar, Rashemen’s capital. The Iron Lord, the nominal leader of the nation,
  rules from a mighty castle raised centuries ago by hathran magic and warded with spells. Beyond
  the castle, citizens dwell in A-frame timber lodges. The city is insular, and visitors are
  encouraged to leave as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="334fe5d0-a1fd-4fad-b7df-a49c6907b326">
  <strong><em>Mines of Tethkel.</em></strong> The Rashemi folk who live and work in this iron mine
  are infamously fractious, violent, and unruly. Goblin bandits and worgs prowl the outskirts of the
  town looking for prey, while kobolds lair in the mines. The kobolds have spent decades building a
  lair fit for a dragon, and an egg in their hoard has recently hatched into a deep dragon wyrmling.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26be5e0d-736b-4c6e-839b-2c9202b43e9a">
  <strong><em>North Country.</em></strong> The North Country is the land between the Falls of Erech
  and the Towers of Smoke. While officially part of Rashemen, this land is sparsely populated and
  scattered with ruined settlements from the ancient realms of
  <a href="#Narfell" data-content-chunk-id="71bac46c-11f8-46ee-8e9e-b1ff5942b1c2">Narfell</a> and
  Raumathar. Rashemi warriors venture into the North Country and plunder these ruins to prove their
  valor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="928296f8-4ede-4f20-b87c-cea1fad5be33">
  <strong><em>Ring of Gray Flames.</em></strong> Five ancient towers built by the Raumathari
  civilization stand in a circle known as the Ring of Gray Flames. Most are ruined, but two are
  intact, and mechanical sounds and grinding noises come from within. From atop all five, gray
  flames spout. Divine magic doesn’t work within or near the towers, and the region is prowled by
  strange guardians—arcane spells brought to life.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0fe55f3-36c6-4d94-a7b8-ef17c17f65b9">
  <strong><em>Shevel.</em></strong> Tradespeople established the town of Shevel near the Golden Road
  trade route to craft and peddle their wares. Over time, the town grew into a thriving, walled city
  of immigrants within the otherwise-isolated realm of Rashemen. Since the fall of Citadel Rashemar,
  raids from the lands to the east have been a regular occurrence, and there’s always mercenary work
  to be found in Shevel.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b414db3-4855-4d26-89a1-93d5a84684b2">
  <strong><em>Sunrise Mountains.</em></strong> Most people consider the nigh-impassible Sunrise
  Mountains the eastern edge of Faerûn. The range towers fifteen thousand feet high and is littered
  with ruined towers from the ancient realm of Raumathar and mysterious wells that date to some
  other forgotten culture. The few passes over the mountains are exceedingly dangerous, and many
  lethal creatures lair in deep caves and subterranean passages.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d6a88d3-b99e-4e99-986b-5d39fa702bb6">
  <strong><em>Urlingwood.</em></strong> The mystical heart of Rashemen, Urlingwood is a dense, wild
  forest populated by telthors and supernatural beasts. Rashemen law dictates only hathrans are
  permitted here under penalty of death.

  Thay has a reputation as a barren wasteland ruled by tyrannical wizards and populated by their
  undead minions. The truth is more complex.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26041747-db63-4977-9ce1-ef3a6e505cb5">

  are more interested in self-advancement than conquest. And while undead walk openly in Thay,
  necromancy is just one of eight schools of magic, and Thay is home to many ordinary citizens just
  trying to live out their lives. All this combines to make Thay more than the caricature known
  throughout Faerûn, even if this exaggerated reputation is built on a foundation of truth.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c15f69e7-e11e-455c-b64c-df685a423dd4">
  Thay’s infamous undead ruler, Szass Tam, rules Thay, assisted by seven other zulkirs, each a
  master of a different school of magic. Few dare to oppose Szass Tam, but the zulkirs and the
  rulers of Thay’s various tharchs have considerable leeway to do as they please, so long as they
  don’t attract Szass Tam’s attention.

  pride themselves as realms that keep Thay in check, thwarting the Red Wizards’ territorial and
  magical ambitions. Thayan rulers, called tharchions, try to invade Aglarond or Rashemen every
  decade or so, and border raids are constant.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f81bdfa4-b3ec-46cf-8f81-323b2944354c">
  <strong><em>The Citadel.</em></strong> A vast and ancient fortress that predates the Red Wizards
  of Thay, the Citadel was carved out of one of the highest mountains of Thaymount by a lizard-like
  people who left their images in statues and murals. The Citadel towers among lava, ash, and
  razor-sharp rocks and has extensive subterranean levels. For centuries, the Citadel has been
  Thay’s greatest stronghold, and Szass Tam has claimed it for his own. In the Citadel, Szass Tam is
  unassailable. In the time since he moved into the Citadel, many magical atrocities have occurred
  there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="520b7dab-34c5-4246-8a8e-9128241ba805">
  <strong><em>Delhumide.</em></strong> Thay began as a colony of the distant Mulhorandi empire, and
  Delhumide was Thay’s capital. Now the old city is a dangerous ruin inhabited by fiends, evil fey,
  and desperate folk. These threats keep the region around the ruins sparsely populated, but
  adventurers brave the ruins in search of lost Thayan treasures.

  <strong><em>Plateau of Thay and Thaymount.</em></strong> Central Thay stands on a vast, desolate
  plateau. Magic formalized by Red Wizards long ago brings rain here, which in turn allows towns,
  cities, and forests to survive. A second higher plateau rises from the first, culminating in the
  volcanic peaks of Thaymount. Only Red Wizards and their guests are allowed there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eefe50a0-46ef-4600-a782-5182d206631b">
  <strong><em>Tax Stations.</em></strong> Small fortresses called tax stations dot Thay’s border,
  roads, and internal boundaries. Soldiers at each station check identification papers and collect
  small but frequent tolls. A typical tax station has a garrison of thirty to fifty warriors, often
  including a pack of gnolls.

  <strong><em>Tharchs.</em></strong> Thay is divided into districts called tharchs, many named after
  a prominent city in that region; every tharch is governed by a tharchion who answers to one of the
  eight zulkirs. The eleven tharchs are the Alaor (two islands that house Thay’s fleet and
  shipyards), Delhumide, Eltabbar, Gauros (everything between the Gauros River and the Sunrise

  to the north, merchant-princes and archdruids struggle for dominion over a harsh, beautiful
  wilderness and its bounteous resources. Even the land itself vies for supremacy; for every ruler
  who claims to control a realm, there lies a magical glacier, a shifting labyrinthine forest, or a
  monster-plagued mountain that proves nothing in these parts can truly be controlled.

  food is bland. But beneath its crusty exterior, the land teems with river-size veins of gold,
  caverns lined with gemstones, and buried cities. Those who can endure toiling in the frozen
  northlands could strike it rich at any moment.

  and Thesk are lands of plenty, competition is fierce. Adventurers arrive in droves to cities like

  In Damara, hardy folk from many backgrounds work together to turn rocky soil into tillable
  farmland or extract bloodstone from the mountains to the west. Currently, the usurper King Yarin
  Frostmantle sits smugly on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty while his people complain about

  than in west Damara. Here, amid the East Galena Mountains that separate the lands of Damara from
  neighboring Vaasa, the ruins of a settlement called Bloodstone mark the infamous Bloodstone Pass.
  In its 150-year history, Bloodstone served as the battleground for monsters, assassins, warlocks,
  and countless others who wished to command the gem trade. Its most recent attackers razed
  Bloodstone to the ground. Little remains of the site except for an ancient, petrified tree that,

  Mountains is the Glacier of the White Worm: a mass of ice populated by herds of titanic white
  remorhazes and—if rumors are to be believed—a “king worm” that rules over the others. Devotees of
  Ilmater from the nearby Monastery of the Yellow Rose practice their sacred remorhaz-taming rites
  here; a monk who entreats and rides a white remorhaz is said to bear the “gift of the worm” and is
  afforded great prestige. Yellow Rose sages speculate that the glacier must be magical, for it is
  too far south for a nonmagical glacier to exist. The source of this magic, however, remains
  unknown.

  <strong><em>Forest of Lethyr.</em></strong> Mysteries abound in the gloomy Forest of Lethyr. The
  druids of Lethyr brook few trespassers in their sacred groves, and they resort to violence against
  anyone who means to exploit the land’s abundant resources. Outsiders who persist in exploring
  Lethyr might discover Yeshelmaar, the center of civilization in the Great Dale and a testament to
  elven engineering. In Yeshelmaar, visitors can see architectural marvels: vast, floating herb
  gardens; tiered stone courts; and ornately carved grottoes with pools of crystalline spring water,
  to name just a few.

  The Great Glacier originally formed from the ice necklace of the deity Ulutiu. The people who call
  this vast territory home are the Ulutiuns. Few southerners have ever interacted with them. Most
  outsiders who dare tread these arctic wastes instead encounter fierce monsters adapted to the
  glacier—white dragons, remorhazes, and even ice devils. The latter are said to be servants of an
  ancient and mighty priest of Auril who styles herself “the Ice Queen.”

  In the past, Impiltur was among the wealthiest realms in Faerûn. Over the past century, though,
  the realm unsuccessfully grappled with magically altered geography and incursions from demons and
  demon worshipers. Now the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars have risen again, and Impiltur’s
  wealth and influence are returning. Hopeful commoners whisper that a lost monarch of the old
  ruling family will rise up to restore Impiltur to the great empire it once was.

  <strong><em>Lyrabar.</em></strong> The capital city of Impiltur, Lyrabar, boasts numerous sailing
  academies. The academies are fierce rivals and host regattas and other contests of skill
  year-round. One of the academies, Waywater’s Nautical University, specializes in teaching
  abjuration magic to seafaring mages. Lyrabar hosts the headquarters of the Warswords,
  chainmail-clad soldiers responsible for patrolling Impiltur’s trade roads and keeping merchants
  safe from brigands and monsters. Warswords sometimes deputize adventurers as
  “swordpoints”—temporary agents of t he law granted special privileges within Impiltur’s borders.

  The ruins of two ancient empires—Narfell, home to demon worshipers, and Raumathar, known for its
  battle mages—dot the plains where nomadic horse riders now roam, offering abundant opportunities
  for brave deeds and exploration. The Nars don’t care about dynasties or family lines. Rather, they
  believe actions speak for themselves. This sensible attitude also explains most riders’ preference
  to avoid the demon-cursed ruins of ancient Narfell. However, some now dwelling on the plains wish
  to reclaim ancient Narfell’s powerful, sinister magic for a new generation of Nar demonologists.

  <strong><em>Bildoobaris.</em></strong> In a vast, empty plain beneath the shadow of Mount Nar,
  tens of thousands of nomads gather for one tenday every summer for an annual trade meet, forming a
  vast tent city called Bildoobaris. Here, Nars barter in horses, furs, and jewelry; share news and
  oral histories; and celebrate the realm’s all-too-brief time of plenty. In recent years, Nar
  demonologists have come to Bildoobaris bearing demonic relics and weapons from the buried cities
  of ancient Narfell in the hope of recruiting more followers.

  Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East because it is the western terminus of the Golden
  Way, an ancient trade road that connected Faerûn to lands beyond the Sunrise Mountains. Although
  much of the Golden Way now lies in ruins, remnants of the old road still appear in the
  well-traveled hills between Thesk’s largest cities—Telflamm, Phsant, and Tammar. Thesk’s glory
  days as a trade metropolis are over, and Theskian wealth is now concentrated in the uppermost
  echelons of society, whose oligarchs exploit the working class via all manner of harebrained
  investment schemes.

  <strong><em>Golden Way.</em></strong> Despite its history as the most famous trade route between
  Faerûn and lands to the east, the Golden Way is now a shadow of its former self. In Faerûn, the
  Golden Way begins at the western edge of Thesk, where well-maintained roads connect the cities of
  Telflamm, Phent, Phsant, and Tammar. Beyond Thesk’s borders, the Golden Way becomes a path through
  the plains of Ashanath, connects to
  <a href="#Rashemen" data-content-chunk-id="f9e884a0-283b-49e4-a32e-0d091bc1ca4a">Rashemen</a> via
  various ferries, and dissolves into little more than piles of stones—way markers—as it wraps
  around the Sunrise Mountains and continues eastward through the Hordelands and beyond.
  Interspersed here and there along the road are encampments and travel stations that provide
  shelter for those daring to make the months-long intercontinental journey.

  <strong><em>Telflamm.</em></strong> The largest city in Thesk isn’t controlled by that realm, but
  by the Shadowmasters, a religious thieves’ guild that owns the city’s inns and gambling halls and
  exercises considerable influence over Thesk’s government. The Shadowmasters operate out of the
  House of the Master’s Shadow, the largest temple to Mask in Faerûn.

<p data-content-chunk-id="9b4576b5-1e8d-4f28-b9f2-eb556677a5e9">
  The Vast isn’t a unified realm, but a common term for the great swath of land bound by the Dragon

  the east, and the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south. The region’s name comes from Vastar, the orc
  kingdom that once ruled this place and warred with the surrounding dwarven and elven communities.
  The Vast of today is primarily peaceful farmland ringed by prosperous coastal cities. Countless
  treasures lie buried just beneath the land’s surface, either in dwarven ruins, orc crypts, or
  forgotten battlegrounds.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="817b590c-a52d-4eb3-b409-e5ac3728925a">
  As in other lands that touch the Earthspur Mountains, the gem trade is strong in the Vast, and
  many miners and adventurers alike come to the foothills seeking their fortune. The wisest are
  wary, for many of the tunnels that ribbon the Earthspurs connect to the Underdark, whose
  communities are far less welcoming of outsiders.

  <strong><em>Procampur.</em></strong> One of the oldest extant settlements along the Sea of Fallen
  Stars, Procampur was built atop an underground dwarven town called Proeskampalar. Procampur is
  known for its walled city districts, with slate-roofed buildings. More than its handsome
  architecture, though, Procampur is reputedly the single richest independent city along the
  northern Inner Sea. Hundreds of gem cutters and goldsmiths call the place home, and it would be a
  popular target for pirates if not for its incomparable fortifications and vigilant local
  government.

  Life in the Forgotten Lands
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="94201a7e-1a30-46f7-aef8-7b21e816c590">
  Savage winters, perilous wilds, and fierce rivals mean that only the hardy survive long in the
  <a href="#ForgottenLands" data-content-chunk-id="b8d5cf32-2dda-48d1-8a51-5696ba32015c"
    >Forgotten Lands</a

  region’s reputation as a land of grim settlers and cutthroat traders.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47c63b2f-0366-4236-9ada-ff83e3cc855d">
  <strong><em>Adventurers’ Hub.</em></strong> The Forgotten Lands are a popular destination for
  adventurers from all over Faerûn. These realms are rich with history and magic that can turn a
  peasant into a monarch. Not all who journey to this region yearn for fame, however; many come to
  remote realms like
  <a href="#Damara" data-content-chunk-id="0b5f717f-9c49-40e9-917c-988f28a2132c">Damara</a> to
  forget their old lives and forge new destinies. And the Forgotten Lands are filled with material
  wealth; those who seek fortune here can dredge it up from the seafloor, carve it out of a
  mountain, or retrieve it from a dungeon.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32889ba2-15c3-4e59-8735-bb8113e3aa80">
  <strong><em>Bloodstone Economy.</em></strong> Realms in this corner of Faerûn benefit from
  abundant resources in nearby mountain ranges. The East Galenas, Earthspurs, and Earthfasts are
  rich in rare metals and gemstones, especially chalcedony, known locally as bloodstone. This gem is
  so plentiful—and so vital to the local economy—that these areas are sometimes referred to as the
  Bloodstone Lands.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc021f8e-9da6-4699-b38b-a283cf457963">
  <strong><em>Brutal Climes.</em></strong> Life is hard in most of the Forgotten Lands. Long, icy
  winters and fleeting, muddy summers make for difficult farming. Many find other ways to
  subsist—such as trapping, mining, or fishing—but these trades are only slightly less trying in the
  region’s frigid climate. Fussy nobles and soft urbanites don’t last long in these parts; the
  average denizen of the Forgotten Lands is one of the toughest, most down-to-earth people one will
  ever meet.

<p data-content-chunk-id="85252ace-7aff-43fb-b6ae-652493c39948">
  <strong><em>Living with the Elements.</em></strong> Regional natives must cope with the

  <a href="#Narfell" data-content-chunk-id="4222885b-9373-4600-9589-54e9402cf172">Narfell</a>, for
  example, migrate south during the dark months, avoiding the brunt of winter’s chill. Elsewhere,
  such as the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in Damara, people overcome the elements by mastering
  magic and enlisting the aid of local fauna. (See “Glacier of the White Worm” above.)

<p data-content-chunk-id="5078b811-a4e8-460e-9e66-ad2a83db5546">
  <strong><em>Trade Prevails.</em></strong> For all their talk of autonomy and self-determination,
  the people of the Forgotten Lands also understand the importance of sharing goods and information.
  Trade in these realms begins in the mountains of Damara and plains of Narfell, from where it flows
  toward the Sea of Fallen Stars as a rushing river that empties into the rich ports of
  <a href="#Impiltur" data-content-chunk-id="1768b611-ed74-48f9-870d-46d97796e938">Impiltur</a> and

  and the Sword Coast, folk here hold onto their wealth instead of flaunting it in the form of
  lavish palaces or gilded statues.

  Laissez-faire Featherdale, ambitious Scardale, and Harrowdale—the oldest dale—lie to the east.

  <strong><em>Dales Compact.</em></strong> When human settlers first arrived in the area now known
  as the Dalelands, the forest of Cormanthor was already occupied by a thriving elven civilization.
  These wary elves proposed the Dales Compact: an agreement that allowed humans to settle on the
  edges of Cormanthor or in places that the great trees didn’t grow, so long as they didn’t cut
  deeper into the forest. Human mages erected a stone obelisk called the Standing Stone in
  Cormanthor as a symbol of unity between the two species. This date became the beginning of the
  Dalereckoning, or 1 DR, marking the first year of the modern Faerûnian calendar. Though
  Cormanthor’s elven civilization fell long ago and few elves still live there, the people of the
  Dalelands still respect the Dales Compact.

  <strong><em>Archenbridge.</em></strong> A history of Sembian invasions has led the trading hub of
  Archenbridge (the chief settlement of Archendale) to become the most fortified town in the
  Dalelands. Most goods from

  <strong><em>Cormanthor.</em></strong> Cormanthor is a forest of towering trees. Most of the elves
  who once lived here left long ago, but some refugees of Myth Drannor’s second fall remain. A swath
  of fungi, oozes, and rot called Moander’s Road was carved through Cormanthor’s northern reaches by
  the rampaging god of corruption and rot, Moander.

  <strong><em>Myth Drannor.</em></strong> The elven metropolis of Myth Drannor fell hundreds of
  years ago to demonic forces. Elves briefly reclaimed it in the last century, but then the flying
  Shadovar city of Thultanthar crashed into it, doing extensive damage. Now demons and other
  monsters again infest Myth Drannor’s remains. Its many ruins invite adventurers to seek the lost
  city’s treasures or find a way to restore its mythal.

  <strong><em>Shadowdale Town.</em></strong> Though small and unassuming at first glance, many
  consider sleepy Shadowdale Town the Dalelands’ cultural heart. It was once home to Elminster and
  Storm Silverhand, though neither has been seen in town for years. These days, a growing community
  of orcs from the River Ashaba have settled in Shadowdale. Lady Khara Sulwood rules from the
  twisted Tower of Ashaba, with the help of the elf warrior Tharinel, her reliable bodyguard and

  Named after its central body of water, the Moonsea is a region of disparate cities ruled by cruel
  despots. It is a land of people hardened long ago by the assaults and schemes of chromatic
  dragons. The people of the Moonsea view the rest of Faerûn and even other Moonsea cities with
  distrust. In turn, people elsewhere in Faerûn view these folk as unfriendly and dangerous.

  <strong><em>Hillsfar.</em></strong> The independent walled city of Hillsfar, on the southern shore
  of the Moonsea, is busy, prosperous, and secured by a mercenary company called the Red Plumes.
  Until recently, Hillsfar’s Great Law of Humanity barred non-humans from entering the city. After a
  revolution deposed First Lord Torin Nomerthal, his successor, Vuhm Yestral, revoked the law.
  Hillsfar still suffers from strained relations between humans and other species, and progress is
  slower than Vuhm would like. In the wake of Zhentil Keep’s decline, Hillsfar’s only rival for
  dominance of the Moonsea is the city of Mulmaster.

  <strong><em>The Moonsea.</em></strong> Rumors persist of isles that rise from the cold, purplish
  depths of the eponymous Moonsea on certain nights of the year. An underwater tower called the Bell

  Eventually the Zhents returned and rebuilt it. Zhentil Keep is again a flourishing trade city, but

  The young realm of Sembia aggressively pursues both trade and territorial expansion. Merchant
  councils govern many of its cities, from gothic Saerloon to lavish Selgaunt. Sembians relish the

  trade relationship with neighboring Sembian cities before being peacefully annexed into Sembia. It
  was renamed Ordulin and now serves as Sembia’s capital. Every seven years, the merchant councils
  of Sembia’s other cities convene and appoint an Overmaster from their ranks to govern Sembia from
  Ordulin. They have gone to great lengths to foster Sembian pride in the city and erase its
  cultural roots as a former dale.

  anonymous Council of Five, said to consist of the heads of Amn’s most influential merchant
  families. Open worship of Cyric is legal here, thanks to deep ties between the Church of Cyric and
  the council, and Amn has long had imperial ambitions. Spellcasting, on the other hand, is
  forbidden. The law permits only priests of Cyric and the Cowled Wizards— specialized mages in

  centuries, home to benevolent lycanthropes as well as elves and other folk. Protected by a
  powerful mythal, it nevertheless fell to internal dissent many centuries ago. As evil wizards and
  their undead and elemental minions conquered the city, Selûne removed Myth Lharast from the world,
  placing it in a demiplane. Now the city can be accessed only when the moon is full.

  Tradition and innovation coexist in Calimshan under the reign of Sultana Songal. Calimshan’s
  people have a fraught and complex relationship with the realm’s four genie factions. The genies
  have both subjugated and fought alongside the people of Calimshan at various points in the realm’s
  ten-thousand-year history. While Calishites of the desert and other wilderness areas rely on genie
  magic for survival, inhabitants of Calimport have instead embraced and improved on innovations

  the flying djinni city of Burin Bir and its trailing palaces drift above the Forest of Mir; and
  the efreeti fortress of Gozva Ka stands in the Calim Desert, hidden with shimmering illusions.
  These palaces are ruled by noble genies and are also home to a variety of aides and servitors who

  appeals to the divine patronage of Siamorphe, a demigod of nobility, to assert its right to rule.
  When Queen Anais Rhindaun died of old age, her half-niece and adopted daughter, Ysabel Linden,
  assumed the throne. Ysabel has guided Tethyr with a courageous heart and steady hand for three
  years, but she hasn’t received the blessing of Siamorphe. Some of Tethyr’s nobles whisper that
  Ysabel is too far removed from the Rhindaun bloodline—and Siamorphe’s favor—to rule.

  harvest hidden abundance: gems, timber, and the valuable bones of knucklehead trout. Would-be
  heroes and villains alike come to Icewind Dale seeking frost giant artifacts, Underdark wonders,
  and Netherese secrets, but most run afoul of fierce monsters, locals, and priests of Auril—to say
  nothing of chardalyn, a blighted material capable of twisting minds and spirits in pursuit of

  Self-crowned King Orrusk Homebringer is working to restore an orc domain in the far north,
  beginning with the shattered fortress of Dark Arrow Keep. The Kingdom of Many-Arrows united the
  disparate orc tribes of the Spine of the World for over a hundred years until it was razed in the
  War of the Silver Marches. Orrusk would see it come into being again, and more orcs arrive every

  The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a realm, but rather a tenuous but powerful coalition between contentious
  settlements of the North and elsewhere, established to promote peace, prosperity, and security
  among its members. It includes Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Mithral Hall, and others, including
  powerful

    >Sword Coast</a
  >” in this chapter). Each settlement in the alliance looks first to its own interests, then to the
  needs of its allies. The Alliance hires adventurers to investigate and eradicate threats to the
  region and isn’t above using violence and deception in pursuit of its goals. See chapter 6 for
  more information on the Lords’ Alliance.

<p data-content-chunk-id="30282027-e326-4c19-bd22-5ba909aa4f00">
  <strong><em>High Road.</em></strong> A vital lifeline linking settlements along the Sword Coast
  and one of the North’s foremost trade routes, the High Road begins in
  <a href="#Luskan" data-content-chunk-id="b17c7dc1-0c14-45f9-b1e2-b347c3c21bf2">Luskan</a>, runs
  south through Neverwinter, and then continues along the coast to Waterdeep (where it continues as
  the Trade Way). After decades of neglect and disrepair, the road is again safe to travel thanks to
  the efforts of Dagult Neverember and the High Road Charter Company.

  <strong><em>Mirabar.</em></strong> The richest city in the North sits on the Mirar River, enclosed
  by sloped outer walls. Above ground, a largely human population is ruled by their hereditary
  marchion, but Mirabar is deeply dwarven. Tunnels, forges, and foundries in the massive undercity
  lead to the great mines of the Sword Coast. Dwarven elders on the Council of Sparkling Stones rule
  underground, and the Axe of Mirabar, a well-armed company of dwarf soldiers, defends the city
  against threats, above or below.

<p data-content-chunk-id="13aba7a8-ba71-443e-8692-75ecc322cb90">
  <strong><em>Neverwinter.</em></strong> The City of Skilled Hands was once known for its master
  crafters, fine goods, and lavish gardens heated year-round by the Neverwinter River, flowing from
  Mount Hotenow. When the volcano erupted and a great chasm to the Underdark opened, Neverwinter was
  nearly destroyed. Now, with the volcano’s wrath spent and the chasm sealed, the city is rebuilding
  itself under the rule of Lord Dagult Neverember.

  <strong><em>Silverymoon.</em></strong> Rightly called the Gem of the North, this quiet,
  cosmopolitan city is a powerful member of the Lords’ Alliance and a haven of learning, music, and
  culture. The Knights in Silver and magical defenses protect the city’s ivy-covered walls and
  towers, where gardens and trees cast dappled light on peaceful streets. For a time, Silverymoon
  was the capital of a tight-knit alliance across the Silver Marches—the region between the
  Glimmerwood and the High Forest. The War of the Silver Marches brought an end to that alliance and
  tarnished Silverymoon’s reputation, but it is still respected and beloved across the region.

  Luskan, the City of Sails, was once a grand port, but years of crime and ill fortune have reduced
  it to a dirty dive with filthy streets, ramshackle docks, and pirates thinly disguised as traders.
  Rising above its stinking fog like a clawed hand is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of the
  Arcane Brotherhood (described in chapter 6). Five pirate lords called High Captains rule the city

  Menzoberranzan is a drow city carved from the pillars of a great cavern in the Underdark between
  Silverymoon and Mithral Hall. It is the center of Lolth’s worship in Faerûn. Also known as the
  City of Spiders, it’s known for its culture of deception, manipulation, and the capture and trade
  of enslaved surface dwellers. Although officially governed by a council of matrons from the eight
  greatest houses, the city is under the heel of House Baenre and the Matron Mother, who rules in
  Lolth’s name. On a high plateau stands the Academy, Tier Breche, where priestesses, mages, and
  noble warriors are trained. Over a hundred tunnels link the city to other parts of the Underdark,
  and drow traders sell poisons, strange mushrooms, beasts of burden, scrolls, wine, and secrets
  with merchants of the deep.

  Northern Dwarfholds
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0406d349-f1fe-4d21-8579-ba0b52ba3497">
  Throughout the North, many dwarves dwell in independent fortresses called dwarfholds. Though many
  such dwarfholds are lost, abandoned, or infested by monsters, some still stand firm. Dwarves in
  Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Gauntlgrym, Stoneshaft Hold, and Ironmaster trace
  their ancestry back to Delzoun, the ancient dwarf kingdom of the North. Mirabar and Sundabar are
  also dwarfholds, though Mirabar has welcomed human immigrants and Sundabar was razed by the
  <a href="#KingdomofManyArrows" data-content-chunk-id="151a16ea-4af8-462a-acd6-0216b8bd0664"
    >Kingdom of Many-Arrows</a
  >
  in the War of the Silver Marches. Before then, most dwarfholds had joined the Lords’ Alliance, but
  when Silverymoon failed to save Sundabar, the dwarfhold leaders declared their intention to rely
  only on one another.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f219a4d-7558-462e-8506-d8b8511a9224">
  <strong><em>Citadel Adbar.</em></strong> Citadel Adbar is a fortress in the Ice Mountains built by
  the dwarves of ancient Delzoun that has defied invaders for eighteen centuries. The War of the
  Silver Marches reduced the city’s once-great Knights of the Mithral Shield to a handful of
  members, but its defending army—the Iron Guard—remains strong.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99778648-87ad-4611-a3eb-b9d0369bd7f3">
  <strong><em>Gauntlgrym.</em></strong> Once a bastion of Delzoun, Gauntlgrym lay abandoned under
  the mountains for centuries until King Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed it from Lolth’s followers
  with an army of shield dwarves. The heart of Gauntlgrym is its legendary forge, within which is
  trapped a fire elemental known as Maegera the Dawn Titan.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a7f5f10-8ec2-4cd7-bdef-025d5938d12b">
  <strong><em>Mithral Hall.</em></strong> The ancestral home of the Battlehammer clan is a
  nigh-impregnable vault beneath the Frost Hills. Despite its almost mythic reputation, Mithral Hall
  is more of a stronghold than a city, with tunnels to other dwarfholds deep below its mines. Queen
  Dagnabbet Waybeard rules Mithral Hall, firmly in support of the Lords’ Alliance.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="578bf749-b756-4c23-821a-4c6d69abf2d5">
  <strong><em>Sundabar.</em></strong> Like its sibling-city, Mirabar, Sundabar was both an
  underground dwarfhold and a thriving surface city until it was razed by Many-Arrows orcs in the
  War of the Silver Marches. Refugees from the surface city fled west to Silverymoon and other
  nearby settlements, while the dwarves of the lower holds withdrew from the Lords’ Alliance and
  banned outsiders from the city. While the walls and buildings of the city above crumble into ruins
  stalked by roving monsters, black smoke rises from tunnels and hidden chambers, where underground
  forges still operate.

  <strong><em>High Forest.</em></strong> The greatest existing forest in Faerûn is vast and
  mysterious, a remnant from ages past, when elven realms like Illefarn and Eaerlann ruled a
  continent covered in green. The High Forest is as large as a realm, covering mountains and
  countless secrets. Here dwell treants of enormous size, stags with antlers wide as a wagon,
  gigantic bears, owlbears, wolves, centaurs, unicorns, and other creatures stranger still, some of
  which have no name remembered by mortals. The forest’s outermost fringes are inhabited by
  woodcutters and outlaws, but deeper in, wood elves and Uthgardt warriors of the Ghost Tree tribe
  guard the forest’s secrets.

  beneath this saltwater swamp, which was created many centuries ago through fell magic. The swamp
  is home to two ancient black dragons: Voaraghamanthar the Black Death and his twin brother
  Waervaerendor the Rapacious Raider. The two dragons share a psychic link and are
  indistinguishable, so they’re often mistaken for a single dragon. Efforts to drain the swamp or
  redirect the High Road away from its borders have been fruitless; the swamp merely expands to fill
  any abandoned space.

  overlords facilitated their kingdom’s ascension by subjugating tens of thousands of people from a
  distant world. The abused subjects beseeched their patron deities for freedom, and their prayers
  were answered. The Imaskar underclass liberated itself, and in place of overthrown Imaskar the
  people founded two new empires: Mulhorand and Unther.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0faee96c-18e2-4618-adc3-ca38f8a1040c">
  Though they share similar origins, Mulhorand and Unther have harbored mutual animosity toward one
  another since their founding. Their constant territorial disputes eventually birthed the
  independent realm of Chessenta to the northwest.

<p data-content-chunk-id="e11ef753-d5e8-459b-85cd-0342cd7cfb9c">
  Chessenta is an unusual empire, where a chaotic array of city-states are in perpetual conflict
  with one another. But where constant strife might weaken lesser realms, Chessenta’s endless saber
  rattling and infighting only tempers an already resilient people.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="200d5f94-d5b8-4902-a78d-616e17c71f82">
  Chessentans revel in war the way other cultures delight in sports or feasting. In Chessenta, a
  youth’s first brush with death is a rite of passage, and a life without battle is no life at all.
  Chessentans who don’t take part in their city’s bloody military campaigns toil at home to supply
  the army, growing drought-resistant crops in the thin and stony soil, forging sturdy but
  lightweight weapons and shields suitable for the hot summer wars, and producing thousands of
  barrels of the region’s famous ruby wine to keep soldiers’ spirits high.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f359587e-51e5-41f4-918f-089176bdc19b">
  [skill]Religion[/skill] is important in Chessenta, and Chessentans have an array of gods and
  demigods utterly alien to outsiders. But perhaps no deity in Chessenta is so noteworthy as
  Tchazzar, a legendary god-king who in antiquity united the city-states of Chessenta and
  spearheaded the realm’s only golden age. Tchazzar’s death four hundred years ago heralded a great
  schism between the Chessentan cities. Only recently has the violent deity returned to Faerûnian
  soil in his true form as the Great Red Dragon. After reclaiming and subjugating the city of
  Cimbar, Tchazzar now aims to reunite the fractious powers of Chessenta into his idealized warrior
  realm.

    >Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a
  >). Its theocratic rulers—the Church of Bhaelros—demand monthly sacrifices to appease their bloody
  god. The flying city uses its aerial advantage to harry its longstanding political rival, Cimbar,
  to the east. If not for Cimbar’s divine ruler, Tchazzar, Airspur likely would’ve already destroyed
  its age-old foe.

  one of the largest navies in the whole Inner Sea region. It also hosts famous non-military
  institutions such as the University, the greatest center of higher learning in the Old Empires.

  whose ruling Karanok family persecutes practitioners of arcane magic in the name of Entropy, a

  <strong><em>Threskel.</em></strong> South of the dormant volcano known as Mount Thulbane and north
  of the Riders to the Sky lies the sparsely populated land of Threskel. Chessenta and Unther both
  claim Threskel, but this remote land is famously lorded over by evil dragons. The few people who
  live in Threskel eke out pitiful existences on barren farms nestled between rocky shores and
  windswept cliffs. The desperation of this land has given rise to many heroic adventurers whom the
  dragons eagerly squash.

  Mulhorand
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="880c140e-cc39-4af1-8a09-7bb94109c59c">
  Mulhorand is the oldest of the Old Empires and was literally shaped by gods. Deities from a
  distant world—gods with names like Anhur, Horus-Re, and Set—took on physical form, leading their
  people to settle in rich, densely populated metropolises and build massive stone pyramids. To this
  day, these incarnated deities continue to walk the land and directly influence the realm.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="31c5c871-6967-479f-a385-b59caab30c4b">
  While pharaohs with divine lineage ultimately rule the realm, Mulhorand is governed by a class of
  powerful theocrats: high priests, sages, and holy warriors who serve the incarnated gods. All
  Mulhorandi, from blue-blooded nobles to common street peddlers, heed their god-kings’ wishes in
  every aspect of daily life. When a merchant’s latest shipment arrives safely at port, it is thanks
  to the will of Nephthys; a new mother’s safe delivery might personally be overseen by Hathor; and
  Mulhorandi commanders pray to Anhur, General of the Gods, for victory against Untherites who
  threaten their borders.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa9a80e9-b1e8-444e-bf8b-34e019863b91">
  <strong><em>The Great Vale.</em></strong> The breadbasket of Mulhorand produces enough barley,
  lentils, and onions to feed millions of the empire’s citizens; it is also the realm’s primary
  source of papyrus. Large bronze pumps—just one of Mulhorand’s advanced technologies—move water
  from the River of Spears to irrigate the valley’s vast farms. To the east, the Dragonsword
  Mountains cast their shadows over the Great Vale; the empire’s pharaohs and greatest high priests
  are buried among the foothills of these mountains. Marking these crypts are dozens of monuments
  and elaborate tombs—ancient step pyramids and towering obelisks—collectively known as the Land of
  the Dead.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b10d233-1be3-4b8c-916d-e1e99cce9082">
  <strong><em>River of Swords.</em></strong> This long river is the current border between Mulhorand
  and <a href="#Unther" data-content-chunk-id="20915165-f34d-4fda-951a-be1221068ada">Unther</a>. A
  perennial battleground, the River of Swords sustains few settlements along its bloodstained banks.
  Most of the river’s water is too salty to drink or water crops. In the small city of Sekras there
  is a machine that pumps water from the river and filters out the salt; only a handful of priests
  of Thoth know how to operate the pump. Occupation of Sekras has traded hands so many times that
  even its few permanent residents scarcely know which empire—if any—they currently serve.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1efe77c-c18c-4531-abd8-365c9f26fc12">
  <strong><em>Skuld.</em></strong> Anyone wishing to experience Mulhorandi culture in its most
  realized form visits the metropolis of Skuld. The so-called City of Shadows has the noteworthy
  distinction of being the oldest continually inhabited city in Faerûn. Its central district is
  called the City of the Gods; here, incarnations of Mulhorand’s god-kings live in grand temples
  that overlook lush gardens that produce delicious fruit and courtyards of gilded statues.

  Though they share a common origin story,
  <a href="#Mulhorand" data-content-chunk-id="b766e2e6-5663-4d72-b6f0-81f4ca0ff677">Mulhorand</a>
  and Unther are vastly different realms. Whereas some might call Mulhorand paradise, most of Unther
  is nothing less than a hellscape. As one sage wrote, “the society of Unther is one of the most
  miserable tyrannies that the Realms have ever known.” It is a land defined by violence—an
  ever-shifting territory of fiery war camps, poisoned rivers, and salted battlefields where
  soldiers commit unspeakable atrocities in the name of their realm. Mercenaries might find their
  fortune serving in the armies of Unther, but the cost is no less than one’s own soul.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f57b350-28ed-4b64-992b-e801f9fbd603">
  The patron god-king of Unther, Gilgeam, is largely to blame for the realm’s state. Whereas the
  god-kings of Mulhorand treat their realm with benign neglect, Gilgeam is neither benign nor
  neglectful. Cruel and vindictive, he forbids the worship of any other deity. He justifies his
  violence by attributing it to fate, a force he insists even he, a god, is beholden to. It was
  Gilgeam who led Unther to its present state of corruption and chaos. There was a short era of
  relative peace without the dread god, but that time has ended, and Gilgeam now leads a new
  generation of lambs to the slaughter. Already Unther is once more a realm of violent dysfunction,
  maintained by the brute force of Gilgeam and the raw willpower of his most devoted followers, a
  class of violent hoplites, holy warriors, and warlocks called the Children of Gilgeam.

  <strong><em>Black Ash Plain.</em></strong> This wasteland of infertile soil takes its name from
  the embers and ash that perpetually rain down from the volcanoes of the nearby Smoking Mountains.
  From the blighted earth jut brutalist ruins—vestiges of Ancient Mulhorand and even earlier
  empires. The ruins magically shift across the desert of their own accord. Those who brave the
  ruins’ subterranean depths find themselves in an ever-transforming maze of basalt corridors and
  granite columns engraved with eerie glyphs that resemble no known language.

  <strong><em>Djerad Thymar.</em></strong> The fortress-city called Djerad Thymar was the capital of
  Tymanchebar, an empire of dragonborn that was transported from its home world of Abeir to Toril
  during the Spellplague and fused with Unther to form the new realm of Tymanther. With Unther’s
  return in the Second Sundering, the armies of Unther have shattered the power of Tymanther, but
  Djerad Thymar still stands. With its awe-inspiring stone architecture (the city is carved into the
  face of a mountain) and its vast arts districts, Djerad Thymar is a bastion for draconic culture
  and a mark of great pride for dragonborn.

<p data-content-chunk-id="d2f31712-6863-4c62-985e-f43a7439a623">
  <strong><em>Messemprar.</em></strong> The large city of Messemprar is by far the finest and most
  hospitable settlement in Unther. Not coincidentally, it is also the only city not presently under
  the thumb of Gilgeam. Instead, a coalition of anti-Gilgeam mages called the North Wizards controls
  the settlement. The North Wizards foster a brand of democracy otherwise unknown in the Old
  Empires. A prime port, Messemprar is beset on all sides by would-be conquerors: war ships from
  <a href="#Chessenta" data-content-chunk-id="65917577-e414-4992-955d-fc65663dc551">Chessenta</a>,

  and freebooting Inner Sea pirates from lands abroad. Sturdy adventurers are in constant demand to
  protect the city’s independence.

  <strong><em>Unthalass.</em></strong> Supposedly, Unthalass was once the greatest city in the
  Realms: a paradise of flowering gardens, alabaster statues, and palatial limestone manors. Anyone
  who visits the city as it is now would scarcely believe such legends. Everything here has been
  sacrificed in the name of the god-king Gilgeam’s hunger for conquest. The mud-brick streets
  overflow with filth and even blood, for Gilgeam brooks no dissent within his capital. The tyrant
  himself rules all of
  <a href="#Unther" data-content-chunk-id="c2dc8ce3-f126-4b46-8bfc-984eec3f74a3">Unther</a> from an

<p data-content-chunk-id="1acd44ad-1e8f-4f77-accc-34d7a9ae0ba6">
  Those visiting the Old Empires are often surprised by the realms’ different cultural values, their
  unique architecture and customs, and the unforgiving southern climate. For natives of the Old
  Empires, these are simply facts of life.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d179ef67-6d53-43d3-af2b-cbb970274c5f">

  and <a href="#Unther" data-content-chunk-id="7be69456-6013-4847-90fa-43095cbedba7">Unther</a> are
  unfathomably old—and they are built atop the ruins of realms even older still. Most notably,
  Mulhorand and Unther are inheritors of the Imaskar Empire. To this day, countless ruins of Imaskar
  are strewn across the region, awaiting discovery by brave adventurers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ebf13a7f-8c40-4bad-b1a5-aab19568b12c">
  <strong><em>Insular Realms.</em></strong> The people of the Old Empires care little for the
  concerns of greater Faerûn. Rulers and commoners alike consider themselves and their kingdoms far
  above the juvenile concerns of younger realms. The denizens of
  <a href="#Mulhorand" data-content-chunk-id="170ca190-0336-4274-b939-66b0ea7e43f7">Mulhorand</a>
  and
  <a href="#Unther" data-content-chunk-id="bfcff54a-e16a-40ec-a181-c1e42b75f817">Unther</a> justify
  this point of view by citing the gods and godly descendants that have shaped their empires to an
  extent virtually unknown in other parts of the Realms. (Chessentans, for their part, simply view
  other cultures as weak and cowardly.) Further, rulers in the Old Empires are too concerned with
  their own internal power struggles to consider much beyond the horizon.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f758e75-fcfb-4763-bb8c-641b9a27b9eb">
  <strong><em>Living Gods.</em></strong> Unlike most Faerûnian deities, the deities of the Old
  Empires regularly assume tangible, readily perceivable forms. This allows the god-kings of these
  realms to take an active role in their followers’ affairs. These deities deliver divine mandates
  personally and issue decrees that offer little room for doubt about the gods’ motives or
  intentions. Because of this, priests in the Old Empires tend to function more like bureaucrats or
  law enforcers than spiritual guides.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="912d0d0e-1eb0-4549-9da9-7c006067bf3e">
  <strong><em>Technology and Magic.</em></strong> The people of the Old Empires are masters of
  unusual technology and forms of magic seen nowhere else in Faerûn. Some of these secrets they
  inherited from Imaskari mages called artificers. Others are simply a result of unique Mulhorandi
  or Untherite genius. Examples include bronze water pumps and mass water purification spells that
  enable the transfer and filtration of precious water, and sail-powered sand sleds and
  easy-to-learn flotation spells allowing travelers to glide on desert winds over vast distances.

  <strong><em>Criminal Underworld.</em></strong> Baldur’s Gate has a shady underworld organization

  <strong><em>The Dead Three.</em></strong> The gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul share a common history
  linked to the city of Baldur’s Gate, where they are known as the Dead Three. All three gods began
  as mortals, claimed a share of the power of the death god Jergal, and died during the Time of
  Troubles. All three have returned, and their worshipers have made a resurgence in Baldur’s Gate
  and the surrounding area, hiding away in the shadows of society. Cultists of the Dead Three plot
  endlessly to secure the ascendancy of their deities at the expense of innocent folk. (The three
  gods are described in more detail in chapter 5.)

  The realm of Elturgard encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and Berdusk. It also
  includes much of the surrounding land, including the Fields of the Dead. Once a shining kingdom,
  Elturgard fell into disarray when its capital Elturel was dragged into the Nine Hells and back
  again. Even after the capital’s return, Elturgard struggles to pick up the pieces. Some of
  Elturgard’s outer cities have attempted to secede from the increasingly theocratic realm. Elturel
  keeps them close by threatening to withdraw the protection of the Hellriders, a cavalry force that
  keeps Elturgard’s loyal cities safe from danger.

  <strong><em>The Fall of Elturel and Its Aftermath.</em></strong> A radiant sphere called the
  Companion appeared over Elturel in 1444 DR, blazing like a second sun. Elturel’s people praised
  the god Torm for this fortuitous blessing, and Elturel expanded to become the holy nation of
  Elturgard. In truth, the Companion was summoned up by the archdevil Zariel to enact a decades-long
  grudge against the city. In 1492, it became a crackling orb of darkness, dragging Elturel and its
  inhabitants into Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee0f5065-d0b3-4b57-a985-b42dba3302cd">
  While all reasonable folk know and fear the Nine Hells, this fear is largely abstract. Very few
  have ever had to see such a place with their own eyes or feel its heat on their skin. But that’s
  precisely what the citizens of Elturel had to do, as their friends and family were slain by
  marauding devils. After brave heroes eliminated the Companion and returned Elturel to the Material
  Plane, Elturgard’s theocratic government doubled down on the mandatory worship of Torm, Tyr, and
  Ilmater—three benevolent gods collectively called the Triad.

  <strong><em>Elturel.</em></strong> Elturel’s people have become more pious after returning from
  the Nine Hells, desperate to ensure their afterlives send them to the Upper Planes. But this has
  created new problems, as the paranoid populace now distrusts and harasses tieflings, blaming them
  for the city’s fall. Fearing for their safety, Elturel’s tieflings have fled in droves for

<p data-content-chunk-id="4a940eb7-76bc-4413-8042-8f0611b2fcf5">
  Also known as the City of Splendors, the bustling city of Waterdeep is ruled by a lordly council.
  The current Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, keeps her identity known to the public. The Masked Lords
  rule alongside her anonymously, thus preventing any of them from being bribed or threatened.
  Waterdeep boasts a prodigious magical academy at Blackstaff Tower, which is run by a wizard
  holding the office of the Blackstaff—currently Vajra Safahr.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1da6f355-cf27-4a7b-9a7e-d5eab2167196">
  <strong><em>City Wards.</em></strong> Waterdeep is divided into several wards. Wards aren’t
  separated by walls or gates, and crossing between wards is easy. City wards include the Sea Ward,
  marked by the palatial fortress-estates of the city’s rich and powerful; the peacefully elegant
  North Ward; and the busy marketplaces of the Trade Ward. The Southern Ward is home to many
  immigrants, while the city’s poorest live and work in the Dock Ward. Waterdeep’s dead are entombed
  in the City of the Dead, a massive park and open air mausoleum within the city. Outside Waterdeep,
  a large collection of shelters that were once temporary housing for refugees has become a
  neighborhood of its own: the Field Ward. The Field Ward isn’t patrolled by the city guards and has
  no sanitation or other city services; it is home to Waterdeep’s most desperate citizens.

  <strong><em>Defenses.</em></strong> While Waterdeep has a militia and city guard, its most famous
  defenders are magical walking statues and the griffon cavalry. The walking statues are eight
  enormous statues that sit dormant among the city’s buildings. The Blackstaff can activate them to
  defend the city in times of dire need, animating each statue into an unstoppable stone colossus.
  The griffon cavalry is made up of well-trained riders and their griffon mounts. Each rider wears a

  <strong><em>Undermountain.</em></strong> The twenty-three-floor megadungeon of Undermountain
  stretches deep beneath the city of Waterdeep. Adventurers descend into it from a well in the
  Yawning Portal tavern to search for treasure. At the dungeon’s bottommost level lairs Halaster
  Blackcloak. Halaster’s motives are unknown and perhaps unknowable. He built this behemoth of a
  dungeon complex long before Waterdeep was founded, and he’s been stocking it with perils ever
  since. Many creatures have also found their way into Undermountain of their own accord, creating
  civilizations in its halls, including the bustling, crime-ridden city of Skullport.

  There’s a reason most sea routes in Faerûn stick close to the coast: navigating the cold, choppy
  waters of the Trackless Sea is no easy feat. If the waves themselves weren’t threats enough, the
  creatures that prowl them certainly are. Vicious pirates from the Nelanther isles delight in
  pillaging ships and slaughtering their crews. Devotees of Umberlee summon tsunamis and whirlpools

  lesser degree of technological advancement to keep Lantan’s secrets safe.

  and the mainland alike. Mintarn has always been governed by a single ruler self-styled as a
  tyrant—though these tyrants generally rule with a light hand. But even the current tyrant trembles
  before the ancient red dragon Hoondarrh, who lairs on a small volcanic island northwest of Mintarn
  and demands annual tribute from Mintarn’s people.

  As Mintarn’s wealth grew, the ancient red dragon Hoondarrh demanded increasingly exorbitant
  tributes from the island’s inhabitants. Today, Hoondarrh’s influence keeps Neverwinter and
  Waterdeep from doing any business with Mintarn. This has left the island’s ruler—Her Tyrancy
  Bloeth Embuirhan—with few ways to pay an increasingly greedy red dragon. Mintarn is poised to
  undergo a violent change of rulership as its people clamor for a new approach in dealing with
  Hoondarrh.

  Fey abound and giants lurk in the misty Moonshae Isles, an archipelago steeped in fey magic. These
  wondrous isles are home to two cultures: the rugged, seafaring Norlanders and the practical,
  hard-working Ffolk. These cultures once warred with each other but have come together under the
  ruling Kendrick dynasty. Ffolk worship the Earthmother, a divine embodiment of the Moonshae Isles.
  Springs of natural magic called moonwells are her windows into the world. Druids and rangers tend
  the moonwells and protect them from a new, insidious curse called the Rusting. This curse
  threatens to transform moonwells into pools of stinking oil and living things into rusted iron.

<p data-content-chunk-id="005598fe-6179-43f3-b8ac-4c9f7d2030c0">
  <strong><em>Rusting and the Rusted.</em></strong> A century ago,
  <a href="#Amn" data-content-chunk-id="b240e2e3-c927-4fe1-9843-0bc84711e2b1">Amn</a> invaded the
  Moonshae isle of Snowdown. Led by the vampire Erliza Darissa, Amn’s soldiers stripped the island’s
  mines bare, chopped down its forests, and polluted its ponds. Moonshavians banded together to slay
  Erliza and drive out the Amnians, but the vampire laid a curse on the Moonshaes with her dying
  words. This curse became the Rusting. Animals and plants affected by the Rusting warp into twisted
  iron before eventually crumbling to dust. Moonwells become pits of slick, black oil. People who
  dwell in an area gripped by the Rusting for too long become Rusted constructs who abhor the
  living. Some Rusted Norlanders even terrorize the Moonshae’s coasts in giant warships plated with
  rusted iron.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7bf741cf-7ee6-4d57-9ad2-ca554a8dc890">
  <strong><em>Alaron.</em></strong> The Moonshavian island of Alaron is home to a large Ffolk
  population. Caer Calidyrr—a fortress that overlooks the city of Calidyrr—houses Derid Kendrick,
  high king of the Moonshaes. Norlanders live in the northern half of the island, herding sheep and
  working mines in the Farheight range.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb19171c-a2dc-4a63-b710-ac62dcadfa75">
  <strong><em>Gwynneth.</em></strong> Gwynneth is the most magical of the Moonshae Isles and the
  center of the Earthmother’s power. As of yet, it is the only Moonshae Isle totally untouched by
  the Rusting. Its landmarks include the rebuilt castle of Caer Corwell and Myrloch Vale, a forested
  valley teeming with fey. In the north of the island, the fey kingdom of Sarifal endures, ruled by
  High Lady Ordalf.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dcf203ca-88c9-4a37-a1db-f234b195f51b">
  <strong><em>Moray.</em></strong> The Moonshavian isle of Moray is home to monsters and the Red
  Shadow: packs of werewolves who worship a violent beast-god called Kazgaroth. The Red Shadow
  regularly abducts innocents for sacrifice in violent rituals.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61f4b967-37b2-4101-ac63-1b26266dfcbd">
  <strong><em>Norland.</em></strong> When Norlanders first sailed to the Moonshaes, they landed on
  the cold island now known as Norland. It remains the seat of Norlander culture in the Moonshaes.
  Jarl Olfsvenn is loyal to High King Kendrick, but he’s torn by the fact his sister has fallen
  victim to the Rusting curse and taken on a new identity as Queen Forfallen. Overfishing in the Sea
  of Moonshae has brought the Rusting to Rogarsheim, and dockworkers show the signs of exposure to
  the curse: rust-colored marks around the eyes and a hacking cough.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="efd949d3-972a-49ca-bd31-9f04099e695b">
  <strong><em>Oman’s Isle.</em></strong> Giants and their goliath kin live in well-established
  steadings and ancient Ostorian ruins all over Oman’s Isle. Visitors can safely land at Trondheim,
  which is overseen by goliaths working for the giants.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="328a310e-9ee2-4a5e-9e7c-3741888b9379">
  <strong><em>Snowdown.</em></strong> The island of Snowdown is a blight on the Moonshaes. The
  Rusting first manifested at its only moonwell, located near the center of the island. Attempts to
  rein in environmental destruction caused by Amn have proved futile, and the island’s population
  shrinks each year.

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7fca00c7-1154-4af5-8cbb-9f9f57b782c4">
  <strong><em>Gundarlun.</em></strong> Gundarlun, west of Neverwinter, experiences wintry weather
  most of the year, and its Northlander population is regularly terrorized by Arveiaturace, a white
  dragon from the North. Off the island’s southwest coast lies the wreck of the
  <em>Golden Crown</em>, a Calishite merchant vessel that was carrying a vast cargo of gold, silver,
  electrum, and gemstones when it sank in a storm. A wizard named Hoch Miraz also went down with the
  ship. Its treasure has never been recovered.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3b59f96-861c-4432-94f3-57eccb0fcebb">
  <strong><em>Maelstrom.</em></strong> The storm giant stronghold of Maelstrom sits on the seafloor
  somewhere between Ruathym, the Whalebones, and the Moonshaes. Serissa, the titular queen of all
  giantkind, resides here. A natural whirlpool occasionally manifests far above the palace, wrecking
  ships and dragging them down to the seafloor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="afeacd54-a2a2-46b0-badb-0f13580a142a">
  <strong><em>Mother-of-Mists.</em></strong> Adventurers from

  <a href="#Lantan" data-content-chunk-id="08ea8565-28ec-458a-b1d3-e47903c52573">Lantan</a> alike
  have journeyed to Mother-of-Mists in search of treasure, finding nothing but danger. Poisonous
  vapors and smoke mix with cold sea winds to create the ever-present mists for which this volcanic
  island is known.
</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="879363d1-db33-4c36-aa04-710c81b2c45c">
  <strong><em>The Nelanther.</em></strong> Riddled with communities of monstrous pirates, the
  Nelanther islands have few resources and are plagued with infighting. Ancient towers guarded by
  monsters and magic wards jut from several of the isles and even from the sea itself. The
  Nelanther’s pirates avoid these towers out of a mix of fear and superstition.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd3edbe2-ee6d-408d-8e5a-951e0b44feef">
  <strong><em>Northlander Isles.</em></strong> Norlander culture originated long ago on the bleak,
  mountainous island of Ruathym in the Northlander Isles, north of the
  <a href="#Moonsea" data-content-chunk-id="a332a1c6-8b75-445f-b9c0-28b4e2308ccc">Moonsea</a> Isles.
  Most Norlanders left these isles long ago in favor of more hospitable climates, but a few
  scattered steadings remain. Queen Forfallen, a Rusted pirate queen and Norlander, uses Ruathym as
  a safe port.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4717e165-ee96-462b-a8e2-4125c717a3b9">
  <strong><em>Purple Rocks.</em></strong> Few have visited the distant Purple Rocks archipelago, far
  to the west of Neverwinter and so named because it appears dark purple under stormy skies. Those
  who return report its friendly inhabitants sport odd piscine features and also note an odd lack of
  children and elders.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1d41c72-cd63-4b70-bd0e-a23cf5d21f47">
  <strong><em>Sea of Swords.</em></strong> The Sea of Swords is a cold and storm-wracked gulf. Most
  of the
  <a href="#SwordCoast" data-content-chunk-id="46f75452-15bb-4b00-b6f6-3648973f4576">Sword Coast</a
  >’s trade routes hug close to the shore.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd808607-1d40-420d-85ef-cb7a876662ec">
  <strong><em>Tuern.</em></strong> Red dragons and fire giants war constantly on the volcanic island
  of Tuern, far to the north and west. For decades, they demanded tribute from Tuern’s Humanoid
  population. When the people finally refused, the dragons and giants began conscripting them as
  disposable infantry in their brutal wars. People in
  <a href="#Mintarn" data-content-chunk-id="ef50df58-826f-48ed-96ec-9061b0f18f7f">Mintarn</a> who
  have heard of Tuern see it as a cautionary tale.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a2fd4eb0-d188-4c70-bedf-8bf014b561da">
  <strong><em>Whalebones.</em></strong> Whales come to die for reasons unknown at a set of islands
  called the Whalebones. The shores are littered with their bleached-white bones. Rocs perch on the
  mountaintops while petty self-proclaimed “kings” of the tiny islets squabble among each other for
  power.

  <strong><em>Denizens of the Deep.</em></strong> Entire realms lie hidden beneath Faerûn’s waves.
  Storm giants live in great palaces on the seafloor. Merfolk live in sunlit shallows, while
  monstrous merrow and sahuagin lair in dark grottoes but surface to feast on innocents. Sea elves
  are much rarer in the Trackless Sea than they are in the inland Sea of Fallen Stars, as they’re
  hunted relentlessly in these waters by sahuagin and their malenti spies—a breed of sahuagin with
  the appearance of sea elves.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b5a41fb-ff8a-4ea7-a00f-9362ee3e955b">
  <strong><em>Piracy.</em></strong> Pirates abound in the Trackless Sea. Norlander culture has a
  long history of piracy and raiding, sometimes harrying the mainland’s merchant vessels along the
  Sea of Swords. Mercenaries from
  <a href="#Mintarn" data-content-chunk-id="ea137e35-d664-4ff8-a9b4-5856e98a7b32">Mintarn</a> sell
  their services to privateering crews. But the most fearsome pirates hail from the monstrous
  Nelanther Isles. These ogre, lizardfolk, and minotaur buccaneers aren’t bound by codes of honor;
  they torture their victims and leave them to hideous deaths. They prey on the shipping routes of
  <a href="#Amn" data-content-chunk-id="df8fa7dc-0817-4459-895d-e760d9bd2e9d">Amn</a>,

</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b2dbaa9-7d52-4620-8839-d29f9408c683">
  <strong><em>Ships.</em></strong> The lightly built galleys favored in more sheltered waters don’t
  fare well in the winds and storms of the

    >Trackless Sea</a

  and the Moonshaes build swift yet sturdy longships, equipped with smaller, specialized boats
  called whaleboats for whaling. They are among the most recognizable ships on the seas, but a
  trained eye can recognize any vessel’s land of origin by its size, shape, and build, even if the
  ship isn’t flying any flags.

  are ever-wary of Umberlee, the Wavemother. Cultists strike fear into the hearts of sailors,
  warning of Umberlee’s ire and demanding passage on ships. Each coastal city maintains shrines to
  the cruel sea god, and sailors leave flowers or small candies in hopes Umberlee will show mercy on
  a ship’s next voyage. Savvy pirate crews have been known to recruit priests of Umberlee to trap
  unsuspecting merchant ships in whirlpools or devastate towns with tsunamis before a pillage.

  Today, Chondath is but a shell of its former glory. Its capital city Arrabar still stands,
  desperately demanding increasingly exorbitant taxes from the tiny towns of Samra, Timindar, and

  <strong><em>Port Nyanzaru.</em></strong> Port Nyanzaru hugs the coastline at the south end of the
  Bay of Chult. It’s a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city—the only city in Chult that
  isn’t in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. The city is run by seven influential merchant
  princes. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the
  streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races’ outcomes. The city also
  boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.

  Evermeet
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ad443ca5-ba23-4352-b64a-64108a60bace">
  Almost twenty thousand years ago, elves used high magic to create a homeland for themselves. In
  the process, they devastated Toril in a cataclysmic disaster eventually known as the Sundering.
  But the island they created, Evermeet, remains. Elves from across Faerûn eventually travel to the
  island.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3112e37e-a5fc-4eb8-a2f5-254d8cf66320">
  Evermeet is protected by many layers of defenses. First, it is magically warded to prevent
  navigators from finding the island. Winds and subtle currents turn ships aside, stars move in the
  sky, and powerful illusions hide the island itself. Only navigators entrusted with secret
  knowledge can find the way.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79f894b9-8196-4b0c-9dfd-83f63f4462e2">
  Second, a great navy shields Evermeet from enemies and allows the island nation to project its
  power into Faerûn when necessary. Elf merchants bring goods from Evermeet to markets in Faerûn and
  import anything the elves can’t make themselves.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="406c612b-f965-4eda-970d-041913ee8ff8">
  Finally, the capital city of Leuthilspar is protected by magically constructed walls of glass.
  Evermeet’s Royal Council meets here.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7e20b9d-aa07-4b11-bb74-1cf04b455fca">
  Evermeet lies at a conjunction of three planes of existence: the Material Plane, the Feywild, and
  Arvandor. Non-elves aren’t permitted to visit, but on very rare occasions, exceptions have been
  made, and at least one gnome has managed to reach the island by stowing away with an elf traveler.

<p data-content-chunk-id="4ec9c016-beb0-4b8d-884d-ec8f7632c6b0">
  With independent city-states on the north shore and a succession of small countries founded or
  conquered by people of many different agendas to the south, the Lake of Steam is a hodgepodge of
  varying interests, bustling trade, and frequently changing boundaries. Most of the cities on the
  north shore were part of
  <a href="#Calimshan" data-content-chunk-id="e9aa99b0-1d7f-47b0-82c7-48ead0f2de0e">Calimshan</a> in
  the past and retain Calimshan’s desire for wealth, comfort, and influence, as well as a strong
  desire to remain independent. The intrigues brewing around these cities led observers to dub the
  northern shore the Moonsea of the South.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89596cab-273a-470e-b817-c2aeafd09628">
  The Border Kingdoms on the southern shore are the homes of powerful adventurers of many types,
  each seeking to carve out a piece of land and rule it in the manner they prefer … at least until
  the next would-be ruler decides to take over. Wizard towers, monasteries, fortresses, and temples
  dot the Border Kingdoms, only to have their owners replaced time and again.

  <strong><em>Ankhapur.</em></strong> The city of Ankhapur boasts a thriving industry centered on
  pearls retrieved from the stinking yellow water of the Lake of Steam. The magnificent pearls
  prized from oysters that grow to enormous size fetch high prices in the markets of

  The Shaar
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c793b504-dd50-4680-ab0f-8d766055f870">
  The Shaar is a vast, rolling grassland running from the Shining Sea to the distant lands of the
  east. Nomadic humans (the dozen or so tribes of the Shaaryan), centaurs, and gnolls populate the
  Shaar, hunting and herding various animals, and occasionally raiding each other. The land supports
  its native grasses splendidly but is ill suited for agriculture—it’s not a desert, but the land
  bakes by day and freezes by night.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f789b0a8-beca-4a48-809f-df144798c167">
  The dozen or so nomad tribes known collectively as the Shaaryan have never been unified, though
  they share a common culture and way of life. Shaaryan humans seldom stray in large numbers from
  their ancestral plains, largely because their horses don’t do well outside the Shaar.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c9311ac-3e08-4e07-ac62-3f0ac4591f9c">
  <strong><em>Lhesper.</em></strong> This ruined city is home to a powerful clan of yuan-ti. Human
  travelers along the shores of Lake Lhespen often fall prey to bandits under yuan-ti domination and
  are carried back to a terrible fate in Lhesper—usually sacrifice to the yuan-ti’s evil god, but
  sometimes transformation into monstrous servitors to the serpent race. The Shaaryan give it a wide
  berth.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2a0f73b2-31d2-40c6-815d-6cccb8bbcc7b">
  <strong><em>Shaarmid.</em></strong> A free trading city populated mostly by human folk who claim
  no kinship with the Shaaryan nomads, Shaarmid is accepted by the tribes as a longtime ally because
  the city’s people have a history of brokering excellent deals for the nomads with the traders from
  the rest of Faerûn. Merchants flock to Shaarmid for safety from Shaaryan bandits and other
  raiders.

  kinds of meat to trade with the people of the glacier. Some Sossrim wield druidic magic to bend
  plants to their will, pass through undergrowth impenetrable to others, or even transport
  themselves from one tree to another. In fact, the ornate and smoothly shaped Sossar furniture sold
