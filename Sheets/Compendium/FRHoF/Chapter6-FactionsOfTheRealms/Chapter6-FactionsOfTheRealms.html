  Many in Faerûn seek power and prosperity, but few can achieve their ambitions alone. Instead,
  individuals join influential groups called factions. Adventurers who join a faction stand to gain
  honors, privileges, wealth, and, above all, respect.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98458be6-4e20-4c42-98e1-58b3740340c0">
  Each faction has its own vision for Faerûn, and these imagined ideals are rarely fully compatible.
  When their goals conflict, factions form rivalries. Conversely, when one faction overextends
  itself or becomes too strong, its rivals band together to balance the scales of power. Frequent
  cooperation might eventually lead to alliances, though these partnerships are rarely made
  official.

      The Cult of the Dragon is a centuries-old cabal of evil mages, doomsayers, and dragon
      worshipers. Its members believe in apocalyptic prophecies that center on dragons as the
      world’s inevitable destroyers (or, rarely, its saviors). To hasten the end times, cultists
      enact elaborate rituals to empower or summon evil dragons.

      Goals and Activities
    </h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="91aa6ad2-2adb-4a99-a284-5aaf459df461">
      The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence isn’t. Most folk in Faerûn
      have heard of the cult but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits
      new members in major cities, where many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned
      to ordinary academic research. Only a few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9920a6cc-6990-4614-8e54-6a42a5eabb1a">
  At its outset, the Cult of the Dragon primarily concerned itself with the creation and worship of
  dracoliches—powerful undead dragons the cult believes will inevitably rule Faerûn—through rituals
  detailed in the [magicitems]Tome of the Dragon[/magicitems]. More recently, however, the cult has
  splintered, with many within the cult committing themselves to Tiamat, the evil Queen of Dragons.
  This splinter group elevates Tiamat above other divinities and looks forward to the Dragon Queen’s
  return, believing that she—not dracoliches—will destroy civilization, usher in a glorious reign of
  dragons, and reward those who helped bring about draconic rule.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc92c2a5-b9c0-49ff-860c-7db3f216a5a7">
  Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult’s regalia: a cape or cloak cut to
  resemble dragon wings, plus clothing, jewelry, and draconic accessories reflecting the wearer’s
  favorite type of dragon. Masks—especially masks of dragons—are common at cult gatherings, and many
  cultists craft their own masks.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3452d9d2-cdda-4f95-acb4-89be7f4cd709">
  Cultists avoid wearing this regalia in public, but anyone who knows what to look for can often
  pick an incognito dragon cultist out of a crowd. The most recognizable tell is the sign of Tiamat,
  a gesture cultists who revere the Dragon Queen use to greet one another: right hand extended, palm
  forward, with five fingers spread in imitation of Tiamat’s five heads.

  Leadership and Organization
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="935389f1-47e3-47f5-b34c-69551cdf2513">
  The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks
  for cultists, and one highest rank for the Wearers of Purple—the leaders and cult masters of
  particular locales. The cult is ruled by secretive Wearers of Purple called wyrmspeakers—a term of
  respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d890d8d6-b537-4417-84cd-a1d5b9fbc79b">
  Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates have no rank and
  follow the orders of their superiors. Only initiates that prove their worth can advance. A Wearer
  of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of dragonclaw (first rank), dragonwing (second
  rank), dragonfang (third rank), and dragonsoul (fourth rank).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db812efb-54e7-4565-8a9d-89401cc68b23">
  Cult operation groups vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to
  hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple, depending
  on their assigned tasks.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Cells" data-content-chunk-id="111ae8a8-8418-4ada-8a14-4dc4beeaed90">
  Cells
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9be67b09-ef6f-45c8-9900-0e68de92eaef">
  The Cult of the Dragon consists of countless cells spread across Faerûn. Each cell is led by one
  or more Wearers of Purple who report to the cult’s wyrmspeakers, typically via magical
  correspondence. Cells have their own agendas but must conform with the wyrmspeakers’ doctrine or
  else face expulsion from the order.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1ab8713f-bd49-47f0-89a1-6dcbe3b6b9fd">
  Low-ranking cultists have little reason and few opportunities to interact with cultists outside
  their own cell.
</p>
<h4

  Recruitment
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc17d318-ab12-420d-a0e6-108d580c4295">
  The Cult of the Dragon is always seeking to expand its ranks. New recruits are encouraged to bring
  trusted family members and friends for conversion. The next most common form of recruitment is
  tried-and-true abduction combined with cult indoctrination. Cultists also sometimes recruit
  undead, fey, or other monsters.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e2735a3-978f-455e-8693-09c4d6fd2128">
  Cult leaders aren’t opposed to hiring mercenaries for specific jobs or when ranks are thin. The
  cult casts a wide net with vaguely worded fliers on job boards or shadowy brokers posted in dark
  tavern corners; higher-ranking cultists then cherry-pick the most promising (that is, manipulable)
  prospects. In this way, countless soldiers of fortune, run-of-the-mill toughs, and even seasoned
  adventurers have unwittingly undertaken missions for the cult. Some complete their job none the
  wiser of their involvement in the cult’s schemes. Others discover the ruse in time to flee. An
  unsavory few catch on to the true nature of their work and use the opportunity to seek admission
  to the cult.

  Wearers of Purple
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d864bb5b-6386-4082-984c-355086e2b52e">
  The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult’s hierarchy, and their word is law for the
  cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult
  to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an
  affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers
  of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all can marshal the cult’s resources
  at will.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a56acf27-1c1e-41db-b71f-1f3dbbad3b2b">
  Only the cult’s inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that
  character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a
  working relationship with a dragon or dracolich as part of their power and authority. Those who
  don’t cultivate this relationship are sometimes demoted. Several priests of Tiamat have recently
  been made Wearers of Purple and are establishing temples for her open worship in Faerûn.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01acbe25-d536-49fe-9d79-116165bcb3ee">
  <strong><em>Wyrmspeakers.</em></strong> Five Wearers of Purple conduct the cult’s
  farthest-reaching plans. The members of this inner circle each wear a different colored dragon
  mask that hides their true identities. They call themselves wyrmspeakers, and members of the cult
  fear their power over dragons. Each wyrmspeaker has an affinity for a particular color of
  chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause,
  and plan cult missions that advance the cult’s plots.

  Leaving the Cult
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6bc5045-ff72-4cb0-91f3-c0ca0e6b70ca">
  Once initiated, a cultist belongs to the cult for life. Those who escape the cult spend the rest
  of their days fearful of every shadow and stranger, for the cult doesn’t take kindly to deserters.
  In exceptionally rare cases, a cult member might be excommunicated yet allowed to live. The price
  of this mercy is never cheap; exiled cultists must usually give up all their memories to
  mind-obliterating magic or commit some unspeakable act the cult can later use as blackmail if
  needed.

  Any character might associate with the Cult of the Dragon, even those who aren’t evil. Desperate
  times can push good-natured people to beseech the cult for a favor. Cultists often blackmail
  innocent people—including cultists’ own family members—into doing work for the cult. A character
  could be aiding the cult unwittingly (even if you, the player, know the truth).

  The Cult of the Dragon conducts sacrificial rituals to advance its esoteric goals. But not all the
  cult’s sacrificial victims perish in the ordeal. A rare few emerge from the ritual not just alive,
  but changed. Such survivors are said to be “marked by the dragon.” Some call these individuals
  dragonscarred. Different cells treat dragonscarred differently. Some view them as monstrous and
  exile them from the cult’s territory. Others treat dragonscarred well, elevating them to higher
  stations in the cult.

      A ranger guards a caravan through monster-plagued wilds. Forest defenders dismantle a war camp
      polluting a vital river. A circle of druids enacts a rain ritual for a drought-stricken

      The Emerald Enclave is an organization of survivalists and nature worshipers who refer to
      themselves as Caretakers. Members of the enclave maintain the balance between wilderness and
      civilization and reinforce what they call “the natural order.” This natural order is
      exemplified by places where people and nature live in harmony—places where neither settlements
      nor wilds threaten to overwhelm the other. Caretakers protect such areas with their lives. To
      the Emerald Enclave, individual sacrifice is worthwhile if it means the preservation of the
      whole.

  Caretakers wear green clothes made from natural, foraged materials such as plants and animal
  hides. The most powerful members have magically bright-green eyes. Most Caretakers are constantly
  surrounded by animals and can walk seamlessly between civilization and the wilds.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa02acea-b2da-45d1-a27e-e67a111d6666">
  Members of the Emerald Enclave are loosely organized into diffuse subfactions called circles. Some
  Caretakers from the same circle might work together in small bands, but many operate in isolation.
  These lone wolves rely on the animals and plants around them to monitor other Caretakers (and
  non-Caretakers) in their vicinity.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9327a1a5-7ad9-4456-8488-209e2e979f30">
  Caretakers preserve sacred natural sites by guarding them from logging, mining, and other
  exploitation. In areas where the natural order has already been compromised, the enclave restores
  the land so it is once again fruitful and hospitable. The enclave’s spellcasters draw on nature
  magic to expedite labors such as planting trees and cleaning litter-filled waterways.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbbe9dcc-8da7-44bf-9d68-eb0f0498b3ad">
  In dire situations—such as an undead-riddled battlefield—the Emerald Enclave leads coordinated
  assaults to root out the land’s defilers. When necessary, Caretakers put impenitent evildoers to
  the sword. Members of the enclave don’t relish violence against nature’s children, but they know
  destruction is sometimes necessary for healing to begin. Caretakers do, however, proudly raise
  arms against unnatural forces such as aberrant monsters, reanimated dead, and machines of war.
  Members of the enclave believe such creatures exist to threaten the natural order and must be
  destroyed.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15cec41b-c38e-4dd4-a1d7-e7a974d4f668">
  When they aren’t healing broken lands or fending off the forces of chaos, Caretakers study and
  promote the ways that fauna and flora peacefully coexist in nature. Some spend time in settlements
  to forge new connections and encourage communities to tend the world around them. The enclave is
  always in search of allies, for, as one Caretaker saying puts it, the herd is strongest when its
  numbers are great. Thus, wise Caretakers hone their communication skills, knowing that a
  compelling speech or poignant adage can help others connect to the land.
</p>

  Lunar Rituals
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b3787f5-003f-4a9e-91a2-4c3b9d83d962">
  The cycle of the moon and seasons is important to the Emerald Enclave’s rituals. New Caretakers
  are initiated to the enclave each month on the full moon. New moons are reserved for tribunals,
  when judgment is passed on enemies taken prisoner or on Caretakers who’ve failed to uphold their
  duties. Many Caretakers plan sojourns to coincide with the lunar cycle so that they venture away
  from home while the moon wanes, then return while it waxes.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c052406-2468-408f-8284-3d38608358e7">
  Just as the enclave shares in times of bounty, so too it shares the onus of performing necessary
  evils. When a tribunal demands capital punishment or a lunar ritual requires animal sacrifice, the
  tribunal selects an executioner through a casting of holy stones or sacred sticks or the summoning
  of a nature spirit that temporarily possesses an individual. In this way, no single Caretaker must
  bear the entire weight of the grisly work that must be done.

  A Caretaker who achieves acclaim might take an epithet. Typically such an epithet is bestowed by
  another Caretaker to commemorate a worthy deed. Storied Caretakers have multiple epithets, which
  are then appended to one another; for example, a veteran enclave member named Krodar might be
  referred to as “Caretaker Krodar, Axe Breaker, and Tamer of Owlbears.”

  Enclave Circles
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9811e8f9-3fdf-4ee1-a68b-4183893e1999">
  A circle of the Emerald Enclave is a collective of Caretakers who study and practice the teachings
  of a particular aspect of the natural world to achieve the enclave’s goals. Circles act
  independently, but they might seek one another’s expertise when dealing with large-scale or
  far-ranging challenges.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="474a587c-500c-42b8-b097-f50c2a3668b2">
  There is some overlap between enclave circles and druid circles. But not all druids belong to the
  Emerald Enclave, and not all enclave members are druids. A druid of the Circle of the Moon, for
  example, might go their entire life without encountering the Emerald Enclave’s circle of the same
  name, even though both groups practice similar teachings and rituals.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a07d446-953a-4ae7-a38d-3913d2693228">
  Each circle is led by its longest-serving and most accomplished members: sage rangers and ancient
  druids known as Verdant Ones. Verdant Ones lead lunar rituals, train new Caretakers, and
  coordinate missions with other circles. Often, a Verdant One passes judgment on issues where the
  balance between natural forces is unclear.

  The Three
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af2b07a6-d8b2-422f-8788-0e625c88b71f">
  The leaders of the Emerald Enclave are called the Three. These legendary druids provide guidance
  to other enclave circles and pass judgment on the most serious offenses. They occupy and protect a
  sacred temple to Silvanus called Oakenhall. Rarely the Three might visit another sacred site; such
  visits are never announced and rarely portend good news.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdf6a01b-fcac-4fd2-8d20-1dc18ce8d9d2">
  Though rarely spoken of as individuals, the Three are sometimes identified by the leaf-shaped
  masks they wear: the Oak, the Elm, and the Willow. The Three began as ordinary people, but when an
  individual dons one of these three magical masks, the mask merges with their flesh and transforms
  the wearer into a faceless, ageless being of no known species—nine feet tall and identical to the
  other members.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1c44b388-a763-4b4a-b679-3b5a385f7448">
  All over Faerûn, Caretakers congregate at meeting grounds called sacred sites. Except for
  Oakenhall and a few other notable temples, the Emerald Enclave’s sacred sites are naturally
  occurring locales of spiritual or magical import. The Emerald Enclave considers these sites—and
  any other locations where nature has worked its miracles—symbolically important and worth guarding
  closely. The following are a few notable sacred sites.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="65e9c642-67e9-4026-b390-2414396fc9e5">
  <strong><em>Coltree.</em></strong> In the foothills around the Spine of the World grows a massive
  fir called Coltree. It rises from a white granite slope ribboned with thick veins of exposed coal
  that give the landscape a zebra-like appearance.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="315eb0a3-7b07-4dc5-94ad-cea3a9251e9e">
  <strong><em>Moraeire.</em></strong> Moraeire is a blue-tinted stone column in a valley of similar
  pillars off the west coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The valley is flooded most of the year,
  creating a unique ecosystem that’s part bog, part canyon.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe246638-afed-47e9-83ea-45bd6355255f">
  <strong><em>Silver Tear.</em></strong> The Silver Tearin Anauroch is an underground oasis at the
  center of a massive grotto. Its exact location is secret, but the entrance lies somewhere at the
  bottom of a steep gorge riddled with red caves.

<p data-content-chunk-id="070a566e-147f-4acb-a01f-d14e9494bb61">
  Characters gain renown with the Emerald Enclave by defending nature against would-be despoilers
  and by completing tasks for enclave members. As their Renown Score increases, characters gain
  access to various perks, as shown on the Emerald Enclave Renown table. If your campaign doesn’t
  use renown, your DM decides if and when characters earn these perks.

</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09d49a9b-ed79-4480-9ba5-471ec129da73">
  Harpers are secretive spies, sleuths, and skalds who oppose evil throughout the Forgotten Realms.
  Harpers believe that power, fortune, and knowledge should be shared by all rather than hoarded by
  the few. They are disinterested in fame and glory—whatever they do, they do for the common good,
  with no expectation of reward.

      Harpers employ magic, subterfuge, and wit to achieve their aims, preferably without arousing
      any suspicion of their interference. They favor subtle manipulation to overt action—a Harper
      is more likely to turn enemies against one another than to stick a dagger in a despot’s back.
      Better yet is depriving bad actors of power in the first place, such as by securing dangerous
      magical weapons before they fall into the wrong hands. Yet for all their behind-the-scenes
      action, Harpers are well known among both downtrodden common folk, who laud them as heroes,
      and the forces of evil, who scorn them as meddlers.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef39b4bc-90e6-4c67-b881-c3483971983c">
  The Harpers’ primary goals are to free the oppressed and dismantle the power structures that
  enable such oppression. To achieve the former, Harpers commit heroic deeds and dispense useful
  knowledge in equal measure. To someone who says, “Give folks a fish, and they’ll eat today—teach
  them how to fish, and they’ll eat for the rest of their lives,” a Harper says, “Why not both?”
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f31e2546-5a52-4fe9-81f9-08c374bf2437">
  When it comes to disarming evildoers, Harpers monitor political powers and employ covert action
  when necessary. They don’t rush into confrontation when there’s time to study the situation and
  develop a cohesive plan. On the other hand, no Harper would hesitate to help someone in imminent
  danger. A Harper balances the desire to gather information and the need to act quickly.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ed49fe0-2579-46ae-8c72-8233064b84be">
  Harpers’ secondary goals are many, and the prioritization of these goals is a matter of individual
  discretion. Silver-tongued Harpers focus their talents on the advancement of the order’s virtues,
  especially fairness and equality. Harpers with a penchant for magic undertake missions to protect
  or destroy potentially harmful magic items. And, of course, Harpers who simply want to punish the
  wicked and save the innocent have no trouble finding opportunities to do just that.
</p>
<h4
  class="compendium-hr"

  Harper Code
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7548fbd-6312-4afe-85fb-74d3ac4918ed">
  Harpers follow a loose set of guiding ideals called the Harper code. Like the order itself, the
  code is in a state of constant flux, growing, shrinking, and changing to fit the needs of the
  time. But some tenets, such as fairness and equality, remain much as they were when the order was
  first founded.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da5dd98f-9de3-438f-98b9-fa73bebce142">
  <strong><em>Watchwords.</em></strong> The Harper code is organized into a system of phrases called
  watchwords. Harpers coin and recite watchwords to guide their actions in uncertain situations.
  Harpers exchange watchwords with one another as pass phrases or to verify identities. Senior
  Harpers pass down watchwords in their sacred rites of initiation and in the training of new
  recruits.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6ca114c-a9ef-4677-b91e-823966d8fd8d">
  Some Harpers carry a small book in which they collect or pen watchwords, but the Harper code has
  no official canon. Still, a few watchwords are so common that all Harpers can be expected to know
  them. Examples include the following:
</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="29821ae5-fab3-4499-b040-b40593eee37d">
  <li data-content-chunk-id="8a956245-7b6b-40f1-91e5-eeaae6a26d2c">
    No one is free until all are free.
  </li>
  <li data-content-chunk-id="ff4fccad-91c9-40ab-891d-d3b10babed7d">
    Whatever it takes, a Harper will do.
  </li>
  <li data-content-chunk-id="5a933088-4ded-4e35-9bb5-cbf1709c7fea">
    Study the past to preserve the future.
  </li>
  <li data-content-chunk-id="5c13f996-f631-47d4-a6d7-56394eae78ba">
    For freedom to flourish, there must be balance.

  Leadership and Organization
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9061e5b8-d761-4ec6-ade2-1723098fe6de">
  The Harpers are scattered, with neither a strict hierarchy nor a centralized place of command.
  Rather, they consist of many small cells and lone agents who operate within a vast, loose network.
  This open and resilient structure has enabled the Harpers to form, disband, and re-form many times
  in the history of the Realms.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b7acdcab-08fe-41b3-8b23-9ab7ed6a26bf">
  As befits their ethos, there is no one leader of the Harpers. Authority and responsibility are
  shared equally among members. That said, veteran Harpers have broader access to useful contacts
  and greater knowledge of goings on simply by virtue of having been around longer, and novice
  Harpers tend to take missions and receive counsel from their more experienced peers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b063f623-7d88-41b8-a2bd-2a4371cc2eba">
  Harpers have strong bonds with their fellow Harpers. Feuds or even friendly rivalries among
  members are rare. A Harper never hesitates to help a fellow Harper in need.

  Harper Cells and Strongholds
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea6e3366-c5d8-4a67-b667-9e73325ceb36">
  Although they range across Faerûn, Harpers aren’t a unified force. Some Harpers act mostly
  independently, but many belong to a local Harper cell—a collective of Harpers who share
  information and undertake missions together. These cells are differentiated by the location of
  their strongholds (if they have one), their local notoriety, and what parts of the Harper code
  they consider most important.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0e92f93-4ead-4d0e-bbe4-fd87890fafae">
  The Harpers of Twilight Hall in Berdusk, for example, work in coordinated groups to achieve
  long-range plans. Harpers based out of Silverymoon, on the other hand, emphasize the responsible
  use of magic and securing dangerous Artifacts. Yet another example is Harpers like those led by
  Storm Silverhand in Shadowdale: lone wolves who conduct themselves like secret agents.

  Joining the Harpers
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f71f45b2-49b3-4ed9-ac8e-5ef395cddc45">
  A person doesn’t simply become a Harper—they have to be chosen by a Harper to receive the honor.
  Harpers observe potential candidates from afar to assess their words and deeds. Candidates deemed
  worthy are approached by a Harper in disguise who poses a test of the individual’s character. This
  test is typically a fabricated moral dilemma or a veiled choice between self-enrichment and
  self-sacrifice. To ensure their motives are true, a candidate shouldn’t know they are being
  observed or tested.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8f01f78f-9504-415e-87f6-66ee23d31614">
  A candidate who passes the secret test is eventually apprised of the gambit and invited to the
  Harpers. To join the order, the individual must swear an oath before a council of senior Harpers
  to uphold the Harper code. Once an individual swears this oath, they must uphold it for life.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d87a2a9-ff83-4d90-a314-7a4f617b507c">
  Ex-Harpers are rare for two reasons. First, the process for testing new Harpers is rigorous enough
  to weed out most candidates unwilling to maintain the oath. Second, the punishment for betraying
  the Harpers is severe, summarized by this watchword: Traitors must die. The few Harpers who
  abandon their oath—or who commit an offense that doesn’t warrant death—are cast out of the order.
  Atonement is sometimes possible, but it is a long and arduous endeavor.

  High Harpers
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c60c01a-1e47-444d-b269-fd7e75a9c6a5">
  Harpers are equal in rank with one notable exception: the High Harpers. These mysterious figures
  are responsible for the Harpers’ long-term planning and the order’s greatest campaigns against
  evil. High Harpers are voted into their position by a secret ballot among other High Harpers, who
  select candidates from among the order’s most accomplished and capable individuals.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da284bf2-e73e-42ba-bf1b-14323c65a165">
  The High Harpers rarely convene, and when they do, it is a truly momentous—or dire—occasion.
  Someone who seeks an audience with the High Harpers might wait many moons before receiving their
  counsel, if it is ever granted. But the wait is worthwhile; the High Harpers’ favor is a great
  honor and a tremendous resource.

  Harper Personas
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99a82fdc-253e-4bcd-bc2e-ba9a22aea031">
  Harpers are masters of disguise and improvisation. The best Harpers develop a repertoire of false
  identities—called personas—to assume at a moment’s notice. Veteran Harpers sometimes teach these
  personas to fellow Harpers or allies. Much in the way a knight might pass on their precious sword
  or shield to a squire, a Harper might bequeath the tale and attire of a persona to a less
  experienced Harper.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4513336c-7600-444d-bf27-666392af265b">
  Harper personas share tropes or fall into recognizable archetypes. When allies recognize a
  persona, they realize it’s a Harper and play along. When a persona becomes too well known, Harpers

      The Lords’ Alliance is an association of nobles and rulers representing settlements across
      western Faerûn. The alliance believes that solidarity is the surest means to keep the forces
      of chaos at bay and secure prosperity for people throughout the North. Agents of the alliance
      ensure the safety and prosperity of their settlements by proactively eliminating forces that
      threaten civilization.

      The alliance’s primary goal is to ensure the safety and prosperity of cities and other
      settlements across Faerûn. To accomplish this, alliance members share information with one
      another about potential threats within and near alliance territory. Dangers are many in
      Faerûn, leaving the alliance spread thin, so settlements hire reputable adventurers and
      dispatch them where they are most needed.

  Although the alliance’s mere existence is a strong deterrent against evildoers, it has a
  reputation for internal bickering and dysfunction. Alliance representatives are aware of this
  reputation, and they go to great lengths to exhibit solidarity and coordination. Cities in the
  alliance frequently sponsor tournaments, festivals, and fundraisers to increase the perception of
  a unified North.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="25cd2768-9488-4117-97d8-30105f85ecc9">
  Many within the Lords’ Alliance believe the best defense is a strong offense and that the alliance
  should proactively eliminate threats. Alliance leaders pressure one another to keep their borders
  well guarded. Members frequently hire adventuring parties for scouting missions and forays into
  monster nests, thieves’ dens, and cultist hideouts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07c97cfa-d35c-4fd6-b702-e43514186fc8">
  Agents of the alliance swear allegiance to a specific lord. These lords tend to be self-concerned
  and proud, and they expect their agents to act nobly and bring honor to them. The lords engage in
  friendly competition over their agents’ contributions. Should Waterdeep’s militia prove integral
  to the routing of an invading army, for example, Open Lord Laeral

  Each member of the Lords’ Alliance has an official representative on the alliance’s governing
  body, the Council of Lords. Typically this representative is the settlement’s ruler. When
  necessary, a representative can select a proxy to stand in the representative’s place.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b7aa384-5ea6-46ba-aada-6655901c7054">
  Representatives convene several times per year for a Lords’ Assembly. These assemblies occur
  around the same time as the festivals that mark the changing of the seasons. Alliance members take
  turns hosting assemblies, with preference given to cities that have suitably large (and secure)
  forum spaces. During times of crisis, such as war or catastrophe, an emergency assembly might be
  called.

  and their representatives on the Council of Lords. New members join occasionally, and members
  sometimes leave the alliance or are expelled.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3727365c-d19a-4575-8ab1-f3a22efed2fb">
  <strong><em>Amphail.</em></strong> Rivaling Longsaddle for the honor of the alliance’s smallest
  settlement, Amphail is best known as a playground for bored nobles from Waterdeep. Petty family
  feuds are the order of the day in Amphail, as are minor catastrophes caused by the unabashed
  negligence of haughty aristocrats. Lord Warder Dauner Ilzimmer speaks for Amphail on the Council
  of Lords, but like most nobles in Amphail, he has little interest in matters that don’t endanger
  his cushy lifestyle.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e36c4e7e-8350-4275-9131-d938bf3f6553">
  <strong><em>Baldur’s Gate.</em></strong> The massive city of Baldur’s Gate is one of the Sword
  Coast’s most powerful trading ports, and Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard’s outsize influence on the
  Council of Lords reflects this. In Baldur’s Gate, criminals, cultists, and corruption hold as much
  (if not more) sway as the city’s nobles. The city requires frequent aid from the Lords’ Alliance
  to maintain order within its walls.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46bc8f44-cee3-40f2-ba68-f13adc7a0358">
  <strong><em>Daggerford.</em></strong> Lady Morwen Daggerford oversees the small, walled town of
  Daggerford, surrounded by floodplains and pastures. It is a key stopover for caravans headed to
  Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, and this function as a watering hole and supply outfitter makes
  Daggerford a vital member of the alliance. Daggerford is the kind of idyllic town that settlements
  in the North aspire to be, with lively taverns and merry festivals that draw visitors from all
  around.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3859d62-7a99-4f1f-a9fb-40b32e3f65dd">
  <strong><em>Longsaddle.</em></strong> Longsaddle is an unassuming hamlet of ranchers, butchers,
  and farriers famous for a family of wizards, the Harpells, who call it home. Dowell Harpell is
  Longsaddle’s representative to the Lords’ Alliance, though the wizard exhibits little interest in
  foreign affairs and rarely speaks during assemblies.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6d6b3dd-86f9-406b-9c7d-970b5b55b517">
  <strong><em>Mirabar.</em></strong> Humans and dwarves are the primary residents of Mirabar, an
  ancient city built partly belowground. The city’s lifeblood is its gem mines, and Marchion Selin
  Ramur jockeys for resources from the Lords’ Alliance to protect Mirabar’s vast stores of wealth.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fea59c33-9cea-4db4-bc97-6d129c3ff3cf">
  <strong><em>Mithral Hall.</em></strong> Mithral Hall is the ancestral home of the famous
  Battlehammer dwarven clan. Despite its status as an alliance member, Mithral Hall is more of a
  stronghold than a settlement, with tunnels to other dwarf holds hidden deep below its mines. Queen
  Dagnabbet Waybeard represents Mithral Hall on the Council of Lords; a bold leader and a fierce
  warrior, she firmly supports Mithral Hall’s membership in the Lords’ Alliance despite other
  dwarven settlements’ reluctance to join the coalition. The queen’s proxy on the council is
  Ambassador Connerad Brawnanvil.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54081f33-6cd1-421f-8599-2bf7a4c4a53b">
  <strong><em>Neverwinter.</em></strong> The City of Skilled Hands is no stranger to the threats
  that the Lords’ Alliance was formed to rally against—ancient monsters, agents of Thay, devils from
  the Nine Hells, and more have endangered Neverwinter in the course of its history. Those who call
  it home are a serious, resilient folk. Dagult Neverember is the city’s present lord protector, and
  he commands the people’s respect.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7c9949c-a98f-4bb8-b2db-2d7f5cd8a1d4">
  <strong><em>Silverymoon.</em></strong> The peaceful city of Silverymoon is a bastion for scholars,
  treasure hunters, and anyone who seeks respite from the harsher realities of the North. It is a
  famous haven for the Harpers and is known for its schools, shrines, and great library. The city’s
  current leader, Lord Methrammar Aerasumé, is a gruff tactician and Silverymoon’s proxy to the
  Council of Lords, but the city’s representative is Methrammar’s predecessor, the wise Lord Taern
  Hornblade.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d26a462-56ea-469a-9806-581409f1163f">
  <strong><em>Waterdeep.</em></strong> Many Waterdhavians become agents of the Lords’ Alliance to
  represent not Waterdeep as a whole but rather one of Waterdeep’s many power-hungry lords. For her
  part, the open lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, uses spies to assess visiting adventurers.
  Those who show potential receive invitations from the city guard to undertake quests for the
  Lords’ Alliance.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bcc2f7d2-7e48-485b-a34f-529087bae318">
  <strong><em>Yartar.</em></strong> Yartar is a fortified town best known for its impressive
  barge-building operation and annual hiring fair, the latter of which attracts adventurers and

  Designing a Coat of Arms
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66b1eca6-cc2b-48cd-a2e7-7cab6b781d7d">
  You can design a coat of arms using the following guidelines. A coat of arms is made of four
  parts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b492ad63-a808-4fe0-8b79-19ccfc311e6e">
  <strong><em>Escutcheon.</em></strong> The escutcheon is the basic shape of the coat of arms, such
  as square, oval, diamond, or kite. A shape can be distinctive, such as the pinched shield of
  Waterdeep.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccea92d9-75ad-4769-8c33-4cc1a5de6428">
  <strong><em>Division.</em></strong> A division is the way in which the escutcheon is partitioned:
  solid, halved, divided into three or four parts, split in half diagonally, checkered, and so on.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbe7e503-64fb-43ea-ac1d-a10235565470">
  <strong><em>Charge.</em></strong> One or more charges, symbols associated with the lord’s
  reputation, are added. Common charges include weapons, armor, monsters, flowers, plants, celestial
  objects, and musical instruments.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c8ebfaf-1b15-42ca-90e9-cb23decac7ea">
  <strong><em>Tinctures.</em></strong> Finally, the coat of arms is distinguished by its tinctures,
  the materials and colors used in the escutcheon and charges. While traditional tinctures include
  colors and metals (such as gold or silver), more fanciful tinctures use illusion magic to create
  shields seemingly made from pure radiance, prismatic light, or shadow.

      The Order of the Gauntlet is a body of faithful justice seekers who seek out and eradicate
      evil. Members of the order must be honorable in their actions, vigilant in their outlook, and
      zealous in their convictions. Moreover, they must always watch out for corruption from within.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b456bb1a-3de8-4e76-b548-453acf7e71fc">
      Most of the order’s knights are heavily armored, many wield shining blades or maces, and all
      wear their holy symbols proudly into battle. They embody virtue for its own sake and model
      ideals of bravery and piousness for the common people they protect. A worthy knight of the
      order risks anything to save a fellow knight or complete an important mission. But knights
      also acknowledge that zealotry can lead to fanaticism, and they caution each other to be wary
      of straying from the path of good.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8eb145ea-59d9-4e2f-94a6-42dccc35be4e">
  A knight follows the order’s creed, the Code of Scales and Weights. They’re devoted to a patron
  deity: typically a good god such as Helm, Tyr, or Torm. Finally, a knight of the order defends
  their companions. To the order, faith is the greatest weapon against evil—faith in oneself, one’s
  god, and one’s friends.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ce24b7a-19f9-4af7-b9db-ac0f5809512c">
  The Order of the Gauntlet is armed and vigilant against evil. Its knights use every resource
  available, including armed reconnaissance, magical scrying, and divine consultation with higher
  powers. To ensure they can act swiftly against the forces of evil, knights maintain fortified
  strongholds along border lands, keep well-stocked armories, and practice daily to remain in peak
  fighting condition.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4633cd53-0ebb-4d38-9ac7-c968a89c41a5">
  The Order of the Gauntlet strives not only to expand the boundaries of just society but to
  maintain justice in lands where it has already taken root. Knights of the order strengthen their
  presence by
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f10aeec1-5503-414a-8fd0-e4933fed3c75">
  establishing chapters—fortresses and strongholds from which knights venture on missions.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bccdd280-3a81-412a-9dc5-b8b3d22d58ce">
  In keeping with their mandate for swift, tough action, knights of the order are neither subtle nor
  discreet. In fact, many knights view any amount of deceit or trickery as cowardice unbefitting a
  member of the Order of the Gauntlet. “There is no shame in doing what is right” is a popular axiom
  used to encourage knights to serve the order openly.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5c0a2ed-2076-4cb0-9672-a88c176d6a3d">
  The order emphasizes retribution rather than proactive measures. Its knights don’t try to predict
  evil or preempt it, believing the practice of trying to preempt villainy, even if well meaning, is
  the first step on the road toward tyranny. As one line in the Code of Scales and Weights puts it,
  knights of the order should strive to “punish evil actions, but not evil thoughts.” The order
  insists on personal freedom, believing that every individual, regardless of their past or
  associates, can act morally and honorably if given the choice.

  Code of Scales and Weights
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbb513f4-cd1c-4291-99b4-77646b0446e4">
  To enact judgment quickly and with certainty, the Order of the Gauntlet relies on a lengthy list
  of crimes and punishments called the Code of Scales and Weights. The Code defines crimes against
  the order (“scales”), as well as appropriate punishments (“weights”).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d580a028-1a26-4bc9-bb70-76ce294eb99b">
  A written version of the Code is available at every chapter of the Order of the Gauntlet. However,
  as every knight knows, evildoers won’t wait patiently for a law enforcer to consult their notes.
  Thus, to be initiated to the order, every aspiring knight must commit the Code to heart and recite
  it before an audience of other knights.
</p>

  Role in War
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb3bb5ee-ade8-4d74-94ce-6a5a2a49d962">
  In times of war, the order’s troops are among the toughest, most steadfast soldiers on the Sword
  Coast. City-states and small nations call on the order to aid their campaigns against injustice.
  However, the order lends its sword only in conflicts of good versus evil; the order is reluctant
  to choose sides in morally ambiguous feuds or petty territorial disputes.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90958b68-a754-4e24-b9e1-7873b2501825">
  In addition to serving as infantry in their own units, veterans of the order act as sergeants or
  commanders for other units. Soldiers have few qualms taking orders from a knight of the Order of
  the Gauntlet; many know the leadership and tactical expertise of the order mean the difference
  between a disorganized defeat and a glorious victory.

<p data-content-chunk-id="94b7dc4a-8833-40c1-8a24-34a3b92d66f0">
  Knights who commit acts of great valor gain rank in the order: knight of the guard (lowest rank),
  knight of the banner (second rank), knight of justice (third rank), or chapter knight (highest
  rank). It’s possible, though rare, for a knight to skip one or more ranks when ascending the
  order’s hierarchy.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="33ca474e-21b9-45d1-ae72-a4ef46c031af">
  Members of the order must respect and follow their superiors. Failure to do so is punished by
  expulsion from the order. This strictness cuts both ways: a high-ranking knight discovered abusing
  their station is tried in the order’s private judicial system, the Court of Justice, and punished
  severely.

  The Order of the Gauntlet judges evildoers summarily and punish them promptly. To determine
  punishments, knights refer to the Code of Scales and Weights or, if in doubt, use a spell such as
  [spells]Commune[/spells] to ask a divinity (typically Tyr or Torm) for guidance. Only in the most
  morally gray situations will knights arrest an offender. Arrested suspects are taken to the
  nearest chapter to undergo a Court of Justice.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5314f7d-dc3c-4e0e-92c7-d8b8c3d9d851">
  A Court of Justice includes interrogations, cross-examinations, and follow-up investigations.

  four veteran chapter knights called high champions (“the Gauntlet’s fingers”). Historically, the
  four high champions have been selected from the upper echelons of the order’s four most prominent
  faiths: the churches of Helm, Hoar, Torm, and Tyr, whose followers founded the Order of the
  Gauntlet.

  worships a righteous god and has a stake in the fight against evil is welcome to petition for
  knighthood. Fighters and Monks often exhibit the discipline expected of the order’s knights. Bards

  Higher Callings
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1eb1216e-2f99-43a6-aceb-731f349bd1ce">
  When knights of the Order of the Gauntlet speak of a higher calling, they are referring to the
  particular way in which a knight pursues and enforces the Order of the Gauntlet’s creed. Higher
  callings come to knights from divine epiphanies, messages from higher powers, or omens witnessed
  during or after important events.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="173e11c9-1ba4-49b8-9879-7ab8dffa8ebc">
  A knight’s higher calling is summarized in a proverb called the knight’s dictum. For example, a
  knight who strives to dismantle systems of oppression might espouse this dictum: “Disarm those who
  unjustly disarm others.” Knights frequently decorate their weapons or armor with their dictums.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="59060eb7-a9be-41c9-af46-c71e61661e00">
  Even though a knight’s higher calling is usually personal, many knights share higher callings.
  Knights with shared higher callings often congregate at particular chapters of the order.

      The Purple Dragon Knights have protected the kingdom of Cormyr for centuries. But a decade
      ago, the knights underwent a transformation led by the spirit of an ancient amethyst dragon
      named Eldenser. Eldenser was a scholar of the multiverse, and in his travels, he saw people
      partnering with dragons on the world of Krynn. Inspired by what he witnessed, Eldenser called
      other amethyst dragons to Cormyr and persuaded them to partner with the kingdom’s Purple
      Dragon Knights to defend Cormyr while pursuing new knowledge and experiences. Now the knights
      ride amethyst dragons across Faerûn to oppose Cormyr’s enemies, hunt aberrant monsters, and
      carry out the will of Cormyr’s noble queen, Raedra.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b626815-4fac-4e03-8376-361821f8346b">
  The foremost obligation of the Purple Dragon Knights is to protect Cormyr and carry out the wishes
  of its ruler, Queen Raedra. The knights lead Cormyr’s armies, defend its strongholds, and
  represent the crown and Cormyr more broadly across Faerûn. Many travel Faerûn as knights errant,
  assisting people in need and searching for potential squires.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef15e4bd-7ab4-4623-9813-0e735037b697">
  The knights’ amethyst dragon partners have goals of their own. First and foremost, amethyst
  dragons seek out new experiences. Their curiosity prompts them to explore and collect knowledge
  not just on Toril, but throughout the multiverse. They have a special hatred of aberrations and
  lead their knights on quests to hunt and kill such creatures.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eee8447a-e759-47a6-bf48-17bc4d4761fe">
  Together, Purple Dragon Knights and their dragon partners oppose the Cult of the Dragon, rooting
  out and destroying secret cells of the cult whenever possible.

  Leadership and Organization
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c9d32b4-4155-42ac-b72f-8071bee6185c">
  The Purple Dragon Knights have a simple rank structure. The leader of the organization is the
  Grand Knight, currently Dunstan Cormaeril, who has served in this role since the re-formation of
  the Purple Dragon Knights a decade ago. Dunstan is assisted and advised by the spirit of Eldenser,
  whose incorporeal form dwells inside Dunstan’s magic sword. Because Dunstan doesn’t have a living
  amethyst dragon partner, he can’t travel around Faerûn as easily as other knights can, and his
  duties keep him at Purplemont, the knights’ fortress in Suzail.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f7da0a5-9453-4058-8faf-bcb766a542ab">
  The Grand Knight is assisted by a council of twelve High Knights, experienced warriors whose
  loyalty to Cormyr is beyond question. They lead other knights of Cormyr in battle.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6025e32c-c835-4537-917e-81d5214db8c3">
  Most Purple Dragon Knights are simply knights, with no other rank. While knights aspire to become
  High Knights, few ever achieve that rank. Knights might be assigned quests by the Grand Knight or
  the queen, but between missions they live as knights errant. They travel Cormyr or anywhere their
  dragon takes them, pursuing justice for the oppressed, protecting the weak, and furthering the
  goals of Cormyr.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="643823ca-2564-4078-a1fc-a28b1bc06990">
  New knights carry the title of knight novice for a year and a day. During this time, they follow
  the orders of other knights and master the art of riding a dragon. But because the Purple Dragon
  Knights are few, knight novices must often rise to the occasion by undertaking perilous missions
  with only their dragons and fellow adventurers for allies.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5bcaadb3-6774-4de0-9e2a-f0d7ef6713eb">
  Purple Dragon Knights sometimes take squires—aspiring knights who have not yet earned their dragon

  Taking the Purple
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68f5fd5c-f1a5-45bd-b53a-533379bf7614">
  An individual who wants to join the Purple Dragon Knights—or “take the purple,” in Cormyrean
  parlance—must get the attention of a knight and ask to become the knight’s squire. For citizens of
  Cormyr, this is relatively easy; an aspiring squire who goes to Purplemont in Suzail can usually
  attract a knight’s attention in short order. But the legend of the Purple Dragon Knights has
  spread far and wide in recent years, and people from Icewind Dale to Calimshan dream of riding an
  amethyst dragon across Faerûnian skies. For these people, finding a knight can be a significant
  quest.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7870ec43-b5be-4d01-bb2c-e9aea8dd0c57">
  Knights decide who to take as a squire. Most knights expect a squire to demonstrate fighting
  skill, courage, a willingness to follow orders, and a keen sense of right and wrong. More eager
  candidates exist than there are amethyst dragons, so knights select only the best to become
  squires. Since it’s considered bad luck to accept a squire who has already been refused by another
  knight, few aspirants continue their quest for knighthood after facing rejection.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c4d87b68-c4a4-4cf4-a999-8dbca1fd5681">
  Squires usually train for a few years before they’re made a knight, but proving their courage,
  skill, and character in extraordinary circumstances can expedite their knighthood. But before a
  squire can become a Purple Dragon Knight, an amethyst dragon must choose the squire as its rider.
  Not every squire is chosen, and squires passed over by a dragon often get discouraged and quit
  their pursuit of knighthood. Others stick it out, continuing to serve the Purple Dragon Knights as
  squires or administrators in hopes to be chosen as a dragon’s rider one day.

  The Dragon and the Knight
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c242c76c-a077-4199-8c04-d3c586e01976">
  The relationship between a Purple Dragon Knight and an amethyst dragon partner is complicated and
  intense. Amethyst dragons are telepathic; they routinely read their partners’ minds and
  communicate by thought. Every Purple Dragon Knight knows that secrets can’t exist between a dragon
  and its rider if both are to succeed; eventually the pair comes to know everything about each
  other.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b941f7f5-e6a8-44a7-a2f2-2f1994bf5ec6">
  Amethyst dragons are exceptionally powerful. A Purple Dragon Knight is usually far less formidable
  than the dragon they ride. But a dragon’s rider has courage, ambition, and hope—qualities admired
  by amethyst dragons. The best pairings strategically leverage their strengths and weaknesses.
  Against an especially dangerous enemy, a knight is apt to let the dragon take point. When a
  situation calls for diplomacy and a dragon might be seen as a threat, the knight leads.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="81d38ba7-8648-4fb2-8682-602a5aba2c93">
  Purple Dragon Knights make use of their amethyst dragons’ unique powers outside of encounters as
  well. For example, because amethyst dragons can breathe underwater and swim at great speed, many
  knights make temporary camps in undersea grottoes or in hidden pools accessible only by flooded
  tunnels. The Grand Knight even built a secret sanctuary for the knights in the Dragonmere, a small
  sea on Cormyr’s southern coast.

  Dragon Quests
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a60fd3b-d312-464a-9e1b-0902e8a1cce4">
  Before an amethyst dragon accepts a squire as its rider, the dragon sometimes asks the squire to
  undertake a heroic quest. Completion of this quest signals that the squire is worthy of the
  dragon’s respect and ascension to knighthood. Such quests are rarely simple affairs; some amethyst
  dragons, now notorious, have assigned the same quest to many squires who failed—or even died—in
  their attempts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c8246b1-c59d-49e1-a658-7c27c93f8e21">
  An amethyst dragon rarely discloses the quest’s details until after a petitioner has agreed to
  undertake it. What’s more, a squire who’s agreed to undertake an amethyst dragon’s quest can’t
  thereafter accept a different dragon’s quest.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="69b68be4-64e8-4072-a7c7-33430efa31a7">
  Some amethyst dragons offer their quests to non-squires, allowing unaffiliated adventurers a
  chance to join the Purple Dragon Knights without being squires.

    Amethyst dragons are detailed in
    <a href="/sources/dnd/ftod"><em>Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons</em></a
    >, and you can find their stat blocks there along with more information on Eldenser. They are
    the most powerful kind of gem dragon. Whereas chromatic dragons are typically evil, and metallic
    dragons typically good, gem dragons are typically neutral. They have the same age categories as
    other dragons (wyrmling, young, adult, ancient) but their spellcasting powers are psionic in
    nature. The breath weapon of an amethyst dragon is a bead of exploding gravitational force.
    Amethyst dragons can breathe underwater and swim at great speed.

      When folk in Faerûn think of the Red Wizards, most imagine cabals of undead mages clad in
      blood-red robes and wielding unholy arcane powers. According to such tales, these vile
      spellcasters hail from Thay, a hellish nation of paranoid wizard-lords called zulkirs and
      their zombified minions. Red Wizards are universally evil, so the stories go, and should be
      treated as such.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7bfac4d-443e-481e-ad07-a1d4bdf7445a">
      The truth is more nuanced. Magic has restored Thay’s environment, and trade has returned,
      despite the dangers posed by Thay’s powerful undead ruler, Szass Tam. Szass Tam is a
      necromancer and lich who rules through fear and cruelty, but he is only one of eight rival
      zulkirs. These zulkirs—and the Red Wizards they command—can pursue their own interests so long
      as they don’t displease Szass Tam.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cad895be-4b33-4a43-a8d4-d6a0e9a28e01">
  Still, Red Wizards share enough common traits—namely their formidable skill at magic and their
  craving for arcane power—that, despite rivalry among the faction’s leaders, the Red Wizards are
  still a unified group.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="ThayanKnights">
  <p>Thayan Knights</p>
  <p>
    Red Wizards from Thay are often served by one or more Thayan knights—proven warriors whose sworn
    duty is to protect the Red Wizards. Thayan knights resemble Red Wizards in some ways—shaved
    heads, arcane tattoos—but lack the faction’s trademark red robes and favor sword and shield over
    staff and scroll. That said, since knowledge of the arcane arts is often necessary to protect
    their wards, Thayan knights typically boast impressive knowledge of wizardry. Some even wield
    minor forms of magic to augment their martial abilities.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6cdad19-4505-4b7d-9a68-df9ba7ab9479">
  Red Wizards are experts in the arcane arts. Many serve a zulkir, while others travel Faerûn
  gathering magical secrets. Red Wizards often seek ways to extend their lives. In the past,
  necromancy was the go-to solution to the problem of mortality, but lately zulkirs have begun
  seeking other methods, such as pacts with devils or archfey or the use of powerful Artifacts.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8c345a4-676c-4b1f-804f-9adaeaa9cfb3">
  Rivalry between the zulkirs is ubiquitous. Inside Thay, this rivalry is kept out of the public eye
  so that the supremacy of the zulkirs isn’t questioned. But outside Thay, this rivalry frequently
  breaks out into the open, leading to battles between Red Wizards on the streets of settlements
  throughout Faerûn.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ac576a8-bcae-42d6-b2ef-9c3a8a199031">
  Some Red Wizards leave Thay and abandon the dangerous intrigue of their homeland. These Red
  Wizards travel Faerûn seeking magical power and ancient lore—not to bring back to their zulkir
  masters, but for their own benefit. Many of these Red Wizards become magic item brokers, financing
  their travels and arcane research by crafting and magic items.
</p>
<h4

  Demeanor and Disguise
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0b515f8-83bf-44ab-ada1-89af2580c223">
  As their name suggests, Red Wizards wear crimson robes. In Thay, they are the only caste permitted
  to wear this color; the penalty for others doing so is death. Most Red Wizards shave their heads
  and bear prominent arcane tattoos on their face or scalp. Red Wizards might wear silver, steel, or
  silken accessories, but they aren’t ostentatious, nor are they spiritual or overly concerned with
  traditions or rites. To the Red Wizards, arcane power is everything—more important than all the
  gold, gods, or glory in the multiverse.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="589d0d28-99ce-4268-bed7-0057ee3902ac">
  The reputation of a Red Wizard precedes them, and this can create difficulties for Red Wizards who
  leave Thay to pursue personal goals or simply carry out instructions from the zulkirs. When Red
  Wizards leave Thay, they often conceal their identities to avoid persecution. Red Wizards’ skill
  at magic makes this a simple matter; unknown numbers of Red Wizards walk in plain clothes,
  shrouded by illusion, in every major cosmopolitan area of the Forgotten Realms.

  Traveling and Trade
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5beedaab-e461-43b3-90d2-614447f72c85">
  Many Red Wizards travel in groups so they can complement one another’s different specialties;
  since Szass Tam’s fall, the eight magic schools have become evenly represented among them.
  Traveling together also enables Red Wizards to practice circle magic (see
  <a
    href="/sources/dnd/frhof/magic-of-faerun#CircleMagic"
    data-content-chunk-id="50b1d1bd-c27e-4f9b-a84f-4a214496d7e0"

  >).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ebf63817-58b8-4a77-97ca-400c23893ccc">
  To fund their adventures, many Red Wizards trade in magic items, as well as traditional goods like
  silver and silk. In many parts of the world, Red Wizards are well known for their ruthlessness in
  commerce—and, in some cases, their predilection for spell-assisted deception. Common traders
  exercise great caution when dealing with Red Wizards.

<p data-content-chunk-id="2ab453af-d280-47f4-93aa-ec214c86d99c">
  Most Red Wizards hail from Thay and serve that nation’s zulkirs—a council of the eight most
  powerful Red Wizards, one for each school of magic. Szass Tam seldom leaves the Citadel, his most
  formidable fortress on the slopes of Thaymount. The other zulkirs scheme against each other,
  pursue personal goals, and relish their lofty positions as corulers of Thay.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8bcf6fa5-2acd-49a5-b61a-ffa42c73bfee">
  Beyond the zulkirs, Red Wizards have no official ranks or hierarchy. Unofficially, Red Wizards are
  sometimes given one of three titles—apprentice, master, or sage—that reflect magical prowess and
  respect among other Red Wizards. Apprentices are expected to blend into the background of Red
  Wizard meetings until they’ve proved themselves worthy of speaking. Sages are the Red Wizards’
  eldest, most accomplished arcanists, responsible for training apprentices and rearing future
  generations of Red Wizards. Masters fall between apprentices and sages and are the majority of Red
  Wizards.

  Thayan Enclaves
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="544024cb-a5f4-4cca-8255-4d68dd46869a">
  Over the last two centuries, Thayan wizards and merchants worked together to established
  enclaves—small communities of Red Wizards who traded in magic items and spells—across Faerûn.
  Governments permitted these enclaves within their borders because they resulted in lucrative
  trade. According to the charters of the Thayan enclaves, the land within the walls of an enclave
  is Thayan soil, and Thayan law applies there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="92a59c89-3d08-4784-8f1e-2d0503918221">
  Over the years, many enclaves were besieged or abandoned. But others survived through skillful
  negotiation on the part of the Red Wizards who lived there or simply because they were far enough
  away from Thay that even Szass Tam’s onerous reputation meant little. A few converted to illicit
  markets hidden among the mundane trade of the local settlement.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="64f4c17d-1c35-4312-8273-ab28843e0b4f">
  But the old charters are still legally binding, and with a little persuasion, some concessions,
  and gifts of powerful magic items to the right rulers, Thayan enclaves are reopening in
  settlements across Faerûn. The typical Thayan enclave is walled and houses a handful of Red
  Wizards, their bodyguards, a garrison of soldiers to defend the enclave and project power into the
  nearby settlement, and a flourishing market for magic items. Profits generated by these enclaves
  go back to Thay to fuel the reconstruction of the nation.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="59fc09a8-a2e2-43a6-ab7c-ee534fcca469">
  For anyone who seeks an audience with the Red Wizards—or who aspires to become one—the first step
  is to seek out the nearest Thayan enclave.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ec980db1-fc6e-4b36-9e02-ddc32668fb0b">
  Red Wizards who take up the adventuring life serve Szass Tam or one of the other zulkirs. When not
  carrying out a superior’s instructions, a Red Wizard seeks magical power and explores Faerûn for
  secrets and lore.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4678b334-1d15-4b5a-87a6-75fdcb1d8658">
  The archetypal Red Wizard is driven by ambition. They are loyal to friends, proven allies, and
  Thay itself. Altruism is a rare virtue among the Red Wizards, but it shines all the more brightly
  for that rarity. Most Red Wizard characters are Wizards. Rarely, Warlocks and Sorcerers find their
  way to the order.

  This magical tattoo contains the essence of a level 1–3 spell chosen by the tattoo’s creator.
  While the tattoo is on your body, you always have the associated spell prepared, and you can cast
  the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. If you have the Spellcasting or
  Pact Magic feature, the spell uses your spellcasting ability; otherwise, if the spell requires a
  saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 13 and the attack bonus is +5. If your
  Attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes.

  <p>Inking Thayan Spell Tattoos</p>
  <p>
    The Thayan art of magical tattooing is highly guarded by its practitioners, and thus,
    [magicitems]Thayan Spell Tattoo;Thayan Spell Tattoos[/magicitems] can’t be crafted like other
    magic items. To learn how to ink <em>Thayan Spell Tattoos</em>, you must have a Renown Score of
    50+ with the Red Wizards.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ink a <em>Thayan Spell Tattoo</em>, you must have proficiency in the [skill]Arcana[/skill]
    skill and with Calligrapher’s Tools and have the spell prepared each day of the inking. You must
    also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its
    Material components, they are consumed when you complete the tattoo. Inking a
    <em>Thayan Spell Tattoo</em> takes the same amount of time and money as scribing a
    [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of an equivalent level.

      The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants,
      mercenaries, and malefactors. When a caravan needs escorts, a noble needs bodyguards, or a
      city needs soldiers, the Zhentarim provides the best-trained fighting forces money can buy. If
      the cargo is shady or the cause is questionable, the Zhentarim doesn’t mind one bit—if there’s
      money to be made, Zhents will dabble in just about any venture.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1d65e46c-b108-4234-9ac2-611baa965db6">
      Zhentarim agents consider themselves part of an extended family, and membership in the
      organization comes with the perks—and tension—that familial relations imply. Resources and
      security are shared among the organization, but the Zhentarim recognizes and rewards personal
      ambition, granting its members autonomy to pursue their own interests. In this way, the
      organization is a meritocracy; those who do well for themselves do well in the Zhentarim at
      large. But woe be to any whose personal aims conflict with the Zhentarim’s, for loyalists
      respond to treachery with fierce retribution.

  The Zhentarim welcomes all whose primary motivator is money. This mindset has earned the
  organization a negative reputation among Faerûn’s other factions. Harpers in particular have
  historically clashed with Zhents, and members of the Lords’ Alliance and Order of the Gauntlet
  keep a close eye on the organization’s effects on Faerûnian politics. At an individual level,
  however, adventurers have little to fear from Zhentarim allies on assignment—they just make sure
  to read the fine print before signing any Zhentarim contracts.

  Goals and Activities
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3c3d4de-9e87-49c8-ac22-3c0dc23669c0">
  The Zhentarim’s public-facing philosophy is one of ruthless enterprise. According to Zhentarim
  doctrine, money left on the table benefits no one and only wastes precious resources. By this
  logic, the faction’s activities are altruistic. No laws are being broken, after all; the laws are
  simply being used to their fullest potential.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04691128-08a1-49ef-b4e3-9edc7e7d0ec3">
  In actuality, the Zhentarim has its fingers in many illegal industries and unsavory ventures,
  ranging from racketeering, intimidation, and smuggling to grand larceny, assassinations, and
  warmongering. Zhentarim veterans may go deep undercover for months at a time, disrupting
  well-established local power structures, or leading task forces of lower-ranking agents into
  volatile situations.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a96dec6-7829-43a9-bcf4-7295ee3e7447">
  In places where laws prove too restrictive for the Zhentarim to achieve its fiscal goals, it pulls
  strings to change those laws. In some parts of Faerûn, the Zhentarim effectively isthe authority,
  having rewritten the legal code to suit its own ends. Such is the case in many districts of cities
  like Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate as well as the Zhentarim’s de facto headquarters in Darkhold.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c689db83-8dbf-486b-bb0e-b146b00cb49f">
  The Zhentarim’s ultimate aims are unknown. The most common theory is the Zhentarim wants to
  monopolize trade protection and become the richest organization in Faerûn. If merchants were ever
  wholly reliant on Zhentarim transport, the Zhentarim would control commerce across the entire
  globe. But no one knows what the Zhentarim would do with such power once the faction had it.

  Ties to Evil Deities
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4b0546a-1edc-44b8-961e-b885ef90cdac">
  The Zhentarim has a long history of involvement with two deities: Bane and Cyric. Presently the
  organization has no official affiliation with any god, but these deities still find many devotees
  among
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="063fef38-c244-45c3-9b05-287b65c1b154">
  the Zhentarim. Bane’s ethos of domination over the weak is a natural complement to the ambitions
  of power-hungry Zhents, whereas Cyric’s cunning and ruthlessness are admirable traits in Zhentarim
  circles.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db8d78bf-6824-4947-9ba8-f92af4cbc588">
  Nowadays, religious Zhents are more likely to consort with diabolic divinities than world-famous
  gods. The Lords of the Nine boast countless patrons who can advance a mortal’s social standing or
  wealth, and many Zhents beseech such powers. Some of the Zhentarim’s most popular infernal
  sponsors include Mammon (the Nine Hells’ principal miser), Fierna (coruler of Phlegethos with her
  father, Belial), and Glasya (Asmodeus’s daughter).

  Leadership and Organization

<p data-content-chunk-id="ef0adf0c-e273-4561-b8ff-27477b236108">
  The Zhentarim is based foremost out of Darkhold, a citadel in the western Heartlands. Darkhold
  Vale has a small militia that answers to a local captain named Sulvarn. But the true leader of the
  castle—and the entire Zhentarim organization—is the legendary Pereghost: a dark knight credited
  with leading the Zhentarim toward its current prosperity. No one knows the Pereghost’s identity or
  whether he is even a single person; he’s never been seen without his black iron armor and
  face-covering helm, and he’s led the Zhentarim for over a hundred years.

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="FiveThingsEveryoneKnowsabouttheZhentarim">
  <p>Five Things Everyone Knows about the Zhentarim</p>
  <p>Anyone in Faerûn who didn’t grow up under a rock knows the following about the Zhentarim:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want to move something unnoticed, hire Zhentarim mercenaries.</li>
    <li>
      The Zhentarim considers itself one big family. If you cross one Zhent, you cross them all.
    </li>
    <li>When trying to make an impression on a Zhent, a little coin goes a long way.</li>
    <li>
      Zhents take great pride in their weapons and armor, which are often embellished with special
      insignias.
    </li>
    <li>Zhentarim brokers are legal experts. Don’t try to swindle a Zhent.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c55abd44-c22a-4946-85ff-52eb0de19341">
  The Zhentarim famously conducts itself like a family. Some members take this to heart by assuming
  epithets like uncle, mother, or cousin. But the Zhentarim’s official titles are far more sinister
  sounding. In order of lowest to highest rank, titles range from primal animal parts (such as fang)
  to the names of predators (wolf, viper) to original monikers of Zhentarim design (ardragon, dread
  lord).

</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55b24532-828d-45f7-98fe-a3844c04d05d">
  Although the Zhentarim’s center of power is in Darkhold, the organization maintains outposts in
  virtually every region where there’s money to be made. Whether Zhents are manipulating the
  knucklehead trout trade of Icewind Dale, inflating the price of sunmelons in the Dalelands, or
  hunting rare dinosaur pelts in Chult, they rely on Zhentarim outposts to relay news, refresh
  supplies, and relax after a successful job.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ad413e96-f74f-4b20-8e0b-951c6ec2eeb7">
  Many Zhentarim outposts are secret—unassuming locales such as abandoned warehouses and crumbling
  tenements that keep illegal doings hidden from public notice. Other outposts are ostentatious and
  richly appointed: handsome manors, lavish villas, and well-outfitted guild houses that loudly
  advertise the organization’s services and reputation for success.

  Adventurers of every stripe can excel in the Zhentarim. Fighter, Monk, and Rogue are good choices
  for a rank-and-file Zhentarim mercenary. Wizards, Warlocks, and Bards are well suited to the
  skilled work and high-level deals required to make it in the organization’s upper echelons.

  The fewer scruples a character has the better; lawful and good-aligned characters won’t be
  comfortable doing the Zhentarim’s ethically dubious work. When it comes to background, many Zhents
  trace their origins to prior work as a Criminal, Merchant, or Soldier.

  Zhentarim Insignias
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f670d332-642c-49fe-9345-c4108a24c09a">
  Zhents take great pride in their tools of the trade. Many Zhents decorate their cherished weapons
  and armor with ornamental accessories, decorative etchings, and other custom flourishes.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fba63735-0ed9-46ed-bda3-59a1dfac32ce">
  Zhentarim artisans craft and apply specific motifs called Zhentarim insignias. These insignias,
  which must be authorized by a senior Zhent of rank viper or higher, recognize the recipient’s good
  work, notable exploits, or continued loyalty. Zhents wear their insignias on their gear with great
  pride, much as soldiers wear badges of honor.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d61740d-9211-47cd-b45c-a881b1343e34">
  Only Zhentarim-affiliated artisans are permitted to apply an insignia; counterfeiters are rooted
  out and punished.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b4950a1-1e7b-4772-baad-6652c43bc9d7">
  Work with your DM to determine what, if any, insignia your Zhentarim character has. The most
  common Zhentarim insignia is of a downward-flying dragon chasing an orb on a field of flames,
  which signifies an individual has completed their first successful job for the Zhentarim. Later,
  this initial design could be augmented with insignias that signify important deeds or special
  honors. For example, additional orbs usually signify the accumulation of wealth, and the number of
  flames on the field of fire signify lives taken during Zhentarim jobs.

  Criminal Syndicates
</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a850f93-eb14-43cc-9cfe-c5708af47294">
  Thieves’ guilds, crime rings, and outwardly lawless factions are common in Faerûn. While some are
  so local in scale, short lived, or disorganized that they’re little more than common gangs,
  others—such as the Shadow Thieves of Amn or the Fire Knives of Westgate—enforce their edicts on
  monarchs and lords through intimidation, terror, and outright murder. Adventurers, justice
  seekers, and potential rivals (or accomplices) do well to keep tabs on these criminal
  organizations.
</p>

  Fire Knives
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4075995-7c99-489d-aa5c-dfedf7ea80c7">
  The Fire Knives is a syndicate of noble-born assassins, extortionists, enforcers, and spies based
  out of Westgate. The syndicate is run by the city’s ruling family, House Bleth, blurring the line
  between law and crime there.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fb1295e-6915-4034-bd8f-d6ad5ee3a9be">
  Originally based out of Cormyr, the Fire Knives traces its roots to two disgraced noble families
  from that nation: House Bleth and House Cormaeril. Most Fire Knives are born into the organization
  from these families, though the syndicate occasionally recruits outsiders. Anyone who wants to
  influence Westgate society benefits from a good relationship with the Fire Knives.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c31f58ef-09d8-4693-b82a-6bcfa13c1db5">
  Members of the Fire Knives take advantage of their noble bloodlines and aristocratic training to
  move freely within high society and get close to their favored targets: Cormyrean
  nobles—particularly House Obarskyr. Only the syndicate’s leader, the Grandmother of Assassins,
  knows the true reasons behind the Fire Knives’ bloodthirsty schemes.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b591698-6f9b-4d54-8331-81fbe17f7edf">
  Fire Knives agents work alone on assassinations, though they sometimes use accomplices to help
  them set up the killing and escape safely afterward. Most prefer poisoned blades—daggers,
  stilettos, or the like—to accomplish their deeds, using aristocratic wiles or clever disguises to
  get close to a target before eliminating them. When necessary, an agent slips a toxin into the
  target’s food or drink instead. The Fire Knives disdain what they consider “brutish” weapons, such
  as garrotes and crossbows.

  Nine Golden Swords
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb7742dc-a079-433f-a9fb-5eaac19049ec">
  The Nine Golden Swords is a powerful crime syndicate based out of Thesk in northeast Faerûn. From
  there, the Swords’ power extends eastward along the Golden Way, the legendary trade route between
  Faerûn and lands to the east, as well as westward around the Sea of Fallen Stars, where cells
  operate in port cities like Telflamm and Westgate. The Nine Golden Swords’ operations include
  highway robbery, intimidation, and peddling vices in dens of iniquity. The leader of the Nine
  Golden Swords is a mysterious figure known as the Golden Throne.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40de5d95-4d3b-4602-9a39-c6269ba5fcd2">
  The Nine Golden Swords has a strong foothold in Westgate, where they’re based out of the city’s
  Shou District. The syndicate opposes the ruling Fire Knives and claims to be an organization of
  the people, though most recognize it’s a criminal enterprise. Still, the Nine Golden Swords has
  publicly opposed the Fire Knives’ worst affronts against those too weak to defend themselves.
  Consequently, the Nine Golden Swords enjoys the favor of the working class.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b7ddfe53-00c4-4979-84f3-2d23cd68651f">
  Punishment, rather than reward, is the typical tool of control within the Nine Golden Swords.
  Members are referred to as soldiers and are treated as an elite military order, with defection
  punished by death. Conversely, a soldier’s loyalty might be rewarded in time, but advancement
  isn’t guaranteed. The hierarchy of the Nine Golden Swords is opaque, even to those inside the
  organization.

  Shadow Thieves
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a104f2dd-0c89-40f0-92f2-5cae7af4bc02">
  The Shadow Thieves is the largest and most prosperous thieves’ guild in Faerûn. Its goals are
  simple—accumulate wealth and acquire power—and thus appeal to aspiring crooks and cons the world
  over.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7f17b33-546a-4ceb-a811-596b626c41b8">
  The Shadow Thieves is based out of the nation of Amn, where it controls markets as well as
  politics and is even secretly supported by that nation’s ruling Council of Six. The Shadow Thieves
  once controlled the criminal underworld of Waterdeep, to the north; the guild’s leaders have
  nursed a grudge against the city and its rulers ever since their exile.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef63e635-7755-414a-9898-faa7c11953d0">
  The Shadow Thieves’ influence is felt far and wide. According to common wisdom, the Shadow Thieves
  has a hand in everything that happens along the Sword Coast. Savvy merchants and aristocrats alike
  recognize the folly of ignoring the guild, so individuals of means make allies among the Shadow
  Thieves, or at least stay apprised of the faction’s activities.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45e3071b-3b2e-4687-9a40-6b30da9f71fc">
  The Shadow Thieves’ success is derived from its complex hierarchy, which is organized into layers
  like an onion. At the center of the guild is the Shadow Council, led by the Grandmaster of Shadow.
  Reporting to the council are senior administrators called cloakmasters, who are in turn served by
  the guildmasters and the guild’s countless rank-and-file operatives. Situated at each level of
  this hierarchy are arrays of blinds—stool pigeons with false titles who operate out of decoy
  hideouts and whose purpose is to throw off the Shadow Thieves’ enemies.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b8703fc-b46a-4f17-8243-32d8cdf81269">
  Joining the Shadow Thieves isn’t difficult, and recruits who survive their first few missions can
  quickly climb the guild’s ranks. Guildmasters have autonomy to recruit and promote within the
  local guild level.

</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22129a15-fa75-48e4-a755-e68f76081438">
  The Xanathar Guild is, despite its name, a criminal organization in Waterdeep with no official
  guild status. Anyone is welcome to join, and many runaways, street urchins, and common ruffians
  seek admittance to the Xanathar Guild in hopes of improving their poor lot. Before membership is
  granted, however, an applicant must pass a test that always involves committing a serious crime.
  Possibilities include murdering a guild member who has failed Xanathar in some fashion, kidnapping
  a Waterdhavian citizen, collecting a ransom, robbing a coach, or looting a warehouse.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52923923-579e-4b29-82b3-6f2820afc6dc">
  Among low-ranking guild members, rampant speculation goes on about the true nature of Xanathar.
  Some say Xanathar is a beholder or another monster, perhaps an unusually patient minotaur or
  magically enlightened ogre, while others insist that the name belongs to a human who uses illusion
  magic to appear like a monster. Still others contend that Xanathar isn’t an individual but rather
  a metaphor for a set of villainous ideals. (Intellectualism is held in low esteem in the Xanathar
  Guild, even by the standards of criminal gangs, so that last theory is scorned by guild members.)
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="971c6327-e77d-4680-b6c3-da2bbd1e9458">
  Advancement in the guild is fiercely competitive and based on a member’s wiles or their ability to
  dispose of rivals. Evil adventurers can thrive in this environment, but the risks are seldom worth
  the reward.

<p data-content-chunk-id="dd46b76c-d1e0-4e04-a2a7-cfab86c6f0d3">
  The Arcane Brotherhood is a cabal of powerful wizards that operates out of the Hosttower of the
  Arcane, a multispired structure that towers above the city of Luskan on the Sword Coast. The
  group’s leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring
  wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the
  Hosttower in hopes of gaining admittance to the brotherhood’s prestigious ranks. Nearly all
  candidates are dismissed out of hand without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the group’s
  leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent.
  Yet prospective wizards are willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the
  brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower’s incredible libraries of magical lore.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c1263261-4d65-4317-a760-df66b5aa8ad6">
  Once welcomed into the organization, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as
  they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not
  rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood are rivals to one another,
  striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members
  are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.

  Aurora’s Emporium sells unusual and luxury goods in cities across Faerûn. Clients order items out
  of a detailed catalog, then pick up their purchases at any of the Emporium’s many convenient
  locations. Purchases can also be delivered by special request. Among the catalog’s unique array of
  offerings are useful adventuring gear; specialty curiosities; and staples such as wine, bread, and
  a dozen varieties of cheese.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8c396ae-9dad-4c10-85e4-ed948e127836">
  The Emporium’s goals are threefold: acquire quality goods, make these goods available to
  interested parties at a reasonable profit, and uphold the name of Aurora’s Emporium as an
  honorable business with satisfied customers.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e0ae0f3-0cf5-4175-bbe7-a6703df3e226">
  The business’s namesake is Aurora, a former adventurer whose mission in retirement was offering
  the kinds of gear and supplies she wished she’d been able to purchase in her heyday. Because she
  was an adventurer herself, Aurora understood the importance of procuring reliable, quality
  merchandise, so she provided the best products and service money could buy. She became a legend in
  the adventuring community but passed many years ago after a long and happy life. Now the business
  is run by her great-granddaughter, also named Aurora, who employs storekeepers and mages to
  conduct day-to-day sales operations, and adventurers to procure new and interesting items for
  sale.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="58654ee5-5b61-49d8-87ea-80c8535a51d9">
  The first Emporium storefront opened in Waterdeep, and the enterprise has since spread throughout
  Faerûn. The Emporium now consists of dozens of shops and warehouses in locales both populous and
  remote. Emporium workers use magic to transport goods to stores—a practice that keeps valuable
  items from becoming targets for thieves.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5c8f1c3-91bf-4623-aab2-14960261cb5e">
  One of Aurora’s most popular offerings is the cheese bag: a pound of cheese randomly selected from
  a dozen different varieties from around Faerûn. According to the posters on many of Aurora’s
  Emporiums, the cheese bag is the “Best Cheese Deal on the Material Plane.” One cheese bag costs 1
  GP, and sales are limited to one per person per day. When a character buys a cheese bag, roll on
  the Cheese Bag Contents table to determine the kind of cheese therein.

  Elemental Cults
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa2eebae-ed23-4999-918c-4e754535fc6d">
  Four cults of evil doomsayers scattered across Faerûn (and, indeed, the entire multiverse) are
  collectively known as the elemental cults. These cults are ancient and appear on every world.
  Whenever and wherever the cults manifest, heroes or gods usually seek to destroy them in due
  order. But the elemental cults never truly die, eventually returning in some fashion.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="708fd86d-ea03-4289-b903-8ea92dfdb118">
  The elemental cults venerate a mysterious force or principle called Elemental Evil. Each cult
  worships Elemental Evil in its own way, favoring one of the four primordial elements: air, earth,
  fire, or water. The cults operate independently from one another, and each believes itself
  superior to the others.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Air" data-content-chunk-id="a933a15f-06c2-46aa-aaef-457becceb9d0">
  Air
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0ac3dd6-4265-430a-9d43-84266b36d537">
  Cultists of the Howling Hatred venerate the element of air. To them, powerful winds are the
  ultimate expression of power. Air cultists are among the most vengeful and petty members of the
  elemental cults, seeing slights in every social encounter and brooding on ways to get back at
  their rivals. The cult’s numbers frequently include assassins, illusionists, and spies.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Earth" data-content-chunk-id="b092237a-4ebf-4c79-9871-2df1fb9e1319">
  Earth
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b73d0039-7d6b-4e7f-b6f5-38790f902490">
  The Cult of the Black Earth aims to destroy civilization by exerting the inexorable power of the
  land. Earth cultists conduct rituals to bring about mudslides, sinkholes, and earthquakes in the
  effort to wipe the world clean of those who defile it. This cult counts miners and quarry workers
  among its enemies and burrowing beasts like ankhegs and bulettes among its allies.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Fire" data-content-chunk-id="5f758e95-0b6d-464e-9332-92bb9ed44042">
  Fire
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="11420bf4-5f41-4b60-84c0-d5f740a02f96">
  The followers of the Eternal Flame cult worship the destructive power of fire in all its
  manifestations. Their ideal world is a wasteland of ash and cinders—a world purified by flames.
  Fire cultists tend to be reckless and brash. They launch themselves into dangerous situations with
  no regard for their own safety, seeking only to inflict as much damage as possible. To fire
  cultists, it is better to burn brightly and briefly than to live a long life of mediocrity.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Water" data-content-chunk-id="37f13e38-a72c-46cd-b2f2-52f4adc8a736">
  Water
</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="198ad205-e783-436b-b4fd-635618e24c02">
  Cultists of the Crushing Wave believe that all life is simply water waiting to be set free by way
  of bloodshed, drowning, or pulverizing pressure. Members of this cult are opportunistic and
  pragmatic, exploiting enemies’ weaknesses whenever possible. They seek out wealth and magic items
  to advance their schemes. Among those who hear the call of Elemental Evil, fishers, sailors, and
  others who feel at home on water are typically drawn to this cult.

  Flaming Fist
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fc6731cb-1d62-4539-be78-5577d219db18">
  The Flaming Fist is a mercenary company based in Baldur’s Gate. It is led by the city’s grand
  duke, Ulder Ravengard. Although the Watch is the city’s official constabulary, the Flaming Fist is
  its true peacekeeping force. The mercenaries’ red and gold colors are so ubiquitous in Baldur’s
  Gate that they are commonly associated with the city itself.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a89fdd79-f3e6-4892-b0ab-6a9fba294b5d">
  Membership in the Flaming Fist is easy to achieve. The company offers employment and a sense of
  belonging to any who can lift a sword and follow orders, regardless of their origins. Thousands of
  soldiers current serve in Baldur’s Gate proper, at the Fortress of Wyrm’s Rock on the Chionthar
  River, and at remote outposts such as Fort Beluarian in Chult.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f26a418d-94df-435f-b99c-2881d2768301">
  Experienced adventurers swiftly advance in rank (and political influence) once they become
  members. Many ranking officers are former adventurers who have “retired” to the company.

  Kraken Society
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c525c32-e5ba-41b8-b0f3-123656af466d">
  The Kraken Society is made up of seafarers and land dwellers alike who advance the cause of their
  patron, an enigmatic entity that dwells at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. They traffic in
  information and commit all manner of atrocities along the Sword Coast and throughout the Trackless
  Sea’s islands in pursuit of their mysterious goals. Norlanders and other sailors of the Trackless
  Sea whisper the name Slarkrethel, a monstrous squid some call the King of the Trackless Depths,
  though just as many dismiss the creature as a mere fable.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c663e26-3f85-47d8-b682-9c5d06db2a6a">
  Members of the Kraken Society are called Krakenar. To Krakenar, information is power, and this
  tenet guides their actions. Information can be sold to enrich the group’s coffers or wielded as a
  weapon against the society’s enemies. The right words whispered in the right ears can deliver
  great fortunes to society leaders—countless merchant ships, for instance, have sunk to the floor
  of the Trackless Sea as a result of Krakenar meddling.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7919412-453f-4392-92dc-9669ae8332e4">
  Krakenar who accrue and disseminate information quickly are apt to climb the faction’s ranks.
  Skilled diviners and spies make up most of the Kraken Society’s upper echelons. Beyond information
  gathering, Krakenar conduct assassinations, kidnappings, torture, and other violence.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80a51249-d652-4e35-832d-3fc5515bf034">
  Most Krakenar join the Kraken Society with the sole aim of advancing their own personal power and
  wealth. But the watchful eye of Slarkrethel and the strict discipline enforced by the kraken’s
  senior followers both ensure that Krakenar keep the Kraken Society’s interests at top of mind.

  Order of Delvers
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16a2c39c-1f0b-4636-84ae-84a04e9853a4">
  The Order of Delvers is an explorers’ guild dedicated to exploring and mapping Faerûn’s vast
  subterranean underbelly. Guild members are called delvers, and chapter leaders are called
  delvemasters. The guild promotes the exploration of cave systems, natural tunnels, and the
  uppermost levels of the Underdark.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7662c1e-11cf-4490-9a3e-1175b9f42cdf">
  The Order of Delvers was originally founded by a devout dwarf explorer who sought to locate the
  mythical Soulforge—the hearth where, according to dwarven mythology, Moradin the All-Father
  created the first dwarves. The order has since expanded into a spelunking guild with chapters in
  dwarfholds throughout Faerûn. Many delvers are dwarves devoted to traditional dwarven religious
  beliefs, but anyone with an adventurous spirit and an appetite for discovery is welcome to join.

<p data-content-chunk-id="18b3a484-e2c2-499c-87fd-9a6260f0068c">
  A member must pay regular dues to remain in the order. Delvers enjoy a variety of benefits,
  including the following.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f441bf0-ae5b-4411-bf8f-1438cf1a1269">
  <strong><em>Discounted Supplies.</em></strong> Delvers receive discounts on equipment and services

  <strong><em>Recovery Services.</em></strong> In the event of a catastrophic mishap, the Order of
  Delvers can be hired to send a team of highly trained delvers to locate and recover a delver’s
  belongings (and, if necessary, their corpse).
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5effae1-5b22-4ec0-951e-0edfdcd13ff9">
  <strong><em>Special Equipment.</em></strong> The Order of Delvers commissions a variety of magic

  Spellguard
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="696e5997-b210-4adc-ab64-f9dba53f0f7e">
  The Spellguard is an order of militaristic mages based out of Silverymoon. Originally founded as
  the royal guard of Silverymoon’s then-ruler, Alustriel Silverhand, the Spellguard’s duties soon
  expanded to include the protection of the whole city. During times of peace, members of the
  Spellguard patrol Silverymoon’s borders and monitor the roads between Silverymoon and its allied
  cities. Though most Spellguards remain close to Silverymoon in case of emergency, elite
  Spellguards are assigned to special missions in distant lands and even other parts of the
  multiverse.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5386cc37-4d21-40a1-84b0-026cc51f2749">
  The responsibilities of the Spellguard are too grave to entrust to a novice. To join this elite
  order, an individual must prove their prowess in battle magic, including creating and dispelling
  magical wards, scrying enemies’ positions and intentions, and launching effective magical
  assaults. Many young mages strive to join the Spellguard both out of pride for their city and to
  enjoy the prestige and perks that accompany the station.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0754a7aa-443e-4566-895a-3c16144501ca">
  In time, the order’s most experienced veterans can rise to the position of warder. Warders are
  responsible for testing and training new recruits and spend most of their time in and around
  Silverymoon’s High Palace.

  Waterclock Guild
</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4df1acc9-cde6-468e-9179-75653d75fdc6">
  The Waterclock Guild was a group of artificers, geomancers, and artisans based out of Neverwinter.
  The guild’s members were responsible for crafting that city’s once-famous waterclocks: beautiful,
  incredibly accurate timekeeping devices powered by the flow of water and—unknown to many—elemental
  magic.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c72210f-d505-4a99-b09e-0a71425b6d9f">
  Although the guild proper ceased operation long ago, vestiges of its works still litter forgotten
  crypts and abandoned ruins in Neverwinter. Recently, traveling gnome and dwarf crafters arrived in
  Neverwinter in search of the Waterclock Guild’s lost inventions. These crafters claimed to be
  guild members returning from a centuries-long sojourn, and they sought to recover their fellows’
  relics so they could restore the guild and continue its work. Their labor is still underway, but
  the project, now known as the Waterclock Renaissance, seems destined for success.
</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b1a3962-dec9-4c10-9ca3-b39a17d17c92">
  The leaders of the Waterclock Renaissance are eager to bolster their numbers. Even novice
  clockmakers are being considered for positions in the small organization, as are woodworkers,
  metallurgists, and spellcasters with an aptitude for the craft and maintenance of clocks.
