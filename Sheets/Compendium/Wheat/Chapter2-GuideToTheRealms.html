<p>
  The continent of Faerûn stretches between the <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a> to the
  west and the Sunrise Mountains to the east on a world called Toril. A place of varied cultures and
  peoples, Faerûn contains diverse realms, including kingdoms, city-states, and carefully maintained
  alliances of rural communities. While many of these realms are ruled by humans, who are the most
  populous species in Faerûn today, people of all sorts—including dragonborn, goliaths, orcs,
  tieflings, and more— mingle in those realms, as well as mountainous dwarven kingdoms, hidden elven
  enclaves, and other communities. Except in the most remote or insular places, Faerûnians are
  accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and species.
</p>
<p>
  A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms. The routes between cities and nations often
  cross into the territory of brigands or marauding monsters. Every forest, swamp, and mountain
  range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, malicious fey, or mighty creatures such as
  giants and dragons. Ruins of ancient, forgotten realms dot the landscape, and these ruins often
  conceal expansive subterranean dungeons that wind beneath the surface. In these places, long-lost
  treasures await intrepid adventurers.
</p>
<p>
  Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but day-to-day life
  in Faerûn is that of a medieval society. Rural farmers grow food and herd livestock that gets sent
  to market in towns and cities, where crafters and other tradesfolk gather. News and gossip are
  carried by caravans, ships, and traveling minstrels. Adventurers also spread news—when they’re not
  creating it!
</p>
<p>
  Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn.
  Only the more educated or well traveled among the populace are aware that Faerûn is but one
  continent and that Toril is the whole of the world. For most, “Faerûn” is quite large enough.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="TimeInTheRealms">Time in the Realms</h2>
<p>
  Although a number of means exist for marking the days and the passage of time during a year,
  nearly all folk in Faerûn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos.
</p>
<p>
  In the Calendar of Harptos, a year on Toril consists of 365 days, divided into twelve months of
  thirty days, loosely following the cycle of Selûne, the moon. A month is made up of three tendays,
  also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling between the months, complete the calendar. Once
  every four years, Shieldmeet occurs as a leap day following Midsummer.
</p>
<p>
  Individual days of a tenday have no special names. Instead, they are denoted by counting from the
  beginning of the period (“first day,” “second day,” and so on). Days of the month are designated
  by a number and the month name (for example, “1 Mirtul” or “27 Uktar”). People might also refer to
  a given day by its relationship to the current date (“two tendays from today”) or the nearest
  holiday (“three days past Greengrass”).

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="SpecialCalendarDays">Special Calendar Days</h3>
<p>
  Every realm, faith, and culture across Faerûn has its own special festivals and holidays, the
  observances of which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, the stars, or some other
  event. In addition, the Calendar of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the changing
  of the seasons and one quadrennial festival that are observed in almost every land, with
  particular celebrations varying based on local traditions and popular faiths.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Midwinter">Midwinter</h4>
<p>
  The first festival day of the year is Midwinter, though some people name it differently. Nobles
  and monarchs of the <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a> call it the High Festival of Winter, a
  day to commemorate or renew alliances. Commoners in <a href="#TheNorth">the North</a>,
  <a href="#TheMoonsea">the Moonsea</a>, and other colder climes celebrate it as Deadwinter Day, the
  midpoint of the cold season, with some of the worst days now past.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Greengrass">Greengrass</h4>
<p>
  The traditional spring festival, Greengrass is celebrated with freshly cut flowers (grown in
  special hothouses where necessary) given as gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes
  of a bountiful growing season.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Midsummer">Midsummer</h4>
<p>
  The midpoint of summer is a day of feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the pleasant
  weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes
  interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances begun or marriages promised that day.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Shieldmeet">Shieldmeet</h4>
<p>
  The great holiday of the Calendar of Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years immediately
  after Midsummer. It is a day for plain speaking and open council between rulers and their
  subjects, renewing pacts and contracts, and forging treaties. Many tournaments and contests of
  skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key
  tenets. The next Shieldmeet will be in 1504 DR (see the “<a href="#RealmsTimeline"
    >Realms Timeline</a
  >” sidebar).
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Highharvestide">Highharvestide</h4>
<p>
  A day of feasting and thanks, Highharvestide marks the fall harvest. Most people give thanks to
  Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty before winter approaches. Many who make their living
  by traveling long distances by road or sea set out immediately following the holiday, before
  winter blocks mountain passes and harbors.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="FeastoftheMoon">Feast of the Moon</h4>
<p>
  As nights lengthen and winter winds approach, the Feast of the Moon is the time when people
  celebrate their ancestors and honored dead. During festivals on this day, people gather to share
  stories and legends, offer prayers for the fallen, and prepare for the coming cold.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="KeepingTimefromDaytoDay">Keeping Time from Day to Day</h3>
<p>
  Most people don’t keep track of the time of day beyond notions such as “midmorning” or “near
  sunset.” If people plan to meet at a particular time, they base their arrangements around such
  expressions.
</p>
<p>
  The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical
  clocks are often unreliable and rarely set consistently. If a local temple or civic structure has
  a clock that tolls the passing of the hours, people refer to hours as “bells,” as in “I’ll meet
  you at seven bells.”
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="RealmsTimeline">
  <p>Realms Timeline</p>
  <p>
    This timeline provides a summary of Faerûn’s history. Dates are provided in Dalereckoning (DR).
    Beginning with the year –700 DR, years have a name found in the Roll of Years, prophetic
    writings by the Netherese mage Augathra and expanded by Alaundo of Candlekeep:
  </p>
  <div class="left-indent condensed-group">
    <p>
      <strong>Days of Thunder (–35000 DR to –30000 DR).</strong> Water recedes to reveal the
      supercontinent of Merrouroboros, eventually inhabited by the so-called creator-races.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dawn Age (–30000 DR to –24000 DR).</strong> The empires of the creator-races fade,
      replaced by realms of dragons and giants. These two great peoples wage mighty war for
      centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>First Flowering (–24000 DR to –12000 DR).</strong> Elven civilizations supplant those
      of the dragons and giants. In –17600, elven high magic creates
      <a href="#Evermeet">Evermeet</a> and brings a cataclysm to Toril known as the Sundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Crown Wars (–12000 DR to –9000 DR).</strong> Elves war with each other for
      generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Founding Time (–9000 DR to –3000 DR).</strong> As elven influence declines, other
      realms arise, including Imaskar, Netheril, <a href="#Rashemen">Rashemen</a>, and
      <a href="#Unther">Unther</a>. The genies Calim and Memnon are bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Age of Humanity (–3000 DR to 1000 DR).</strong> Realms ruled by humans—including the
      <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a>, <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>, and Raumathar
      empires—spread across and dominate Faerûn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Present Age Begins (1000 DR).</strong> The present age is one of conflict, adventure,
      and global crises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time of Troubles (1358 DR).</strong> Deities wander the land as mortals and war
      against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Netheril Returns (1372 DR).</strong> The floating city of Thultanthar returns to
      <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> from the Shadowfell, and Shadovar begin rebuilding their
      empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spellplague (1385 DR).</strong> Cyric and Shar murder Mystra, triggering a series of
      disasters. Toril is briefly merged with the world of Abeir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Second Sundering(1482 DR to 1489 DR).</strong> Abeir and Toril separate again, and
      over several years, many of the effects of the Spellplague are reversed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Present (1501 DR).</strong> The current year is the Year of the Shining Mythal.</p>
  </div>
</aside>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Currency">Currency</h2>
<p>
  Nearly every major power of Faerûn has its own currency minted within its borders that represent
  both its influence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composition and standard weight are
  accepted across the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers to mint every sort of
  coin. The standard used to set the weight and value of coins is Waukeen’s <em>Golden Coin</em>, a
  relic that lies on sacred scales in the city of Schamedar in <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the most commonly found and widely accepted currencies in the Realms are summarized below.
  Each grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, electrum, gold, and (when present)
  platinum. Most people refer to coins by whatever name the issuing government uses, regardless of
  origin, except for Zhentil Keep—for some reason,
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> coins have
  unflattering epithets associated with them:
</p>
<div class="left-indent condensed-group">
  <p><strong>Amn:</strong> Fander, taran, centaur, danter, roldon</p>
  <p><strong>Calimshan:</strong> Unarche, decarche, centarche, bicenta, kilarche</p>
  <p><strong>Cormyr:</strong> Thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown</p>
  <p><strong>Sembia:</strong> Steelpence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble</p>
  <p><strong>Silverymoon:</strong> Glint, shield, sword, dragon, unicorn</p>
  <p><strong>Waterdeep:</strong> Nib, shard, sambar, dragon, sun</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Zhentil Keep:</strong> Fang (“dung-piece”), talon/naal (“flea-bit”), tarenth
    (“hardhammer”), glory (“weeping wolf”), platinum glory (“flat metal gem”)
  </p>
</div>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="Adventurers">Adventurers</h2>
<p>
  Adventurers have a long history in Faerûn. Children are told stories of great adventurers like
  Storm Silverhand, Drizzt Do’Urden, and Alias. While most people eventually put away their dreams
  of heroic adventure in favor of more practical matters, a few leave their homes to embark on a
  life of peril, hoping to become heroes who find great rewards. Individuals who suffer great
  tragedy in their lives might turn to adventuring out of desperation. Some adventurers are forced
  into the occupation when they or others are placed in sudden danger. A few individuals simply grow
  bored with their lives and dream of something more, becoming adventurers to reinvent themselves or
  find new meaning in their lives.
</p>
<p>
  The common folk of Faerûn look on adventurers with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust.
</p>
<p>
  An adventurer willing to risk their life on behalf of a complete stranger deserves applause and a
  reward, and many are envious that adventurers live their lives on their own terms, untrammeled by
  custom or convention.
</p>
<p>
  But adventurers are also dangerous, possessing skills and magic beyond the reach of Faerûn’s
  common folk. Their lives are violent, and where they go, chaos follows. Many adventuring parties
  have descended into an ancient crypt only to unwittingly release a horrifying evil on an
  unsuspecting world. And a successful adventurer amasses wealth and power very quickly—perhaps too
  quickly for rulers to monitor or for the law to handle.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless, authority figures often turn to adventurers to solve unusual problems. Towns and
  cities typically have a budget set aside for hiring adventurers.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="RegionsoftheRealms">Regions of the Realms</h2>
<p>
  Faerûn is frequently divided into various regions that share common cultural characteristics. The
  ten regions of the Forgotten Realms setting are as follows:
</p>
<div class="left-indent condensed-group">
  <p>
    <strong>Anauroch.</strong> The inhospitable desert of <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> and
    adjoining glacier is home to nomads and criss-crossed by trade caravans.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Arcane Empires.</strong> Three realms in east Faerûn are ruled by wielders of arcane
    magic: masked witches in <a href="#Rashemen">Rashemen</a>, sorcerers in
    <a href="#Aglarond">Aglarond</a>, and the infamous
    <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a> of
    <a href="#Thay">Thay</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Forgotten Lands.</strong> The remote northeast of Faerûn is home to vast mineral wealth
    and long-lost magical secrets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Heartlands.</strong> The rich, powerful realms of <a href="#Cormyr">Cormyr</a> and
    <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> surround the frontier settlements of the
    <a href="#Dalelands">Dalelands</a> and a legendary elven ruin.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Lands of Intrigue.</strong> The realms of <a href="#Amn">Amn</a>,
    <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a>, and <a href="#Tethyr">Tethyr</a> have not warred with each
    other for centuries, but this only hides a long history of political schemes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The North.</strong> Harsh weather, Underdark menaces, and isolation threaten the people
    of <a href="#IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a> and other settlements in a dangerous and unforgiving
    land.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Old Empires.</strong> The ancient realms of <a href="#Chessenta">Chessenta</a>,
    <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a>, and <a href="#Unther">Unther</a> are ruled—for better or for
    worse—by living gods.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sword Coast.</strong> Some of the largest and most well-known cities in Faerûn lie along
    its west coast, tied together by trade and shared history.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Trackless Sea.</strong> The island nations in the
    <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a> are isolated from each other but united by their
    dependence on the sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Vilhon Reach.</strong> The
    <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#EmeraldEnclave">Emerald Enclave</a>’s
    mystic island of Ilighôn lies at the entrance to the <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a>.
    Wielding arcane magic is a crime in most of the Vilhon Reach.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Each of these regions is described on the pages that follow and on the poster map in this book.
  Each region begins with a brief overview that summarizes key facts, as well as a map of the
  region. Subsequent sections detail the realms of each region, important cultural elements, and
  noteworthy places adventurers might visit.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="RegionsandLanguages">Regions and Languages</h3>
<p>
  Many realms, ethnicities, and cultural groups in Faerûn have their own language they use in
  addition to Common. These languages are noted in the gazetteer sections that follow. You can
  choose any of these languages as one of the languages your character knows. These regional
  languages, along with the standard languages from the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/phb-2024">Player’s Handbook</a>, are listed on the
  Standard Languages of Faerûn table, which you can use to randomly determine the languages your
  character knows (in addition to Common).

  Adventures in Anauroch include themes of survival, for the struggle against the brutal conditions
  never relaxes. In addition to the harsh climate, vicious creatures call the wastelands home,
  jealously guarding the lost magic and knowledge of the realms that rose and fell in the region’s
  past.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BedineTribes">Bedine Tribes</h4>
<p>
  The alternately blistering hot and bitingly frigid <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> desert was
  once the lush, thriving seat of the empire of Netheril. In the wake of the empire’s fall, and
  subsequent magical devastation by wicked aberrant monsters known as phaerimm, the desolate desert
  slowly spreads, threatening to devour the surrounding lands.
</p>
<p>
  The nomadic Bedine people have lived in Anauroch for centuries, traveling from oasis to oasis,
  living in tents, and following small herds of desert-dwelling animals. Most tribes live in the
  region known as the Sword and number around a hundred people, encountering another tribe only once
  or twice a year. Their knowledge of the desert and hardy survival skills command respect.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="EmpireofShadows">Empire of Shadows</h4>
<p>
  <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> is littered with the ruins of the ancient empire of Netheril,
  which fell in a magical cataclysm almost 3,000 years ago. Some of these ruins lie frozen in ice,
  their magical secrets preserved and waiting for Netherese survivors—or bold adventurers—to
  discover them. In the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), the Netherese flying city of Thultanthar, also
  called the City of Shade, emerged from the Shadowfell, where it had lain hidden for centuries. Its
  rulers, calling themselves Shadovar, began rebuilding their long-lost empire and even returning
  life and growth to the desert. Thultanthar fell in 1487 DR, crashing in Myth Drannor (see “<a
    href="#Heartlands"
    >Heartlands</a
  >” in this chapter), and the Shadovar empire fell with it. But survivors of that catastrophe are
  working to re-create the fallen city near the Shoal of Thirst.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shade.</em></strong> The former city of Thultanthar, capital of the Empire of Shade,
  was a magical flying marvel. After it crashed, survivors of the empire built a new settlement on
  the slopes of the Scimitar Spires, overlooking the Shoal of Thirst. Though this city, called
  Shade, can’t yet fly, it is inspired by old Thultanthar, and it resembles a piece of the
  Shadowfell transplanted to Faerûn. Its lightless avenues and sunless courtyards are shrouded in
  impenetrable gloom despite the desert’s glaring sun, providing a comfortable home for the city’s
  Shadovar rulers. Most explorers and traders avoid the city, as the Shadovar attack intruders.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ZhentarimCaravans">Zhentarim Caravans</h4>
<p>
  The <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> carved out a
  niche in <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> long ago by forging and securing caravan routes across
  the desert that bypass the High Ice to the north. Its guides and guards are experienced in
  navigating these paths and command steep prices to guide traders and travelers safely across with
  their wagon trains.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Black Road.</em></strong> The Black Road is the main trade route that crosses
  Anauroch. Zhentarim garrisons and patrols monitor the road and protect the life-giving oases that
  dot its length. They exert immense influence over this road. They provide protection, travel
  stations, and access to oases but expect their tolls to be paid promptly.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AnaurochFeatures">Anauroch Features</h4>
<p>
  Outsiders often imagine <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> to be a featureless expanse of desolate
  sand, but in fact it is defined by a glacier in the north and a central rocky plateau, both
  surrounded by the wind-blown sands.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>At’ar’s Looking Glass.</em></strong> A hazardous, sweltering stretch of desert in
  southeastern Anauroch is At’ar’s Looking Glass, named for the merciless Bedine sun god, whose face
  is reflected by the sand back up and into the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>High Ice.</em></strong> The desolate glacier called the High Ice crowns the northern
  reaches of Anauroch. Few people live here. Arctic monsters abound on the High Ice’s frosty plains,
  including different kinds of dragons. In spite of the danger, expeditions strike out into the
  glacier hoping to plunder ancient cities that have been buried in and preserved by ice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Plain of Standing Stones.</em></strong> The central region of Anauroch is the Plain of
  Standing Stones, a plateau that overlooks the sandy desert to the south. This area is mostly
  waterless, covered in gravel and jagged rock and ravaged by constant, howling winds. This is where
  the Shadovar first discovered chardalyn—a dark, icelike crystal that absorbs magic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Saiyaddar.</em></strong> One place in southern Anauroch teems with lush greenery and
  abundant animal life: the Saiyaddar. This verdant valley within the Sword is lined with natural
  springs that keep it watered, and the Bedine people guard the area as a hunting ground and safe
  waypoint for travelers. None of the individual Bedine tribes lay claim to Saiyaddar, and they work
  together fiercely to ensure that no one else tries.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Scimitar Spires.</em></strong> The Scimitar Spires is a range of sharp mountain peaks
  that abut the Shoal of Thirst and the lush Saiyaddar valley. Nestled in the northern reach of the
  Spires is Elah’zad, an oasis sacred to the god Eldath. A temple at the oasis is made of
  translucent desert rock; it’s said Eldath can speak through anyone who enters the temple.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shoal of Thirst.</em></strong> Shadovar magic once created and preserved a body of
  water here called the Shadow Sea. With Thultanthar’s destruction and the fall of the empire, the
  magical cloud cover that protected the sea blew away, and the desert swiftly reclaimed the land.
  Legends speak of valuable gems once buried beneath the sea that now lie exposed to treasure
  hunters, but the Shoal’s proximity to Shade makes excavation of those gems a dangerous task.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Sword.</em></strong> When most people think of Anauroch, they think of the
  southern region known as the Sword, named for the bandits and raiders who maraud the region.
  Vicious creatures such as wyverns and purple worms are abundant.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="NoteworthySites">Noteworthy Sites</h4>
<p>
  <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> is littered with ancient ruins, particularly those of fallen
  Netherese cities. For those willing to sift through the expanses of weathered stones and sand, the
  desert holds many secrets buried in time, many of which are powerful, valuable, or both.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Araugul.</em></strong> The southern region of Anauroch was once home to a large,
  expansionist goblinoid realm known as Hlundadim. The fortress-city of Araugul, also known as
  Goblinmount, was its capital and the home of the mysterious wizard Hlundadim, founder and leader
  of the realm. As weather in Anauroch grew arid and the land turned to dust, the goblins fled and
  the wizard vanished as mysteriously as he appeared. That was over a thousand years ago. Goblinoids
  and their allies have since returned to the ruins, and some live there still, defending the city
  from intruders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ascore.</em></strong> The ruined northern city of Ascore was once a bustling port on
  the shore of a now-dried sea. Now its windswept streets are haunted by undead, and the ancient
  blue dragon Iymrith has claimed the ruins as part of her territory. Somewhere in its depths,
  Ascore holds a portal into the lost Netherese city of Hlaungadath. The portal is activated by
  reading the final line of a carving in a stone archway.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Azirrhat.</em></strong> A small cluster of peaks on the southeast edge of the Plain of
  Standing Stones is known as Azirrhat, a word meaning “slashed rocks.” The crags are dotted with
  veins of gold, and prospectors sometimes brave encounters with the asabi, a territorial, nocturnal
  group of lizardfolk that dwell in the peaks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Heroes’ Helm.</em></strong> The rocky pinnacle of Heroes’ Helm in central Anauroch
  rises four hundred feet and is shaped like the helmet of a mighty warrior, complete with two caves
  where the warrior’s eyes would be. The caves lead to an expansive central cavern, home to an
  ancient blue dragon named Ghondalaath.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hlaungadath.</em></strong> One of the ruined flying cities of Netheril in Anauroch,
  Hlaungadath landed near the High Ice and was abandoned. In the ages since, it has been claimed by
  a powerful family of lamias. The city is still largely intact, maintained by the lamias and their
  thralls. The lamias kill most intruders, but they occasionally pick a few to ensnare with their
  curses and enchantments, keeping them as pets and servants. Most peoples of Anauroch know the
  place’s reputation and stay well away, but lost knowledge and potential wealth are powerful lures
  for adventurers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Lashloc.</em></strong> The so-called Lake of Ice is the result of subterranean hot
  springs that melt a sliver of the High Ice into a long, twisting lake. For creatures that live on
  the High Ice, Lashloc is an oasis—a place to stay warm and find liquid water without needing a
  fire. High winds freeze some of the lake’s surface water into ice floes. Predatory creatures lair
  within the lake, but three insidious aboleths dominate, using the lake’s unusual nature to draw in
  victims.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mines of Tethyamar.</em></strong> On the edge of Anauroch, southeast of Addas Babar,
  once lay the dwarven realm of Tethyamar. This vast city branched out underground as scattered and
  self-reliant neighborhoods that contributed to a large and thriving whole. Four centuries ago,
  Tethyamar was conquered by evil wizards commanding fiends and mercenaries. Repeated attempts to
  reclaim the city ended in failure. The survivors fled to Daggerdale in the
  <a href="#Dalelands">Dalelands</a>. The
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> had a long trade
  rivalry with Tethyamar when the city was lost, and Zhents have plundered the upper levels of the
  lost city for magical secrets and treasure.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Shattered Tower.</em></strong> Long ago, phaerimm magic brought down the cloud
  castle of a storm giant, which crashed in eastern Anauroch. Adventurers have found the skeletal
  remains of storm giants and looted many of its halls. The castle is vast and inhabited by
  elementals and a blue dragon that either survived the crash or moved in after.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Smokeholes.</em></strong> Travelers in the High Ice see huge gouts of smoke and
  steam rising from the Smokeholes from many miles away. These vents were created by a massive
  network of underground lava tubes and lakes known as the Caverns of Burning Ice, inhabited by
  salamanders and dragons that would otherwise find the High Ice inhospitable, including blue,
  brass, and red dragons. The heat from the lava creates vents in the ice above and carves out
  steamy grottoes that capture warm, wet air.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Untrivvin.</em></strong> Yetis dwell on the slopes of a mountain in the High Ice
  called Untrivvin, but the mountain’s interior is a catacomb of meticulously crafted tunnels and
  halls that echo and amplify any sound made within them. This is the source of the mountain’s name,
  which means “singing rock.” The honeycomb of passages within the mountain suggest that they were
  carved, perhaps by an ancient civilization predating even those of the giants and dragons.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeinAnauroch">Life in Anauroch</h4>
<p>
  Simply surviving in <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a> is a challenge. The people that dwell here
  rely on traditions based on generations of experience.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Banditry.</em></strong> Brigands, raiders, and other bandits are an unfortunate
  constant in Anauroch. Victims of these bandits face a choice: fight to defend their property, or
  allow raiders to take what they please in the hope that enough is left behind for life to
  continue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dry Death.</em></strong> Finding water is a struggle for anything that lives in this
  region. Most places are bone dry sand and dusty stone. The High Ice is a frozen glacier with no
  fuel for fire in sight.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gods and Names.</em></strong> Deities worshiped in Anauroch are often gods of the
  Faerûnian pantheon who go by other faces and names. At’ar, for example, is a pitiless sun god, but
  scholars of other lands consider her a form of Amaunator. Eldath, a god of peaceful waters,
  tenaciously maintains a presence in this harsh land, much like the springs and oases that offer
  life among the dust.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Travels and Trade.</em></strong> For many in Anauroch, life is spent on the move, as
  staying still often means death. Bedine tribes bring their food and livelihood with them,
  escorting herds between oases. Others, like the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a>, move back and
  forth over the Black Road, a dangerous but profitable route across the desert.

<p>
  For centuries, the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a> of
  <a href="#Thay">Thay</a> have threatened Faerûn, but no one has felt that threat more acutely than
  the realms of <a href="#Aglarond">Aglarond</a> and <a href="#Rashemen">Rashemen</a>, who have
  fought off Thayan raids and invasions and kept Thay bottled up within its old borders. To do this,
  Aglarondans and Rashemi have had to learn arcane magic powerful enough to match that of the Red
  Wizards.
</p>
<p>
  Aglarond, Rashemen, and Thay—collectively known as the Arcane Empires—are ruled by spellcasters.
  Although all kinds of arcane magic are practiced in these lands, each realm has its own preferred
  magical tradition. In Aglarond, where the legendary Simbul once ruled, sorcery reigns supreme. In
  Rashemen, warlocks called hathrans forge pacts with mighty spirits known as telthors. And, in
  Thay, the word of a Red Wizard is law. All the Arcane Empires maintain large fighting forces
  augmented by spellcasting leaders. The common folk of these lands, though, aren’t spellcasters;
  magical training is a sign of status and power.
</p>
<p>
  Adventures here spotlight the struggle against supernatural foes, with both heroes and villains
  wielding dazzling arcane magic. Sometimes this struggle takes place on the battlefield between
  armies. But often characters wage war in the shadows, infiltrating Thayan strongholds or sniffing
  out Red Wizard agents.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Aglarond">Aglarond</h4>
<p>
  The realm of Aglarond was founded five centuries ago, bringing together human settlers and elves
  of the Yuirwood in a treaty of mutual defense and friendship. For centuries, the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a> of
  <a href="#Thay">Thay</a> have posed a constant threat, leaving Aglarondans distrusting of arcane
  magic. This changed under the leadership of the Simbul, a sorcerer of legendary power whose
  goodness—while capricious—was beyond question. Under the Simbul’s leadership, individuals born
  with arcane magic were trained as sorcerers, and this tradition has continued after her death. Now
  the realm is ruled by the Simbarch Council, most of whom are arcane spellcasters.
</p>
<p>
  Aglarond is famous as a place where elves and humans have come together to form a single realm.
  Marriage between elves and humans is common there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Altumbel.</em></strong> The small human kingdom called Altumbel is often considered
  part of Aglarond, but its inhabitants assert its independence and distinct identity. People here
  make their living from the sea, and the capital, Spandeliyon, is called the City of Pirates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fang Light.</em></strong> The small peninsula that juts north of Velprintalar is known
  as South Fang. (Cape Dragonfang in <a href="#Thesk">Thesk</a>, on the north side of the Sea of
  Dlurg, is called North Fang in Aglarond.) It’s an isolated and parochial backwater whose
  inhabitants are derisively known as “Fangers” by other residents of the
  <a href="#ArcaneEmpires">Arcane Empires</a>. At the tip of South Fang stands Fang Light, a magical
  lighthouse maintained by a mage that guides ships in and out of the Sea of Dlurg. Pirates
  frequently target the lighthouse.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sunglade.</em></strong> Just inside the southern edge of the Yuirwood stands the
  Sunglade, a double circle of standing stones decorated with elven runes. This ancient site was
  constructed by and sacred to inhabitants of the Yuirwood who left or died out long ago. The outer
  ring of larger stones bears dedications to deities of the elven pantheon, the Seldarine, while the
  inner stones represent the deities of long-gone human inhabitants of the Yuirwood. Though
  apparently abandoned, the stones remain in excellent repair, and a mystic presence lingers in the
  sunny glade, waiting for someone to speak to it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Umber Marshes.</em></strong> Named for the rusty water created by its iron deposits,
  the Umber Marshes is the border between Aglarond and <a href="#Thay">Thay</a>. Countless raids and
  invasions have criss-crossed this swamp, which is famous for intolerable bloodsucking insects and
  deadly monsters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Velprintalar.</em></strong> The crown jewel of the Aglarond peninsula is Velprintalar,
  one of the most beautiful cities in Faerûn. The Simbarch Council, made up of sorcerers and other
  spellcasters, rules Aglarond from a magnificent palace of pale-green Mulhorandi stone. Sorcerers
  from across Faerûn come here for training.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Watchwall.</em></strong> Between the fortress city of Glarondar and the slopes of the
  mountain Umbergoth stretches the fifteen-mile-long stone Watchwall built long ago by galeb duhr
  for the Aglarondan crown. The Watchers—guards assigned to the wall—keep a constant lookout for
  Thayan aggression.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Wizards’ Reach.</em></strong> The cities along Aglarond’s south coast are nominally
  ruled by Aglarond, but in practice the farther east one goes, the more the Red Wizards hold sway.
  Cross-country travel through the coastal marshes is difficult. Monsters leave the eaves of the
  Yuirwood and roam the coast of the Wizards’ Reach.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Yuirwood.</em></strong> Elves who settled this forest millennia ago were called Yuir.
  Over centuries, humans joined them and adopted elven traditions, living among ancient Yuir ruins.
  These woods are protected by powerful magic that blocks scrying and detection spells. Fey
  crossings are plentiful, and many dangerous animals call the forest home.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Rashemen">Rashemen</h4>
<p>
  An infamously insular realm of deep forests, high mountains, and wind-blasted heaths, Rashemen is
  home to magical practices considered strange by outsiders but also respected as frightfully
  potent. The warriors of Rashemen are berserkers known for their fierce frenzy in battle. The ruler
  of the realm, titled the Iron Lord, is chosen from among the berserkers by a council of
  mask-wearing spellcasters called hathrans. The hathrans are leaders in many aspects of Rashemen’s
  society, drawing their magic from pacts with powerful spirits that dwell in the realm’s magical
  woodlands. The current Iron Lord is Mangan Uruk, who has held the position for a generation.
</p>
<p>
  The people of Rashemen revere a trio of gods they call the Three: Bhalla (the Den Mother),
  Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and the Hidden One. In addition to these gods, countless potent and
  dangerous spirits called telthor live in the forests and wild spaces of Rashemen. These gods and
  spirits make pacts with spellcasters, who don individualized masks representing their pacts. These
  spellcasters are called wychlaran (“wise ones”), in recognition of the wisdom bestowed on them in
  their pacts.
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, wychlaran women are called hathrans (“wise sisters”) and form a governing council
  that selects the Iron Lord, while wychlaran men are called vremyonni (“old ones”) and support the
  hathrans by crafting magic items and inventing new spells. These roles have relaxed as Rashemen
  has opened more to the outside world, and wychlaran outside of Rashemen aren’t bound to these
  roles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ashenwood.</em></strong> By order of the hathrans, no one is permitted to live in this
  ancient forest, which is home to mighty spirits, intelligent animals, and fierce monsters. Rashemi
  enter Ashenwood to commune with or hunt these creatures, placating the spirits with gifts and
  offerings of food.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Citadel Rashemar.</em></strong> Once a mighty fortress, Citadel Rashemar was flattened
  over a century ago by invaders from the east who slaughtered the entire garrison of two thousand
  warriors. Now a coven of hags controls the ruins, served by a small army of goblins, giant
  animals, ogres, and other monsters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>High Country.</em></strong> The north end of the Sunrise Mountains is called the High
  Country. This perilous region is marked by wild magic, strange occurrences, and crumbling
  monoliths built by the ancient empire of Raumathar. These monoliths imprison demons summoned and
  once controlled by <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>; now hathrans check them every year to ensure
  the wards don’t fail. An ancient white dragon, Kissethkashan, commands these mountains, but the
  site of his lair is unknown.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Immilmar.</em></strong> Traders, diplomats, and tourists coming to Rashemen often
  first arrive in Immilmar, Rashemen’s capital. The Iron Lord, the nominal leader of the nation,
  rules from a mighty castle raised centuries ago by hathran magic and warded with spells. Beyond
  the castle, citizens dwell in A-frame timber lodges. The city is insular, and visitors are
  encouraged to leave as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mines of Tethkel.</em></strong> The Rashemi folk who live and work in this iron mine
  are infamously fractious, violent, and unruly. Goblin bandits and worgs prowl the outskirts of the
  town looking for prey, while kobolds lair in the mines. The kobolds have spent decades building a
  lair fit for a dragon, and an egg in their hoard has recently hatched into a deep dragon wyrmling.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>North Country.</em></strong> The North Country is the land between the Falls of Erech
  and the Towers of Smoke. While officially part of Rashemen, this land is sparsely populated and
  scattered with ruined settlements from the ancient realms of <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a> and
  Raumathar. Rashemi warriors venture into the North Country and plunder these ruins to prove their
  valor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ring of Gray Flames.</em></strong> Five ancient towers built by the Raumathari
  civilization stand in a circle known as the Ring of Gray Flames. Most are ruined, but two are
  intact, and mechanical sounds and grinding noises come from within. From atop all five, gray
  flames spout. Divine magic doesn’t work within or near the towers, and the region is prowled by
  strange guardians—arcane spells brought to life.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shevel.</em></strong> Tradespeople established the town of Shevel near the Golden Road
  trade route to craft and peddle their wares. Over time, the town grew into a thriving, walled city
  of immigrants within the otherwise-isolated realm of Rashemen. Since the fall of Citadel Rashemar,
  raids from the lands to the east have been a regular occurrence, and there’s always mercenary work
  to be found in Shevel.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sunrise Mountains.</em></strong> Most people consider the nigh-impassible Sunrise
  Mountains the eastern edge of Faerûn. The range towers fifteen thousand feet high and is littered
  with ruined towers from the ancient realm of Raumathar and mysterious wells that date to some
  other forgotten culture. The few passes over the mountains are exceedingly dangerous, and many
  lethal creatures lair in deep caves and subterranean passages.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Urlingwood.</em></strong> The mystical heart of Rashemen, Urlingwood is a dense, wild
  forest populated by telthors and supernatural beasts. Rashemen law dictates only hathrans are
  permitted here under penalty of death.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Thay">Thay</h4>
<p>
  Thay has a reputation as a barren wasteland ruled by tyrannical wizards and populated by their
  undead minions. The truth is more complex.
</p>
<p>
  While much of Thay remains barren, ancient weather-controlling spells bring enough rain for rivers
  and forests. The word of a Red Wizard is law, but most
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a> are more
  interested in self-advancement than conquest. And while undead walk openly in Thay, necromancy is
  just one of eight schools of magic, and Thay is home to many ordinary citizens just trying to live
  out their lives. All this combines to make Thay more than the caricature known throughout Faerûn,
  even if this exaggerated reputation is built on a foundation of truth.
</p>
<p>
  Thay’s infamous undead ruler, Szass Tam, rules Thay, assisted by seven other zulkirs, each a
  master of a different school of magic. Few dare to oppose Szass Tam, but the zulkirs and the
  rulers of Thay’s various tharchs have considerable leeway to do as they please, so long as they
  don’t attract Szass Tam’s attention.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#Aglarond">Aglarond</a> and <a href="#Rashemen">Rashemen</a> pride themselves as realms
  that keep Thay in check, thwarting the Red Wizards’ territorial and magical ambitions. Thayan
  rulers, called tharchions, try to invade Aglarond or Rashemen every decade or so, and border raids
  are constant.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Citadel.</em></strong> A vast and ancient fortress that predates the Red Wizards
  of Thay, the Citadel was carved out of one of the highest mountains of Thaymount by a lizard-like
  people who left their images in statues and murals. The Citadel towers among lava, ash, and
  razor-sharp rocks and has extensive subterranean levels. For centuries, the Citadel has been
  Thay’s greatest stronghold, and Szass Tam has claimed it for his own. In the Citadel, Szass Tam is
  unassailable. In the time since he moved into the Citadel, many magical atrocities have occurred
  there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Delhumide.</em></strong> Thay began as a colony of the distant Mulhorandi empire, and
  Delhumide was Thay’s capital. Now the old city is a dangerous ruin inhabited by fiends, evil fey,
  and desperate folk. These threats keep the region around the ruins sparsely populated, but
  adventurers brave the ruins in search of lost Thayan treasures.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Plateau of Thay and Thaymount.</em></strong> Central Thay stands on a vast, desolate
  plateau. Magic formalized by Red Wizards long ago brings rain here, which in turn allows towns,
  cities, and forests to survive. A second higher plateau rises from the first, culminating in the
  volcanic peaks of Thaymount. Only Red Wizards and their guests are allowed there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tax Stations.</em></strong> Small fortresses called tax stations dot Thay’s border,
  roads, and internal boundaries. Soldiers at each station check identification papers and collect
  small but frequent tolls. A typical tax station has a garrison of thirty to fifty warriors, often
  including a pack of gnolls.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tharchs.</em></strong> Thay is divided into districts called tharchs, many named after
  a prominent city in that region; every tharch is governed by a tharchion who answers to one of the
  eight zulkirs. The eleven tharchs are the Alaor (two islands that house Thay’s fleet and
  shipyards), Delhumide, Eltabbar, Gauros (everything between the Gauros River and the Sunrise
  Mountains), High Thay (bounded by the Second Escarpment), Lapendrar (bordering
  <a href="#Thesk">Thesk</a> and <a href="#Aglarond">Aglarond</a>), Priador, Pyarados, Surthay,

<p>
  Faerûn’s northeast quadrant is a land of lost magical secrets, buried ancient empires, and literal
  mountains of unclaimed wealth. Between the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south and the
  <a href="#GreatGlacier">Great Glacier</a> to the north, merchant-princes and archdruids struggle
  for dominion over a harsh, beautiful wilderness and its bounteous resources. Even the land itself
  vies for supremacy; for every ruler who claims to control a realm, there lies a magical glacier, a
  shifting labyrinthine forest, or a monster-plagued mountain that proves nothing in these parts can
  truly be controlled.
</p>
<p>
  The remote north—<a href="#Damara">Damara</a>, <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>, and the
  <a href="#GreatDale">Great Dale</a>—has a well-earned reputation as a harsh land. The climate is
  dismal, the soil is rocky, and the food is bland. But beneath its crusty exterior, the land teems
  with river-size veins of gold, caverns lined with gemstones, and buried cities. Those who can
  endure toiling in the frozen northlands could strike it rich at any moment.
</p>
<p>
  Conversely, creature comforts abound in the rich kingdoms of <a href="#Impiltur">Impiltur</a> and
  <a href="#Thesk">Thesk</a>, to say nothing of the Vast’s lush pasturelands and rolling hills of
  golden grain. Yet, though Impiltur and Thesk are lands of plenty, competition is fierce.
  Adventurers arrive in droves to cities like Procampur and Telflamm. Gold and jewels are readily
  abundant in the north, but those who hope to prosper in these realms should be prepared to work
  fast and face terrible danger.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Damara">Damara</h4>
<p>
  In Damara, hardy folk from many backgrounds work together to turn rocky soil into tillable
  farmland or extract bloodstone from the mountains to the west. Currently, the usurper King Yarin
  Frostmantle sits smugly on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty while his people complain about
  his tyranny and the growing threat from demons across the country. Despite—or perhaps because
  of—these facts, Damara is a thriving adventuring hub.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bloodstone.</em></strong> Nowhere is the bloodstone trade stronger in the
  <a href="#ForgottenLands">Forgotten Lands</a> than in west Damara. Here, amid the East Galena
  Mountains that separate the lands of Damara from neighboring Vaasa, the ruins of a settlement
  called Bloodstone mark the infamous Bloodstone Pass. In its 150-year history, Bloodstone served as
  the battleground for monsters, assassins, warlocks, and countless others who wished to command the
  gem trade. Its most recent attackers razed Bloodstone to the ground. Little remains of the site
  except for an ancient, petrified tree that, if legends are to be believed, once bore golden
  leaves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Glacier of the White Worm.</em></strong> Nestled near the heart of the Earthspur
  Mountains is the Glacier of the White Worm: a mass of ice populated by herds of titanic white
  remorhazes and—if rumors are to be believed—a “king worm” that rules over the others. Devotees of
  Ilmater from the nearby Monastery of the Yellow Rose practice their sacred remorhaz-taming rites
  here; a monk who entreats and rides a white remorhaz is said to bear the “gift of the worm” and is
  afforded great prestige. Yellow Rose sages speculate that the glacier must be magical, for it is
  too far south for a nonmagical glacier to exist. The source of this magic, however, remains
  unknown.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="GreatDale">Great Dale</h4>
<p>
  Between <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a> to the north and <a href="#Thesk">Thesk</a> to the south
  are two imposing forests called the Dunwood and the Forest of Lethyr. These forests, in turn,
  surround a narrow strip of grassland called the Great Dale. Xenophobic druids, reclusive rangers,
  and enigmatic fey call this realm home and welcome few others into their domain. Those who brave
  the Great Dale’s depths should keep their wits about them and their spellbooks close—traditional
  maps are all but useless in the mazelike woods, making divination magic essential for navigation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dunwood.</em></strong> Dunwood is a soupy morass of firs and oaks that thins to muskeg
  in the north. The peaty soil has preserved the ruins of elven and Nar cities. The Dunwood’s
  countless secrets tempt treasure hunters bold enough to challenge the monsters rampant in the
  realm: zombies infused with demonic power, ancient living trees with inscrutable motives, and an
  extensive family of sadistic green dragons.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dun-Tharos.</em></strong> This great ruin near the center of the Dunwood is the former
  capital of ancient <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>. Great plazas and wrecked temples devoted to
  demonic powers lie half-buried in the mist-shrouded bog. Various fell powers have claimed to rule
  over these wretched ruins, which are practically unexplored by adventurers. That might change
  soon—rumors circulating in roadside inns speak of powerful Nar treasures buried in crumbling
  shrines and flooded conjuring chambers hidden beneath the old ruins of Dun-Tharos.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Forest of Lethyr.</em></strong> Mysteries abound in the gloomy Forest of Lethyr. The
  druids of Lethyr brook few trespassers in their sacred groves, and they resort to violence against
  anyone who means to exploit the land’s abundant resources. Outsiders who persist in exploring
  Lethyr might discover Yeshelmaar, the center of civilization in the Great Dale and a testament to
  elven engineering. In Yeshelmaar, visitors can see architectural marvels: vast, floating herb
  gardens; tiered stone courts; and ornately carved grottoes with pools of crystalline spring water,
  to name just a few.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="GreatGlacier">Great Glacier</h4>
<p>
  The Great Glacier originally formed from the ice necklace of the deity Ulutiu. The people who call
  this vast territory home are the Ulutiuns. Few southerners have ever interacted with them. Most
  outsiders who dare tread these arctic wastes instead encounter fierce monsters adapted to the
  glacier—white dragons, remorhazes, and even ice devils. The latter are said to be servants of an
  ancient and mighty priest of Auril who styles herself “the Ice Queen.”
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Impiltur">Impiltur</h4>
<p>
  In the past, Impiltur was among the wealthiest realms in Faerûn. Over the past century, though,
  the realm unsuccessfully grappled with magically altered geography and incursions from demons and
  demon worshipers. Now the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars have risen again, and Impiltur’s
  wealth and influence are returning. Hopeful commoners whisper that a lost monarch of the old
  ruling family will rise up to restore Impiltur to the great empire it once was.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Lyrabar.</em></strong> The capital city of Impiltur, Lyrabar, boasts numerous sailing
  academies. The academies are fierce rivals and host regattas and other contests of skill
  year-round. One of the academies, Waywater’s Nautical University, specializes in teaching
  abjuration magic to seafaring mages. Lyrabar hosts the headquarters of the Warswords,
  chainmail-clad soldiers responsible for patrolling Impiltur’s trade roads and keeping merchants
  safe from brigands and monsters. Warswords sometimes deputize adventurers as
  “swordpoints”—temporary agents of t he law granted special privileges within Impiltur’s borders.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Narfell">Narfell</h4>
<p>
  The ruins of two ancient empires—Narfell, home to demon worshipers, and Raumathar, known for its
  battle mages—dot the plains where nomadic horse riders now roam, offering abundant opportunities
  for brave deeds and exploration. The Nars don’t care about dynasties or family lines. Rather, they
  believe actions speak for themselves. This sensible attitude also explains most riders’ preference
  to avoid the demon-cursed ruins of ancient Narfell. However, some now dwelling on the plains wish
  to reclaim ancient Narfell’s powerful, sinister magic for a new generation of Nar demonologists.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bildoobaris.</em></strong> In a vast, empty plain beneath the shadow of Mount Nar,
  tens of thousands of nomads gather for one tenday every summer for an annual trade meet, forming a
  vast tent city called Bildoobaris. Here, Nars barter in horses, furs, and jewelry; share news and
  oral histories; and celebrate the realm’s all-too-brief time of plenty. In recent years, Nar
  demonologists have come to Bildoobaris bearing demonic relics and weapons from the buried cities
  of ancient Narfell in the hope of recruiting more followers.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Thesk">Thesk</h4>
<p>
  Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East because it is the western terminus of the Golden
  Way, an ancient trade road that connected Faerûn to lands beyond the Sunrise Mountains. Although
  much of the Golden Way now lies in ruins, remnants of the old road still appear in the
  well-traveled hills between Thesk’s largest cities—Telflamm, Phsant, and Tammar. Thesk’s glory
  days as a trade metropolis are over, and Theskian wealth is now concentrated in the uppermost
  echelons of society, whose oligarchs exploit the working class via all manner of harebrained
  investment schemes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Golden Way.</em></strong> Despite its history as the most famous trade route between
  Faerûn and lands to the east, the Golden Way is now a shadow of its former self. In Faerûn, the
  Golden Way begins at the western edge of Thesk, where well-maintained roads connect the cities of
  Telflamm, Phent, Phsant, and Tammar. Beyond Thesk’s borders, the Golden Way becomes a path through
  the plains of Ashanath, connects to <a href="#Rashemen">Rashemen</a> via various ferries, and
  dissolves into little more than piles of stones—way markers—as it wraps around the Sunrise
  Mountains and continues eastward through the Hordelands and beyond. Interspersed here and there
  along the road are encampments and travel stations that provide shelter for those daring to make
  the months-long intercontinental journey.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Telflamm.</em></strong> The largest city in Thesk isn’t controlled by that realm, but
  by the Shadowmasters, a religious thieves’ guild that owns the city’s inns and gambling halls and
  exercises considerable influence over Thesk’s government. The Shadowmasters operate out of the
  House of the Master’s Shadow, the largest temple to Mask in Faerûn.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheVast">The Vast</h4>
<p>
  The Vast isn’t a unified realm, but a common term for the great swath of land bound by the Dragon
  Reach to the west, the <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a> to the north,
  <a href="#Impiltur">Impiltur</a> to the east, and the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south. The
  region’s name comes from Vastar, the orc kingdom that once ruled this place and warred with the
  surrounding dwarven and elven communities. The Vast of today is primarily peaceful farmland ringed
  by prosperous coastal cities. Countless treasures lie buried just beneath the land’s surface,
  either in dwarven ruins, orc crypts, or forgotten battlegrounds.
</p>
<p>
  As in other lands that touch the Earthspur Mountains, the gem trade is strong in the Vast, and
  many miners and adventurers alike come to the foothills seeking their fortune. The wisest are
  wary, for many of the tunnels that ribbon the Earthspurs connect to the Underdark, whose
  communities are far less welcoming of outsiders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Procampur.</em></strong> One of the oldest extant settlements along the Sea of Fallen
  Stars, Procampur was built atop an underground dwarven town called Proeskampalar. Procampur is
  known for its walled city districts, with slate-roofed buildings. More than its handsome
  architecture, though, Procampur is reputedly the single richest independent city along the
  northern Inner Sea. Hundreds of gem cutters and goldsmiths call the place home, and it would be a
  popular target for pirates if not for its incomparable fortifications and vigilant local
  government.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheForgottenLands">Life in the Forgotten Lands</h4>
<p>
  Savage winters, perilous wilds, and fierce rivals mean that only the hardy survive long in the
  <a href="#ForgottenLands">Forgotten Lands</a>. Those who can meet the challenges of these realms
  are formidable indeed, contributing to this region’s reputation as a land of grim settlers and
  cutthroat traders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Adventurers’ Hub.</em></strong> The Forgotten Lands are a popular destination for
  adventurers from all over Faerûn. These realms are rich with history and magic that can turn a
  peasant into a monarch. Not all who journey to this region yearn for fame, however; many come to
  remote realms like <a href="#Damara">Damara</a> to forget their old lives and forge new destinies.
  And the Forgotten Lands are filled with material wealth; those who seek fortune here can dredge it
  up from the seafloor, carve it out of a mountain, or retrieve it from a dungeon.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bloodstone Economy.</em></strong> Realms in this corner of Faerûn benefit from
  abundant resources in nearby mountain ranges. The East Galenas, Earthspurs, and Earthfasts are
  rich in rare metals and gemstones, especially chalcedony, known locally as bloodstone. This gem is
  so plentiful—and so vital to the local economy—that these areas are sometimes referred to as the
  Bloodstone Lands.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Brutal Climes.</em></strong> Life is hard in most of the Forgotten Lands. Long, icy
  winters and fleeting, muddy summers make for difficult farming. Many find other ways to
  subsist—such as trapping, mining, or fishing—but these trades are only slightly less trying in the
  region’s frigid climate. Fussy nobles and soft urbanites don’t last long in these parts; the
  average denizen of the Forgotten Lands is one of the toughest, most down-to-earth people one will
  ever meet.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Living with the Elements.</em></strong> Regional natives must cope with the
  inhospitable climate. The nomads of <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>, for example, migrate south
  during the dark months, avoiding the brunt of winter’s chill. Elsewhere, such as the Monastery of
  the Yellow Rose in Damara, people overcome the elements by mastering magic and enlisting the aid
  of local fauna. (See “Glacier of the White Worm” above.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Trade Prevails.</em></strong> For all their talk of autonomy and self-determination,
  the people of the Forgotten Lands also understand the importance of sharing goods and information.
  Trade in these realms begins in the mountains of Damara and plains of Narfell, from where it flows
  toward the Sea of Fallen Stars as a rushing river that empties into the rich ports of
  <a href="#Impiltur">Impiltur</a> and <a href="#Thesk">Thesk</a>. Gold is everywhere in the
  Forgotten Lands, but unlike in other wealthy regions like <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a> and
  the Sword Coast, folk here hold onto their wealth instead of flaunting it in the form of lavish
  palaces or gilded statues.

  The Heartlands comprises four realms, each with borders that have fluctuated over the centuries.
  Its folk have hardy frontier spirits, for their lands are ripe with crops, resources, and danger.
  Monsters lurk in every forest and mountain range. No matter the threat, the people of the
  Heartlands must be ready to defend their homes.
</p>
<p>
  The Heartlands is rife with classic medieval fantasy adventure. The

  <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> are well suited for tales of knightly warfare or noble intrigue.
  Adventures around the Moonsea might involve ending the reign of a cruel tyrant. For a classic D&D

  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/dnd/fraif">Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</a> for
  more on the Dalelands and Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p>
  The political landscape of the Heartlands is ever changing. Towns are absorbed into larger realms
  but might break out again when those realms are stretched too thin.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Cormyr">Cormyr</h4>
<p>
  Cormyr has a legacy of chivalry and military might. Cormyr’s army,
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#ThePurpleDragonKnights"
    >the Purple Dragon Knights</a
  >, is the largest of any kingdom in Faerûn. Led by the just Queen Raedra Obarskyr, the Purple
  Dragon Knights and their allied war wizards train to fight both on land and in the sky. As
  monstrous threats from the Storm Horns and the Hullack Forest increase, and as
  <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> grows ever larger, Queen Raedra has paused Cormyr’s expansion efforts
  to focus on defending and strengthening its borders. She also sends her Purple Dragon Knights
  across Faerûn on their amethyst dragon steeds to do good deeds, collect information, further her
  goals, and popularize Cormyr in the hearts and minds of common folk.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Farsea Marshes and Marshes of Tun.</em></strong> The ruins of two prehistoric
  civilizations, preceding even the elves’ arrival in the <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a>, lie
  in the pestilent marshes of Farsea and Tun in Cormyr’s north. Explorers who have braved the
  marshes’ monsters and magical sicknesses theorize that these societies released magical contagions
  on each other, resulting in their mutual destruction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Huthduth.</em></strong> A monastery devoted to Chauntea, Huthduth lies in a wooded
  valley just south of the Farsea Marshes and is well protected with walls and militant priests. It
  is named after its founder, whose benevolent spirit still haunts the monastery and periodically
  manifests. Priests raise sheep and make wine from local berries, but the well-defended nature of
  the place has led many to believe Huthduth houses a secret inhabitant, a valuable treasure, or
  magic unknown to the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shargrailar’s Lair.</em></strong> The ancient red dragon Shargrailar was the first
  dracolich Sammaster, the lich leader of the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#CultOfTheDragon">Cult of the Dragon</a>,
  created using the [magicitems]Tome of the Dragon[/magicitems]. The dracolich was destroyed more
  than a century ago with spellfire, but his lair, dug out of the Thunder Peaks near the headwaters
  of the Immerflow, remains a place of pilgrimage for the Cult of the Dragon and a nursery for red
  dragon wyrmlings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sunset Mountains.</em></strong> The towering Sunset Mountains are home to the
  Darkhold, a powerful
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> stronghold.
  Dragons dying of natural causes often come to the Sunset Mountains to spend their last hours at an
  extinct volcanic caldera called the Well of Dragons. The Cult of the Dragon’s base beneath the
  Well has been vanquished, but cult leaders have been spotted probing the ruins.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Suzail.</em></strong> Suzail is the capital of Cormyr. Its monarch, the skilled sword
  fighter Queen Raedra Obarskyr, rules from the Dragon Throne. Her royal authority is kept in check
  by the Suzail Writ, a fifty-year-old piece of legislation that holds Cormyr’s monarch to the same
  laws as the rest of its citizens.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Thunder Peaks.</em></strong> The storm-battered Thunder Peaks were once home to
  Shargrailar, Faerûn’s first dracolich. These days, a dracolich called Aurgloroasa, formerly a
  shadow dragon, lairs in an abandoned dwarven city within the mountain range. Also known as the
  Sibilant Shade, she commands the Cult of the Dragon’s Sembian sect.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tilverton.</em></strong> A rift to the Shadowfell wrought havoc on the Cormyrian town
  of Tilverton between the Desertsmouth Mountains and the Thunder Peaks. Now, all that remains is a
  vast crater of writhing darkness, from which monsters of shadow stuff periodically emerge.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Dalelands">Dalelands</h4>
<p>
  The Dalelands is a loose collection of tiny vales called dales, each with its own territory,
  governance, and character. To the south, Archendale is well fortified, protecting tranquil
  Battledale, elven Deepingdale, and the rest of the dales from Sembian invasion, though Tasseldale
  still struggles from a history of Sembian influence. Distrustful Daggerdale, unassuming
  Shadowdale, and bountiful Mistledale sit to the west, where High Dale enjoys a defense treaty with
  <a href="#Cormyr">Cormyr</a>. Laissez-faire Featherdale, ambitious Scardale, and Harrowdale—the
  oldest dale—lie to the east. Every year at Midwinter, delegates from each dale convene for a Dales
  Council to discuss issues affecting the Dalelands at large. The location of the Dale Council
  changes from year to year.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dales Compact.</em></strong> When human settlers first arrived in the area now known
  as the Dalelands, the forest of Cormanthor was already occupied by a thriving elven civilization.
  These wary elves proposed the Dales Compact: an agreement that allowed humans to settle on the
  edges of Cormanthor or in places that the great trees didn’t grow, so long as they didn’t cut
  deeper into the forest. Human mages erected a stone obelisk called the Standing Stone in
  Cormanthor as a symbol of unity between the two species. This date became the beginning of the
  Dalereckoning, or 1 DR, marking the first year of the modern Faerûnian calendar. Though
  Cormanthor’s elven civilization fell long ago and few elves still live there, the people of the
  Dalelands still respect the Dales Compact.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Archenbridge.</em></strong> A history of Sembian invasions has led the trading hub of
  Archenbridge (the chief settlement of Archendale) to become the most fortified town in the
  Dalelands. Most goods from <a href="#Cormyr">Cormyr</a> and <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> flow
  through this walled, trap-filled town to the rest of the dales.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cormanthor.</em></strong> Cormanthor is a forest of towering trees. Most of the elves
  who once lived here left long ago, but some refugees of Myth Drannor’s second fall remain. A swath
  of fungi, oozes, and rot called Moander’s Road was carved through Cormanthor’s northern reaches by
  the rampaging god of corruption and rot, Moander.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Myth Drannor.</em></strong> The elven metropolis of Myth Drannor fell hundreds of
  years ago to demonic forces. Elves briefly reclaimed it in the last century, but then the flying
  Shadovar city of Thultanthar crashed into it, doing extensive damage. Now demons and other
  monsters again infest Myth Drannor’s remains. Its many ruins invite adventurers to seek the lost
  city’s treasures or find a way to restore its mythal.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Scardale Town.</em></strong> The infamously lawless harbor of Scardale Town is home to
  several criminal syndicates and an enclave of
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a>. Its people
  still reel from the memory of the Shaking Plague, a magical contagion that decimated its
  population. The town is governed by Lord Kharu Aumersair, a tiefling sorcerer who claims descent
  from Elminster, through the infamous
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> agent Scyllua
  Darkhope and her father, Lashan Aumersair. Scardale has a history of being ruled by invaders, and
  Lord Aumersair has used this resentment of outsiders to unite the town’s criminal syndicates into
  an alliance that supports his rule.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shadowdale Town.</em></strong> Though small and unassuming at first glance, many
  consider sleepy Shadowdale Town the Dalelands’ cultural heart. It was once home to Elminster and
  Storm Silverhand, though neither has been seen in town for years. These days, a growing community
  of orcs from the River Ashaba have settled in Shadowdale. Lady Khara Sulwood rules from the
  twisted Tower of Ashaba, with the help of the elf warrior Tharinel, her reliable bodyguard and
  adviser.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Moonsea">Moonsea</h4>
<p>
  Named after its central body of water, the Moonsea is a region of disparate cities ruled by cruel
  despots. It is a land of people hardened long ago by the assaults and schemes of chromatic
  dragons. The people of the Moonsea view the rest of Faerûn and even other Moonsea cities with
  distrust. In turn, people elsewhere in Faerûn view these folk as unfriendly and dangerous.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hillsfar.</em></strong> The independent walled city of Hillsfar, on the southern shore
  of the Moonsea, is busy, prosperous, and secured by a mercenary company called the Red Plumes.
  Until recently, Hillsfar’s Great Law of Humanity barred non-humans from entering the city. After a
  revolution deposed First Lord Torin Nomerthal, his successor, Vuhm Yestral, revoked the law.
  Hillsfar still suffers from strained relations between humans and other species, and progress is
  slower than Vuhm would like. In the wake of Zhentil Keep’s decline, Hillsfar’s only rival for
  dominance of the Moonsea is the city of Mulmaster.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Melvaunt.</em></strong> A cloud of smog hangs over the austere and unwelcoming Moonsea
  city of Melvaunt courtesy of its hundreds of forges. This polluted merchant town is a smith’s
  haven and a den of crime.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Moonsea.</em></strong> Rumors persist of isles that rise from the cold, purplish
  depths of the eponymous Moonsea on certain nights of the year. An underwater tower called the Bell
  of the Depths is said to be guarded by the ghosts of the first humans who settled the Moonsea
  region. Its spire is visible from the water’s surface, and it tolls on foggy nights with the sound
  of a ghostly bell heard as far as Hillsfar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mulmaster.</em></strong> Sixteen wealthy nobles called the Council of Blades rule the
  unabashedly imperialist Moonsea city of Mulmaster. At their disposal are the Hawks, a clandestine
  group of spies and assassins; the Cloaks, Mulmaster’s official mage guild; and the Soldiery, the
  city’s armed forces. The Church of Bane is Mulmaster’s dominant faith.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Point Iron.</em></strong> The dwarven iron mine known as Point Iron was taken over by
  duergar more than a century ago. In their mining, the duergar found gold, which they craft into
  fabulous jewelry that fetches exorbitant prices throughout the Moonsea and
  <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a>. This trade has also given the psychic duergar access to powerful
  individuals they can bring under their mental control.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Quivering Forest.</em></strong> For a time, travelers who entered the Quivering Forest
  emerged in Barovia, a Domain of Dread within the Shadowfell (described in
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/cos">Curse of Strahd</a> and
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/vrgtr">Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</a>). The mists
  of Barovia have since cleared, but terrifying werewolves, vampires, and other creatures from that
  realm still haunt these woods. Barovia’s influence has even granted new powers to Jeny Greenteeth,
  a legendary hag of the forest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Thar.</em></strong> Valiant orcs fight to defend their territory from ogres,
  manticores, and perytons in the rocky moorland known as the Thar. Eons ago, this land was a
  unified orc kingdom. Legend has it that Vorbyx’s Hammer, a great weapon carried by the first king
  of Thar, lies hidden somewhere here. Thar’s orcs believe that the next orc to wield it will
  restore the kingdom to its former glory.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Zhentil Keep.</em></strong> Once the seat of
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a> power across
  Faerûn, Zhentil Keep was razed over a hundred years ago by Shadovar forces. Eventually the Zhents
  returned and rebuilt it. Zhentil Keep is again a flourishing trade city, but Zhentarim leaders
  have been slow to return there. Zhentarim soldiers are sent to Zhentil Keep for training, and the
  governing council is conspiring to regain influence in the Moonsea from rivals Hillsfar and
  Mulmaster.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Sembia">Sembia</h4>
<p>
  The young realm of Sembia aggressively pursues both trade and territorial expansion. Merchant
  councils govern many of its cities, from gothic Saerloon to lavish Selgaunt. Sembians relish the
  art of negotiation, and coins create friendships fast here. But the lack of coins makes those
  friends disappear just as quickly. Outside Sembia’s cities, orchards, vineyards, and farms sprawl
  throughout the realm’s countryside.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ordulin.</em></strong> Half a century ago, a dale called Moondale enjoyed a prosperous
  trade relationship with neighboring Sembian cities before being peacefully annexed into Sembia. It
  was renamed Ordulin and now serves as Sembia’s capital. Every seven years, the merchant councils
  of Sembia’s other cities convene and appoint an Overmaster from their ranks to govern Sembia from
  Ordulin. They have gone to great lengths to foster Sembian pride in the city and erase its
  cultural roots as a former dale.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheHeartlands">Life in the Heartlands</h4>
<p>
  Some of Faerûn’s greatest threats and most inspiring alliances have sprung up in the
  <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a>. These histories influence the region to this day.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dragons.</em></strong> Dragons were the first occupants of the Heartlands, before even
  the elves of Cormanthor, and dozens of active dragon lairs litter the wilds, as do countless
  remnants of long-abandoned lairs. The <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a> region sees much dragon
  activity; its sea was even once called the Sea of Dragons. <a href="#Cormyr">Cormyr</a> has seen a
  recent uptick in dragon attacks from the Storm Horns, and the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#CultOfTheDragon">Cult of the Dragon</a> is
  steadily gaining influence in <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Expansionism.</em></strong> While cities of the
  <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a> and the North enjoy relative harmony among each other, the
  same can’t be said for the realms of the <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a>.
  <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> and <a href="#Cormyr">Cormyr</a> have expanded relentlessly over the
  centuries and taken turns encroaching on each other’s territories. The
  <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a>’s leaders ruthlessly control their individual cities and plot to
  overthrow each other to grab more power. The Dalelands sits in the middle of it all, trying to
  avoid the attention of realms and factions that would eagerly invade the dales if it wasn’t so
  difficult to march an army through the forest of Cormanthor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Pools of Radiance.</em></strong> Pools of radiance are open wounds in the
  Weave—powerful, naturally occurring fonts of raw magic. The water of these pools shimmers and
  shines with an unearthly glow. Nearly all of Faerûn’s pools of radiance are in the
  <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a> region. Several evil entities throughout Faerûn’s history
  have found ways to channel the immense power of the pools—especially the pool of radiance beneath
  the <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a> town of Phlan—to enact devastating rituals. A pool of radiance
  can be destroyed only with an artifact called the <em>Gauntlets of Moander</em>, but its
  whereabouts are unknown.

  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  The Lands of Intrigue maintain civil relations with each other, even as they jostle for authority
  over Faerûn’s commerce. Though <a href="#Amn">Amn</a>, <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a>, and
  <a href="#Tethyr">Tethyr</a> might not have raised swords against each other in the last few
  hundred years, they’ve spied on each other, made aggressive trade deals, and exchanged land with
  each other in delicate dances of thinly veiled mistrust.
</p>
<p>Each realm grapples with its own internal web of intrigue. Merchant houses ally with and pit</p>
<p>
  themselves against each other in dizzying configurations to assert their influence over
  <a href="#Amn">Amn</a>. Questions of bloodline and right to rule swirl around the queen of
  <a href="#Tethyr">Tethyr</a>. The four genie factions of
  <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a> bristle at the increasing self-reliance of the realm’s
  folk—especially Sultana Songal, Calimshan’s ruler.
</p>
<p>
  Adventures in these lands often play out against a backdrop of political machination. Characters
  might hobnob with influential nobles at galas, strike backdoor bargains in seedy undercities, or
  spy on one noble genie while working for another. Perhaps they’ll infiltrate the Shadow Thieves, a
  network whose meddling is felt throughout the Lands of Intrigue.
</p>
<p>
  Each of the three realms in the Lands of Intrigue has at least one active port city and trade
  routes to go along with it. News travels as swiftly as goods, but deserts, forests, and mountain
  ranges make it difficult for armies to cross from one realm to another.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Amn">Amn</h4>
<p>
  No realm in Faerûn is wealthier than Amn. Unlike their neighbors—which pursue wealth for the
  comfort it brings—Amnians seek and spend wealth as a symbol of status. Amn’s governing body is the
  anonymous Council of Five, said to consist of the heads of Amn’s most influential merchant
  families. Open worship of Cyric is legal here, thanks to deep ties between the Church of Cyric and
  the council, and Amn has long had imperial ambitions. Spellcasting, on the other hand, is
  forbidden. The law permits only priests of Cyric and the Cowled Wizards— specialized mages in
  service to Amn’s merchant houses—to use magic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Athkatla.</em></strong> Athkatla, the City of Coin, is the capital city of Amn and a
  place of vast riches. Things illegal, immoral, and despicable pass without comment in this busy
  port city so long as the price is right. The Council of Five rules from a fortress here called the
  Council House.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cloud Peaks.</em></strong> The Cloud Peaks teem with iron, precious metal, and
  gems—but also with remorhazes and white dragons. Frost giants sometimes scale the mountains’ crags
  for ceremonies or games.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Esmeltaran.</em></strong> Amnian nobles and wealthy tourists flock to the beautiful
  city of Esmeltaran during the winter months to bask in the warmth of Lake Esmel’s hot springs. A
  young copper dragon has begun pulling pranks on the lake’s visitors, who mistake the dragon for a
  legendary monster of the lake named Esmelda.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Myth Lharast.</em></strong> The city of Myth Lharast was sacred to Selûne for three
  centuries, home to benevolent lycanthropes as well as elves and other folk. Protected by a
  powerful mythal, it nevertheless fell to internal dissent many centuries ago. As evil wizards and
  their undead and elemental minions conquered the city, Selûne removed Myth Lharast from the world,
  placing it in a demiplane. Now the city can be accessed only when the moon is full.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Orgoth’s Tower.</em></strong> Hubris claimed Orgoth the Tainted, a prodigious wizard
  who summoned three unruly fiends and died at their hands. Rumor has it that his spellbook, the
  <em>Alcaith</em>, still lies in Orgoth’s Tower. Elves of the Shilmista Forest warn against
  searching for it, since the three fiends are rumored to still haunt the tower’s halls.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Small Teeth.</em></strong> To the south, temples of Cyric called the Twin Towers of
  the Eternal Eclipse sit high on each side of the Small Teeth mountains’ central pass. The ancient
  blue dragonIryklathagra, also called “Sharpfangs,” sleeps deep within the Small Teeth, awakening
  once a century. Killing the dragon is a fool’s errand; instead, adventurers try to loot the many
  hoards scattered throughout her sprawling lair.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Snakewood.</em></strong> Priests of Eldath inhabit Duskwood Dell in the
  serpent-infested Snakewood. Two years ago, a conniving beholder named Sersentrych slew the green
  dragon Ringreemeralxoth and moved into his lair. Sersentrych has since indoctrinated the dragon’s
  hatchlings into loyal servitude.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Troll Mountains.</em></strong> Trolls aren’t the only dangers in the Troll Mountains.
  Balagos “the Flying Flame,” an ancient red dragon feared throughout the
  <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a>, lairs in the extinct Smokespire volcano. The
  Gulf of Storms, a lightning-wracked canyon and pilgrimage site for worshipers of Talos, lies
  nearby. Wind whistles through the hollow eyes, ears, and mouth of the Wailing Dwarf, a mile-high
  mountainside carved to depict an enormous dwarf. An abandoned, ooze-infested dwarven city lies
  beneath this monument and is the setting for <em>Lancameth’s Last Expedition</em>, a famous ballad
  detailing the death of Bryam Lancameth and his four companions, armed with potent magic items that
  have never been recovered.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Calimshan">Calimshan</h4>
<p>
  Tradition and innovation coexist in Calimshan under the reign of Sultana Songal. Calimshan’s
  people have a fraught and complex relationship with the realm’s four genie factions. The genies
  have both subjugated and fought alongside the people of Calimshan at various points in the realm’s
  ten-thousand-year history. While Calishites of the desert and other wilderness areas rely on genie
  magic for survival, inhabitants of Calimport have instead embraced and improved on innovations
  from <a href="#Lantan">Lantan</a>, resulting in a new wave of [magicitems]Mechanical
  Wonder;Mechanical Wonders[/magicitems] that have transformed city life.
</p>
<p>
  Calimshan has the largest population of genasi (described in
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/motm"
    >Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a
  >) of any realm in Faerûn; some of these genasi live among the realm’s people, while others reside
  with the four genie factions. See chapter 4 of
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/dnd/fraif">Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</a> for
  more on Calimshan.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Alimir Mountains.</em></strong> Calimshan fought back against beholders from the
  Alimir Mountains thousands of years ago in a series of conflicts called the Eye Tyrant Wars.
  Nearly fifty beholders live together in a massive hive in those mountains today, biding their time
  while rebuilding their numbers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Calim Desert.</em></strong> Eons ago, when the immortal genies Calim and Memnon were
  imprisoned in the [magicitems]Calimemnon Crystal[/magicitems], the magical backlash transformed
  the surrounding environs into the inhospitable Calim Desert. Wild magic and sandstorms wreak havoc
  here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Calimport.</em></strong> Calimshan’s capital city Calimport is among the oldest cities
  in Faerûn. This famous trade hub teems with wonders magical and mechanical. Genies must swear a
  magically binding pact with Sultana Songal, called the Sultana’s Oath, to enter the city. Cults,
  criminals, and illicit markets lurk in the Muzad, Calimport’s undercity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Forest of Mir.</em></strong> The Forest of Mir hides Myth Dyraalis, a thriving city
  with deep ties to both the Feywild and the plane of Arborea. A powerful mythal allows only those
  with fey ancestry to see this so-called Phantom City. Nearby lies Dallnothax: a mostly
  subterranean settlement devoted to Vhaeraun, a drow god of thievery.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Genie Strongholds.</em></strong> The four genie factions of Calimshan lair in
  fantastic strongholds scattered around the realm. The dao fortress of Olympus Dag stands in the
  Marching Mountains; the marid city of Maran Saya lies deep beneath the waves of the Shining Sea;
  the flying djinni city of Burin Bir and its trailing palaces drift above the Forest of Mir; and
  the efreeti fortress of Gozva Ka stands in the Calim Desert, hidden with shimmering illusions.
  These palaces are ruled by noble genies and are also home to a variety of aides and servitors who
  are adapted to the genies’ preferred environments.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Marching Mountains.</em></strong> The Marching Mountains house the remains of the
  First Necropolis of Nykkar: an ancient site where early Calishites prepared their revered dead for
  burial.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nykkar, Isle of Memory.</em></strong> In more modern times, Calishites have
  established many mausoleums and cemeteries in a necropolis on the so-called Isle of Memory, named
  Nykkar after the ancient necropolis in the mountains. Nykkar is maintained by priests of Kelemvor
  and serviced by ships known as the Death Fleet. A crew of engineers maintain a lighthouse on the
  island’s northern tip.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spider Swamp.</em></strong> Zanassu the Spider Demon was vanquished from Calimshan’s
  Spider Swamp on the southern coast long ago, but quasits and other demons still infest this fetid
  area. The swamp is also home to reclusive spider-people known as araneas; so far, araneas have
  remained hidden, using magic to conceal their identity when they enter towns to trade. (Araneas
  are detailed in <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn.</em> )
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Tethyr">Tethyr</h4>
<p>
  Though not as much of a mercantile superpower as its neighbors, Tethyr enjoys a strong
  relationship with the elves of the Wealdath, who shun <a href="#Amn">Amn</a> and trade rare goods
  exclusively with Tethyr. Tethyr is a feudal realm of lords and vassals, and its royal line appeals
  to the divine patronage of Siamorphe, a demigod of nobility, to assert its right to rule. When
  Queen Anais Rhindaun died of old age, her half-niece and adopted daughter, Ysabel Linden, assumed
  the throne. Ysabel has guided Tethyr with a courageous heart and steady hand for three years, but
  she hasn’t received the blessing of Siamorphe. Some of Tethyr’s nobles whisper that Ysabel is too
  far removed from the Rhindaun bloodline—and Siamorphe’s favor—to rule.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Castle Tethyr.</em></strong> Castle Tethyr was the historical home of Tethyr’s royalty
  before it burned down some 150 years ago. Now, an elder beholder named Xithallowthlan schemes
  within the dungeons below the castle. Hundreds of eyes cover Xithallowthlan’s body—a blessing from
  the Great Mother, a patron deity of beholders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Darromar.</em></strong> Queen Ysabel Linden rules the realm of Tethyr from Faerntarn
  Palace in the capital city of Darromar. An aasimar named Saerwyn the Bright has recently arrived
  in Darromar to challenge Ysabel’s right to the throne, claiming to be a child of the demigod
  Siamorphe. Whether Saerwyn is truthful or a pretender remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Forest of Tethyr.</em></strong> Many call the Forest of Tethyr “Wealdath,” an Elvish
  phrase meaning “unspoiled woods.” This vast forest is home to monsters, fey, the peaceful gold
  dragon Garlokantha, and two wood elf tribes: the Suldusk and Elmanesse. The Suldusk have their own
  treetop city, Suldanessellar. The Elmanesse seek to restore the mythal around the
  will-o-wisp-infested elven tomb city of Myth Rhynn.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Omlarandin Mountains.</em></strong> Omlar gems can be found only in the Omlarandin
  Mountains. These rare turquoise gems hold magic like a sponge, making them exceptional components
  for crafting magic items. The demand for omlars among <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a>’s genie
  lords has run most of the mountain’s existing mines dry, prompting miners and adventurers to delve
  ever deeper into the mountain range.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Purple Hills.</em></strong> No one in the
  <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a> makes finer wine than the halflings of the Purple
  Hills, on Tethyr’s southwest coast. These halflings also recently reopened Canaith, a legendary
  bard academy. Bards travel from far and wide to study their craft there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Starspire Mountains.</em></strong> Balagos, a red dragon of the Troll Mountains, keeps
  some of his hoard at a secondary lair called Mount Thargill in the Starspire Mountains. Five years
  ago, Balagos captured a young bronze dragon named Ixolothingeir, tore off his wings, and commanded
  him to guard this lair or die.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Velen.</em></strong> Velen is haunted, but its citizens don’t mind. Many of the city’s
  dead remain there as ghosts for unknown reasons, coexisting with the living. The autonomous Duchy
  of Velen gained its independence from Tethyr in 1424 DR. It maintains a friendly relationship with
  its western neighbor, using its impressive naval fleet to defend itself and Tethyr from Nelanther
  pirates.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheLandsofIntrigue">Life in the Lands of Intrigue</h4>
<p>
  Folk in the <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a> are more interested in politics than
  the mysteries of the lands themselves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nelanther Pirates.</em></strong> Hordes of lizardfolk, ogre, and minotaur pirates
  surge forth from the Nelanther Isles (detailed further in the “<a href="#TracklessSea"
    >Trackless Sea</a
  >” section of this chapter) to raid shipping from the Lands of Intrigue. Merchants from all three
  realms commission adventurers to sail forth into those islands and recover stolen goods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Night Bandits of Erlkazar.</em></strong> The
  <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a>’s eastern reaches suffer raids from the
  neighboring realm of Erlkazar. Armies of vampiric bandits slip into merchant camps and leap over
  city walls in the dead of night. Those who journey to Erlkazar find no trace of these bandits or
  the pilfered goods. The vampiric nature of the Night Bandits remains a secret outside Erlkazar,
  for the locals are too frightened of their vampire masters to betray them to outsiders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Rise and Fall of Muranndin.</em></strong> In the late fourteenth century, an oni
  couple conquered the city of Murann in southwest <a href="#Amn">Amn</a> and founded Muranndin, a
  short-lived empire of marauding orcs and ogres who sought living sacrifices for their gods Gruumsh
  and Vaprak. Amn and <a href="#Tethyr">Tethyr</a>’s forces slew the founders and reclaimed nearly
  all of the land by the late fifteenth century DR. However, the couple’s son—a brooding oni named
  Avasskyth—still rules over the villainous city of Murann. The city is surrounded by a formidable
  wall made of thick, sharpened tree trunks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shadow Thieves of Amn.</em></strong> The ruthless Shadow Thieves began as an ordinary
  thieves’ guild in <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a>. When the Lords of Waterdeep assassinated
  many of the Shadow Thieves’ founding members and drove the rest out, the organization
  reestablished itself in <a href="#Amn">Amn</a>. It thrived in Athkatla, where they became a
  household name and forged covert connections with Amn’s ruling Council of Five. Now, the Shadow
  Thieves pulls strings everywhere in the <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a> and plot
  vengeance on the Lords of Waterdeep. See chapter 6 for more information on the Shadow Thieves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shanatar.</em></strong> Before the
  <a href="#LandsofIntrigue">Lands of Intrigue</a> existed, there was Shanatar. This ancient shield
  dwarf kingdom sprawled across the region’s Underdark and contained eight subkingdoms, each
  dedicated to one of Moradin’s divine children. Duergar and other Underdark invaders brought ruin
  to Shanatar long ago. The only kingdom still standing is Iltkazar, situated beneath the Omlarandin
  Mountains. The god Clangeddin Silverbeard watches over Iltkazar, and a wise ancient silver dragon
  called King Mith Barak rules over the kingdom. Mith Barak seeks the return of the
  [magicitems]Wyrmskull Throne[/magicitems], a powerful Shanatar artifact that went missing eons
  ago.

    the menace of the Underdark.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  Nothing lasts forever in the North. Frost giants, white dragons, and marauders threaten the land,
  and winter is always near, ready to destroy whatever remains. The region was ravaged by the War of
  the Silver Marches—a sweeping conflict between Many-Arrows,
  <a href="#Menzoberranzan">Menzoberranzan</a>, and the cities of the Lords’ Alliance—and again more
  recently by violence between giants. And yet, the North abounds with fertile river valleys,
  mineral deposits, deep forests, and startling natural beauty. It is a wilderness of violent
  extremes, hidden wonders, and isolated strongholds struggling to survive against all odds.
</p>
<p>
  The land is vast, cold, and lawless, and civilization survives only through fear, toil, and blood.
  Independent strongholds act as city-states in loose alliances. Outside fortress walls, farmers,
  prospectors, and settlers eke out hardscrabble lives, while roving nomads do what they must to
  survive while honoring their traditions. Ancient dwarfholds and forest ruins echo with memories of
  vanished realms. People in the North worship fierce gods and fear the freezing dark.
</p>
<p>
  Adventures here focus on survival above all, both individual and communal. Here, adventurers must
  fight off invaders and face natural disasters as they carve out a foothold in an inhospitable
  land. They broker tenuous peace between hostile fortresses, uncover frozen secrets, battle dragons
  and giants, and defy fate to build something that can survive the cold.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#TheNorth">The North</a> is criss-crossed by fragile alliances between independent cities
  and strongholds in loose confederations for mutual aid, defense, and trade. These independent
  city-states look to their own interests first, defending and developing their own resources. They
  cooperate with allies not from fealty or honor, but from shared self-interest and to increase
  their own chances of survival.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</h4>
<p>
  At the far northern end of the <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a>, beyond the Spine of the
  World, lies Icewind Dale. Bounded by the Reghed Glacier to the east and the gnashing maw of the
  Sea of Moving Ice to the north and west, Icewind Dale is a wind-scoured waste marked by the
  solitary peak of Kelvin’s Cairn. The rough-hewn Ten-Towns band together to harvest hidden
  abundance: gems, timber, and the valuable bones of knucklehead trout. Would-be heroes and villains
  alike come to Icewind Dale seeking frost giant artifacts, Underdark wonders, and Netherese
  secrets, but most run afoul of fierce monsters, locals, and priests of Auril—to say nothing of
  chardalyn, a blighted material capable of twisting minds and spirits in pursuit of power. See
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/dnd/fraif">Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</a> for
  more on Icewind Dale.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bryn Shander.</em></strong> Foremost among the Ten-Towns—Icewind Dale’s cluster of
  small settlements—Bryn Shander is the local center of trade and government. It serves as a walled
  refuge for those fleeing nearby towns in times of crisis.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="KingdomofManyArrows">Kingdom of Many-Arrows</h4>
<p>
  Self-crowned King Orrusk Homebringer is working to restore an orc domain in the far north,
  beginning with the shattered fortress of Dark Arrow Keep. The Kingdom of Many-Arrows united the
  disparate orc tribes of the Spine of the World for over a hundred years until it was razed in the
  War of the Silver Marches. Orrusk would see it come into being again, and more orcs arrive every
  day, drawn by his vision of a new, independent orc realm.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheNorthLordsAlliance">Lords’ Alliance</h4>
<p>
  The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a realm, but rather a tenuous but powerful coalition between contentious
  settlements of the North and elsewhere, established to promote peace, prosperity, and security
  among its members. It includes Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Mithral Hall, and others, including
  powerful <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> to the south (see “<a href="#SwordCoast"
    >Sword Coast</a
  >” in this chapter). Each settlement in the alliance looks first to its own interests, then to the
  needs of its allies. The Alliance hires adventurers to investigate and eradicate threats to the
  region and isn’t above using violence and deception in pursuit of its goals. See chapter 6 for
  more information on the Lords’ Alliance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>High Road.</em></strong> A vital lifeline linking settlements along the Sword Coast
  and one of the North’s foremost trade routes, the High Road begins in
  <a href="#Luskan">Luskan</a>, runs south through Neverwinter, and then continues along the coast
  to Waterdeep (where it continues as the Trade Way). After decades of neglect and disrepair, the
  road is again safe to travel thanks to the efforts of Dagult Neverember and the High Road Charter
  Company.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mirabar.</em></strong> The richest city in the North sits on the Mirar River, enclosed
  by sloped outer walls. Above ground, a largely human population is ruled by their hereditary
  marchion, but Mirabar is deeply dwarven. Tunnels, forges, and foundries in the massive undercity
  lead to the great mines of the Sword Coast. Dwarven elders on the Council of Sparkling Stones rule
  underground, and the Axe of Mirabar, a well-armed company of dwarf soldiers, defends the city
  against threats, above or below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Neverwinter.</em></strong> The City of Skilled Hands was once known for its master
  crafters, fine goods, and lavish gardens heated year-round by the Neverwinter River, flowing from
  Mount Hotenow. When the volcano erupted and a great chasm to the Underdark opened, Neverwinter was
  nearly destroyed. Now, with the volcano’s wrath spent and the chasm sealed, the city is rebuilding
  itself under the rule of Lord Dagult Neverember.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Silverymoon.</em></strong> Rightly called the Gem of the North, this quiet,
  cosmopolitan city is a powerful member of the Lords’ Alliance and a haven of learning, music, and
  culture. The Knights in Silver and magical defenses protect the city’s ivy-covered walls and
  towers, where gardens and trees cast dappled light on peaceful streets. For a time, Silverymoon
  was the capital of a tight-knit alliance across the Silver Marches—the region between the
  Glimmerwood and the High Forest. The War of the Silver Marches brought an end to that alliance and
  tarnished Silverymoon’s reputation, but it is still respected and beloved across the region.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Luskan">Luskan</h4>
<p>
  Luskan, the City of Sails, was once a grand port, but years of crime and ill fortune have reduced
  it to a dirty dive with filthy streets, ramshackle docks, and pirates thinly disguised as traders.
  Rising above its stinking fog like a clawed hand is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of the
  Arcane Brotherhood (described in chapter 6). Five pirate lords called High Captains rule the city
  and are charged with the city’s defense and legitimate trade, as well as plundering the
  Northlander islands to the west.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Menzoberranzan">Menzoberranzan</h4>
<p>
  Menzoberranzan is a drow city carved from the pillars of a great cavern in the Underdark between
  Silverymoon and Mithral Hall. It is the center of Lolth’s worship in Faerûn. Also known as the
  City of Spiders, it’s known for its culture of deception, manipulation, and the capture and trade
  of enslaved surface dwellers. Although officially governed by a council of matrons from the eight
  greatest houses, the city is under the heel of House Baenre and the Matron Mother, who rules in
  Lolth’s name. On a high plateau stands the Academy, Tier Breche, where priestesses, mages, and
  noble warriors are trained. Over a hundred tunnels link the city to other parts of the Underdark,
  and drow traders sell poisons, strange mushrooms, beasts of burden, scrolls, wine, and secrets
  with merchants of the deep.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="NorthernDwarfholds">Northern Dwarfholds</h4>
<p>
  Throughout the North, many dwarves dwell in independent fortresses called dwarfholds. Though many
  such dwarfholds are lost, abandoned, or infested by monsters, some still stand firm. Dwarves in
  Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Gauntlgrym, Stoneshaft Hold, and Ironmaster trace
  their ancestry back to Delzoun, the ancient dwarf kingdom of the North. Mirabar and Sundabar are
  also dwarfholds, though Mirabar has welcomed human immigrants and Sundabar was razed by the
  <a href="#KingdomofManyArrows">Kingdom of Many-Arrows</a> in the War of the Silver Marches. Before
  then, most dwarfholds had joined the Lords’ Alliance, but when Silverymoon failed to save
  Sundabar, the dwarfhold leaders declared their intention to rely only on one another.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Citadel Adbar.</em></strong> Citadel Adbar is a fortress in the Ice Mountains built by
  the dwarves of ancient Delzoun that has defied invaders for eighteen centuries. The War of the
  Silver Marches reduced the city’s once-great Knights of the Mithral Shield to a handful of
  members, but its defending army—the Iron Guard—remains strong.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gauntlgrym.</em></strong> Once a bastion of Delzoun, Gauntlgrym lay abandoned under
  the mountains for centuries until King Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed it from Lolth’s followers
  with an army of shield dwarves. The heart of Gauntlgrym is its legendary forge, within which is
  trapped a fire elemental known as Maegera the Dawn Titan.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mithral Hall.</em></strong> The ancestral home of the Battlehammer clan is a
  nigh-impregnable vault beneath the Frost Hills. Despite its almost mythic reputation, Mithral Hall
  is more of a stronghold than a city, with tunnels to other dwarfholds deep below its mines. Queen
  Dagnabbet Waybeard rules Mithral Hall, firmly in support of the Lords’ Alliance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sundabar.</em></strong> Like its sibling-city, Mirabar, Sundabar was both an
  underground dwarfhold and a thriving surface city until it was razed by Many-Arrows orcs in the
  War of the Silver Marches. Refugees from the surface city fled west to Silverymoon and other
  nearby settlements, while the dwarves of the lower holds withdrew from the Lords’ Alliance and
  banned outsiders from the city. While the walls and buildings of the city above crumble into ruins
  stalked by roving monsters, black smoke rises from tunnels and hidden chambers, where underground
  forges still operate.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SavageFrontier">Savage Frontier</h4>
<p>
  The Savage Frontier is a vast swath of ungoverned land inhabited by dangerous monsters. Visitors
  can trudge for days through its peaks and snowfields without seeing so much as a trapper’s cabin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Evermoors.</em></strong> An unsettled region of fog-shrouded hills, cold bogs, rocky
  ridges, small peaks, and crumbling ruins, this vast waste is inhabited by hill giants, ettins,
  ogres, countless trolls, and warring bands of orcs. A mile above the Evermoors floats the cloud
  giant castle of Lyn Armaal, only fleetingly glimpsed through overcast skies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Glimmerwood.</em></strong> This wide forest combines the dense, lycanthrope-prowled
  Moonwood, the Druarwood (claimed by Uthgardt tribes), and the Cold Wood, which is covered by ice
  and snow even during the height of summer, except where blackened by traveling fire giants.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>High Forest.</em></strong> The greatest existing forest in Faerûn is vast and
  mysterious, a remnant from ages past, when elven realms like Illefarn and Eaerlann ruled a
  continent covered in green. The High Forest is as large as a realm, covering mountains and
  countless secrets. Here dwell treants of enormous size, stags with antlers wide as a wagon,
  gigantic bears, owlbears, wolves, centaurs, unicorns, and other creatures stranger still, some of
  which have no name remembered by mortals. The forest’s outermost fringes are inhabited by
  woodcutters and outlaws, but deeper in, wood elves and Uthgardt warriors of the Ghost Tree tribe
  guard the forest’s secrets.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Icespire Peak.</em></strong> Icespire Peak is the tallest of the Sword Mountains,
  visible from far away as Phandalin. The mountain conceals mithral mines dug by dwarves long ago,
  and in winter its waterfalls freeze, forming amazing curtains of ice. But Icespire Peak is now
  home to goblins, frost giants, trolls, the white dragon Cryovain, and agents of the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#CultOfTheDragon">Cult of the Dragon</a>,
  ensuring all but brave adventurers avoid its perilous slopes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mere of Dead Men.</em></strong> Thousands of dwarf, elf, human, and orc corpses lie
  beneath this saltwater swamp, which was created many centuries ago through fell magic. The swamp
  is home to two ancient black dragons: Voaraghamanthar the Black Death and his twin brother
  Waervaerendor the Rapacious Raider. The two dragons share a psychic link and are
  indistinguishable, so they’re often mistaken for a single dragon. Efforts to drain the swamp or
  redirect the High Road away from its borders have been fruitless; the swamp merely expands to fill
  any abandoned space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Phandalin.</em></strong> The frontier settlement of Phandalin has a long history of
  association with mages and artificers working in the nearby complex of Wave Echo Cave, home to the
  legendary Forge of Spells. Fragments of Netherese civilization also dot this region, including
  pieces of psychic crystal. Mind flayers lairing in the Underdark beneath Phandalin collect these
  crystals and use them to mutate innocent victims in an elaborate scheme to create a new empire in
  Faerûn.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheNorth">Life in the North</h4>
<p>
  To live in the North requires strength—strength of body to withstand the harsh elements, strength
  of will to withstand fear and isolation, and strength of heart to stand side by side with
  strangers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Giants and Dragons.</em></strong> In other parts of Faerûn, people tell stories about
  the conflicts between giants and dragons. In the North, these are lived realities. Many giants and
  dragons dwell here at the edge of the world, and their ancient enmity threatens those who dwell
  peacefully in the shadow of the mountains.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nomads.</em></strong> The Reghed nomads of <a href="#IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a> and
  the Uthgardt of the <a href="#SavageFrontier">Savage Frontier</a> survive through hardiness and
  mobility, proving that it’s possible to flourish even in the deadliest of lands. Some, however,
  depend on raiding and violence to survive.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spine of the World.</em></strong> This impossibly high mountain range spans the entire
  north, shaping and threatening the entire region. Towering black rock peaks are gripped by snow
  and ice, scoured by raging winds, and filled with yetis, white dragons, and frost giants, while
  tunnels, caves, and abandoned dwarfholds below are home to goblinoids, remorhazes, duergar, and
  drow. In the jaws of these mountains lie the crumbling ruins and secrets of too many
  half-forgotten realms and lost souls to count.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Underdark Menace.</em></strong> Threats from deep below the earth’s surface are never
  far from the minds of folk in the North. Drow worshipers of Lolth dwell in great numbers in the
  Underdark, aberrations lurk in caverns deeper still, and buried secrets have a way of turning up
  in frightening ways. Worse still, in <a href="#IcewindDale">Icewind Dale</a>, mysterious forces
  have begun to thaw the frozen deep, freeing horrors deep beneath subterranean ice that should
  never be released.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Winter’s Reign.</em></strong> However dragons and giants might rage, there is no power
  greater than the winter in the far North. Life here is geared toward withstanding hardship.
  Traders throughout the region supply winter gear and spirits strong enough to warm bones and numb
  wounds. Builders create thick-walled shelters that stand against the strongest winds. Priests
  placate gods of cold, such as Auril, and pray to deities willing to grant one more breath, one
  more glimpse of the sun, to the faithful.

<p>
  The realms of the Old Empires are the most ancient extant civilizations in Faerûn. For over three
  thousand years the people of <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a>,
  <a href="#Chessenta">Chessenta</a>, and <a href="#Unther">Unther</a> have alternately flourished
  and floundered, rising to unparalleled heights and surviving unprecedented disasters. The result
  is three realms that share wide swaths of history and aspects of culture peculiar to outsiders:
  strict theocratic governments,
</p>
<p>enormous military-bureaucracy complexes, and unique advances in art, science, and magic.</p>
<p>
  Those who make the perilous voyage across the Sea of Fallen Stars and into Old Empires ports find
  desert coasts dusted with glittering purple sand; beachside bazaars overflowing with turquoise,
  lapis lazuli, and bronze metalcraft; and terraced temple gardens bursting with grapes, dates, and
  figs. Further inland, limestone monoliths loom over oceans of ripe grain next to unspeakably
  impoverished slum-cities; flooded riverside ruins and parched savanna fortresses teem with desert
  monsters; and battlegrounds lay haunted by restless dead—including previous incarnations of the
  gods themselves.
</p>
<p>
  With their alien deities, inscrutable technology, and ancient grudges, the Old Empires are unlike
  any other region of the Forgotten Realms. To explorers and mercenaries from foreign soil,
  Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta are realms teeming with mysteries. For locals of these lands,
  opportunities abound to become heroes either by confronting the desert’s dangers or shedding light
  on corrupt powers. No matter who answers the call, the Old Empires promise priceless rewards for
  the brave, beneficial secrets for the cunning, and exciting adventures for all.
</p>
<p>
  The story of the Old Empires begins with an empire called Imaskar, whose high artificers and
  overlords facilitated their kingdom’s ascension by subjugating tens of thousands of people from a
  distant world. The abused subjects beseeched their patron deities for freedom, and their prayers
  were answered. The Imaskar underclass liberated itself, and in place of overthrown Imaskar the
  people founded two new empires: Mulhorand and Unther.
</p>
<p>
  Though they share similar origins, Mulhorand and Unther have harbored mutual animosity toward one
  another since their founding. Their constant territorial disputes eventually birthed the
  independent realm of Chessenta to the northwest.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Chessenta">Chessenta</h4>
<p>
  Chessenta is an unusual empire, where a chaotic array of city-states are in perpetual conflict
  with one another. But where constant strife might weaken lesser realms, Chessenta’s endless saber
  rattling and infighting only tempers an already resilient people.
</p>
<p>
  Chessentans revel in war the way other cultures delight in sports or feasting. In Chessenta, a
  youth’s first brush with death is a rite of passage, and a life without battle is no life at all.
  Chessentans who don’t take part in their city’s bloody military campaigns toil at home to supply
  the army, growing drought-resistant crops in the thin and stony soil, forging sturdy but
  lightweight weapons and shields suitable for the hot summer wars, and producing thousands of
  barrels of the region’s famous ruby wine to keep soldiers’ spirits high.
</p>
<p>
  [skill]Religion[/skill] is important in Chessenta, and Chessentans have an array of gods and
  demigods utterly alien to outsiders. But perhaps no deity in Chessenta is so noteworthy as
  Tchazzar, a legendary god-king who in antiquity united the city-states of Chessenta and
  spearheaded the realm’s only golden age. Tchazzar’s death four hundred years ago heralded a great
  schism between the Chessentan cities. Only recently has the violent deity returned to Faerûnian
  soil in his true form as the Great Red Dragon. After reclaiming and subjugating the city of
  Cimbar, Tchazzar now aims to reunite the fractious powers of Chessenta into his idealized warrior
  realm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Airspur.</em></strong> The city of Airspur drifts above the shores of Wizards’ Reach
  on an island of floating stone. Its populace includes a higher-than-average percentage of orcs and
  genasi (described in
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/motm"
    >Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a
  >). Its theocratic rulers—the Church of Bhaelros—demand monthly sacrifices to appease their bloody
  god. The flying city uses its aerial advantage to harry its longstanding political rival, Cimbar,
  to the east. If not for Cimbar’s divine ruler, Tchazzar, Airspur likely would’ve already destroyed
  its age-old foe.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cimbar.</em></strong> The former capital of united Chessenta, Cimbar remains one of
  the fragmented empire’s largest metropolises. The city is Tchazzar’s seat of power. Naturally,
  given Tchazzar’s draconic nature, the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#CultOfTheDragon">Cult of the Dragon</a> has
  a strong foothold here. Though it is a blood-soaked and perilous port of call, Cimbar boasts one
  of the largest navies in the whole Inner Sea region. It also hosts famous non-military
  institutions such as the University, the greatest center of higher learning in the Old Empires.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Luthcheq.</em></strong> Military zeal combines with religious fervor in Luthcheq,
  whose ruling Karanok family persecutes practitioners of arcane magic in the name of Entropy, a
  strange god of alien intellect that resides somewhere in the vast underground chasms beneath
  Luthcheq’s undercity. Dozens, if not hundreds, of magically gifted refugees flee Luthcheq each
  year to escape this destructive cult.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Threskel.</em></strong> South of the dormant volcano known as Mount Thulbane and north
  of the Riders to the Sky lies the sparsely populated land of Threskel. Chessenta and Unther both
  claim Threskel, but this remote land is famously lorded over by evil dragons. The few people who
  live in Threskel eke out pitiful existences on barren farms nestled between rocky shores and
  windswept cliffs. The desperation of this land has given rise to many heroic adventurers whom the
  dragons eagerly squash.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Mulhorand">Mulhorand</h4>
<p>
  Mulhorand is the oldest of the Old Empires and was literally shaped by gods. Deities from a
  distant world—gods with names like Anhur, Horus-Re, and Set—took on physical form, leading their
  people to settle in rich, densely populated metropolises and build massive stone pyramids. To this
  day, these incarnated deities continue to walk the land and directly influence the realm.
</p>
<p>
  While pharaohs with divine lineage ultimately rule the realm, Mulhorand is governed by a class of
  powerful theocrats: high priests, sages, and holy warriors who serve the incarnated gods. All
  Mulhorandi, from blue-blooded nobles to common street peddlers, heed their god-kings’ wishes in
  every aspect of daily life. When a merchant’s latest shipment arrives safely at port, it is thanks
  to the will of Nephthys; a new mother’s safe delivery might personally be overseen by Hathor; and
  Mulhorandi commanders pray to Anhur, General of the Gods, for victory against Untherites who
  threaten their borders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Great Vale.</em></strong> The breadbasket of Mulhorand produces enough barley,
  lentils, and onions to feed millions of the empire’s citizens; it is also the realm’s primary
  source of papyrus. Large bronze pumps—just one of Mulhorand’s advanced technologies—move water
  from the River of Spears to irrigate the valley’s vast farms. To the east, the Dragonsword
  Mountains cast their shadows over the Great Vale; the empire’s pharaohs and greatest high priests
  are buried among the foothills of these mountains. Marking these crypts are dozens of monuments
  and elaborate tombs—ancient step pyramids and towering obelisks—collectively known as the Land of
  the Dead.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>River of Swords.</em></strong> This long river is the current border between Mulhorand
  and <a href="#Unther">Unther</a>. A perennial battleground, the River of Swords sustains few
  settlements along its bloodstained banks. Most of the river’s water is too salty to drink or water
  crops. In the small city of Sekras there is a machine that pumps water from the river and filters
  out the salt; only a handful of priests of Thoth know how to operate the pump. Occupation of
  Sekras has traded hands so many times that even its few permanent residents scarcely know which
  empire—if any—they currently serve.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Skuld.</em></strong> Anyone wishing to experience Mulhorandi culture in its most
  realized form visits the metropolis of Skuld. The so-called City of Shadows has the noteworthy
  distinction of being the oldest continually inhabited city in Faerûn. Its central district is
  called the City of the Gods; here, incarnations of Mulhorand’s god-kings live in grand temples
  that overlook lush gardens that produce delicious fruit and courtyards of gilded statues.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Unther">Unther</h4>
<p>
  Though they share a common origin story, <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a> and Unther are vastly
  different realms. Whereas some might call Mulhorand paradise, most of Unther is nothing less than
  a hellscape. As one sage wrote, “the society of Unther is one of the most miserable tyrannies that
  the Realms have ever known.” It is a land defined by violence—an ever-shifting territory of fiery
  war camps, poisoned rivers, and salted battlefields where soldiers commit unspeakable atrocities
  in the name of their realm. Mercenaries might find their fortune serving in the armies of Unther,
  but the cost is no less than one’s own soul.
</p>
<p>
  The patron god-king of Unther, Gilgeam, is largely to blame for the realm’s state. Whereas the
  god-kings of Mulhorand treat their realm with benign neglect, Gilgeam is neither benign nor
  neglectful. Cruel and vindictive, he forbids the worship of any other deity. He justifies his
  violence by attributing it to fate, a force he insists even he, a god, is beholden to. It was
  Gilgeam who led Unther to its present state of corruption and chaos. There was a short era of
  relative peace without the dread god, but that time has ended, and Gilgeam now leads a new
  generation of lambs to the slaughter. Already Unther is once more a realm of violent dysfunction,
  maintained by the brute force of Gilgeam and the raw willpower of his most devoted followers, a
  class of violent hoplites, holy warriors, and warlocks called the Children of Gilgeam.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Black Ash Plain.</em></strong> This wasteland of infertile soil takes its name from
  the embers and ash that perpetually rain down from the volcanoes of the nearby Smoking Mountains.
  From the blighted earth jut brutalist ruins—vestiges of Ancient Mulhorand and even earlier
  empires. The ruins magically shift across the desert of their own accord. Those who brave the
  ruins’ subterranean depths find themselves in an ever-transforming maze of basalt corridors and
  granite columns engraved with eerie glyphs that resemble no known language.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Djerad Thymar.</em></strong> The fortress-city called Djerad Thymar was the capital of
  Tymanchebar, an empire of dragonborn that was transported from its home world of Abeir to Toril
  during the Spellplague and fused with Unther to form the new realm of Tymanther. With Unther’s
  return in the Second Sundering, the armies of Unther have shattered the power of Tymanther, but
  Djerad Thymar still stands. With its awe-inspiring stone architecture (the city is carved into the
  face of a mountain) and its vast arts districts, Djerad Thymar is a bastion for draconic culture
  and a mark of great pride for dragonborn.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Messemprar.</em></strong> The large city of Messemprar is by far the finest and most
  hospitable settlement in Unther. Not coincidentally, it is also the only city not presently under
  the thumb of Gilgeam. Instead, a coalition of anti-Gilgeam mages called the North Wizards controls
  the settlement. The North Wizards foster a brand of democracy otherwise unknown in the Old
  Empires. A prime port, Messemprar is beset on all sides by would-be conquerors: war ships from
  <a href="#Chessenta">Chessenta</a>, the armies of <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a>, and
  freebooting Inner Sea pirates from lands abroad. Sturdy adventurers are in constant demand to
  protect the city’s independence.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Unthalass.</em></strong> Supposedly, Unthalass was once the greatest city in the
  Realms: a paradise of flowering gardens, alabaster statues, and palatial limestone manors. Anyone
  who visits the city as it is now would scarcely believe such legends. Everything here has been
  sacrificed in the name of the god-king Gilgeam’s hunger for conquest. The mud-brick streets
  overflow with filth and even blood, for Gilgeam brooks no dissent within his capital. The tyrant
  himself rules all of <a href="#Unther">Unther</a> from an imposing granite fortress in Unthalass
  called the Citadel of Black Ash.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheOldEmpires">Life in the Old Empires</h4>
<p>
  Those visiting the Old Empires are often surprised by the realms’ different cultural values, their
  unique architecture and customs, and the unforgiving southern climate. For natives of the Old
  Empires, these are simply facts of life.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ancient History.</em></strong> <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a>,
  <a href="#Chessenta">Chessenta</a>, and <a href="#Unther">Unther</a> are unfathomably old—and they
  are built atop the ruins of realms even older still. Most notably, Mulhorand and Unther are
  inheritors of the Imaskar Empire. To this day, countless ruins of Imaskar are strewn across the
  region, awaiting discovery by brave adventurers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Insular Realms.</em></strong> The people of the Old Empires care little for the
  concerns of greater Faerûn. Rulers and commoners alike consider themselves and their kingdoms far
  above the juvenile concerns of younger realms. The denizens of
  <a href="#Mulhorand">Mulhorand</a> and <a href="#Unther">Unther</a> justify this point of view by
  citing the gods and godly descendants that have shaped their empires to an extent virtually
  unknown in other parts of the Realms. (Chessentans, for their part, simply view other cultures as
  weak and cowardly.) Further, rulers in the Old Empires are too concerned with their own internal
  power struggles to consider much beyond the horizon.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Living Gods.</em></strong> Unlike most Faerûnian deities, the deities of the Old
  Empires regularly assume tangible, readily perceivable forms. This allows the god-kings of these
  realms to take an active role in their followers’ affairs. These deities deliver divine mandates
  personally and issue decrees that offer little room for doubt about the gods’ motives or
  intentions. Because of this, priests in the Old Empires tend to function more like bureaucrats or
  law enforcers than spiritual guides.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Technology and Magic.</em></strong> The people of the Old Empires are masters of
  unusual technology and forms of magic seen nowhere else in Faerûn. Some of these secrets they
  inherited from Imaskari mages called artificers. Others are simply a result of unique Mulhorandi
  or Untherite genius. Examples include bronze water pumps and mass water purification spells that
  enable the transfer and filtration of precious water, and sail-powered sand sleds and
  easy-to-learn flotation spells allowing travelers to glide on desert winds over vast distances.

<p>
  The lands around and between the two coastal cities of <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> and
  <a href="#BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</a> have been tested relentlessly over the past century,
  enduring the rise and fall of draconic and elemental cults, the scheming of illithids and dead
  gods, and even being dragged into the Nine Hells.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike most of Faerûn’s territorial governments, the Sword Coast’s city-states have no interest
  whatsoever in quarreling over land disputes. The Lords’ Alliance ensures that both the Sword
  Coast’s and the North’s major settlements keep their attention squarely directed at mutual
  threats.
</p>
<p>
  The Sword Coast boasts some of the most cosmopolitan cities in Faerûn. In a city like
  <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> or Baldur’s Gate, a visitor might pass a dragonborn ombudsman,
  an aasimar merchant, and a goliath lutist all in the span of a city block. Even in smaller
  villages, people hold few prejudices and tend to be more receptive to new ideas than in places
  like the stubborn <a href="#Heartlands">Heartlands</a> or the more isolationist isles of the
  <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds
  and explore long-lost ruins. The Sword Coast’s enormous cities also serve as useful sites for
  urban-based adventures, where characters unearth the machinations of scheming nobles or shady
  factions.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SwordCoastLordsAlliance">Lords’ Alliance</h4>
<p>
  The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a true realm, but rather a loose coalition of cities, including
  <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a>, Baldur’s Gate, Daggerford, and Amphail in the
  <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a>. It also includes several cities in Faerûn’s North, such as
  Neverwinter (see “<a href="#TheNorth">The North</a>” in this chapter). Each member of the Lords’
  Alliance keeps its own interests in mind first and foremost. But these cities also agree to
  maintain trade ties with each other, uphold a mutual peace, and band together against common
  threats. Without the Lords’ Alliance, many of western Faerûn’s great cities would have long ago
  fallen to outside threats.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</h4>
<p>
  The grim, crowded city of Baldur’s Gate sits alongside the River Chionthar. Its nobles, called
  patriars, reside in the Upper City while most of the rest of the populace lives in the Lower City.
  Refugees and the destitute make what homes they can in the Outer City. A short way to the east
  sits the walled district of Little <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a>, a thriving neighborhood of
  immigrants from that southern realm. The Council of Four governs Baldur’s Gate, led by Grand Duke
  Ulder Ravengard. See chapter 6 of
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/dnd/fraif">Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</a> for
  more on Baldur’s Gate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Criminal Underworld.</em></strong> Baldur’s Gate has a shady underworld organization
  known as the Guild. It operates throughout the city under the discreet leadership of a crime boss
  named Nine-Fingers Keene. She has agents throughout Baldur’s Gate, including in the city’s banking
  network.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Dead Three.</em></strong> The gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul share a common history
  linked to the city of Baldur’s Gate, where they are known as the Dead Three. All three gods began
  as mortals, claimed a share of the power of the death god Jergal, and died during the Time of
  Troubles. All three have returned, and their worshipers have made a resurgence in Baldur’s Gate
  and the surrounding area, hiding away in the shadows of society. Cultists of the Dead Three plot
  endlessly to secure the ascendancy of their deities at the expense of innocent folk. (The three
  gods are described in more detail in chapter 5.)
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Elturgard">Elturgard</h4>
<p>
  The realm of Elturgard encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and Berdusk. It also
  includes much of the surrounding land, including the Fields of the Dead. Once a shining kingdom,
  Elturgard fell into disarray when its capital Elturel was dragged into the Nine Hells and back
  again. Even after the capital’s return, Elturgard struggles to pick up the pieces. Some of
  Elturgard’s outer cities have attempted to secede from the increasingly theocratic realm. Elturel
  keeps them close by threatening to withdraw the protection of the Hellriders, a cavalry force that
  keeps Elturgard’s loyal cities safe from danger.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Fall of Elturel and Its Aftermath.</em></strong> A radiant sphere called the
  Companion appeared over Elturel in 1444 DR, blazing like a second sun. Elturel’s people praised
  the god Torm for this fortuitous blessing, and Elturel expanded to become the holy nation of
  Elturgard. In truth, the Companion was summoned up by the archdevil Zariel to enact a decades-long
  grudge against the city. In 1492, it became a crackling orb of darkness, dragging Elturel and its
  inhabitants into Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells.
</p>
<p>
  While all reasonable folk know and fear the Nine Hells, this fear is largely abstract. Very few
  have ever had to see such a place with their own eyes or feel its heat on their skin. But that’s
  precisely what the citizens of Elturel had to do, as their friends and family were slain by
  marauding devils. After brave heroes eliminated the Companion and returned Elturel to the Material
  Plane, Elturgard’s theocratic government doubled down on the mandatory worship of Torm, Tyr, and
  Ilmater—three benevolent gods collectively called the Triad.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Elturel.</em></strong> Elturel’s people have become more pious after returning from
  the Nine Hells, desperate to ensure their afterlives send them to the Upper Planes. But this has
  created new problems, as the paranoid populace now distrusts and harasses tieflings, blaming them
  for the city’s fall. Fearing for their safety, Elturel’s tieflings have fled in droves for
  <a href="#BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</a>.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Najara">Najara</h4>
<p>
  The ancient realm of Najara stretches across the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of Chelimber, and the
  Forest of Wyrms. It is a land of yuan-ti, nagas, and lizardfolk. Najaran society is unfeeling and
  ever-calculating. The <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a> remained oblivious to Najara for over
  a millennia until Najara’s current ruler, the spirit naga Jarant, decided to make the realm’s
  presence known to its neighbors. For now, Najara’s nefarious motives remain unexplored. The Lords’
  Alliance and <a href="#Elturgard">Elturgard</a> alike have been too busy with other threats to
  investigate the serpent realm. Najara grows in power right under their noses, like a coiled snake
  waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ss’thar’tiss’ssun.</em></strong> Ancient and evil, the spirit naga Jarant rules the
  realm of Najara from its capital city Ss’thar’tiss’ssun with the aid of a silver circlet called
  the <em>Marlspire of Najara.</em> This artifact grants Jarant powerful abjuration magic and
  control over reptilian creatures—including the first ruler of the kingdom, Terpenzi, now a
  powerful bone naga called the Guardian of Najara.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Waterdeep">Waterdeep</h4>
<p>
  Also known as the City of Splendors, the bustling city of Waterdeep is ruled by a lordly council.
  The current Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, keeps her identity known to the public. The Masked Lords
  rule alongside her anonymously, thus preventing any of them from being bribed or threatened.
  Waterdeep boasts a prodigious magical academy at Blackstaff Tower, which is run by a wizard
  holding the office of the Blackstaff—currently Vajra Safahr.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>City Wards.</em></strong> Waterdeep is divided into several wards. Wards aren’t
  separated by walls or gates, and crossing between wards is easy. City wards include the Sea Ward,
  marked by the palatial fortress-estates of the city’s rich and powerful; the peacefully elegant
  North Ward; and the busy marketplaces of the Trade Ward. The Southern Ward is home to many
  immigrants, while the city’s poorest live and work in the Dock Ward. Waterdeep’s dead are entombed
  in the City of the Dead, a massive park and open air mausoleum within the city. Outside Waterdeep,
  a large collection of shelters that were once temporary housing for refugees has become a
  neighborhood of its own: the Field Ward. The Field Ward isn’t patrolled by the city guards and has
  no sanitation or other city services; it is home to Waterdeep’s most desperate citizens.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Defenses.</em></strong> While Waterdeep has a militia and city guard, its most famous
  defenders are magical walking statues and the griffon cavalry. The walking statues are eight
  enormous statues that sit dormant among the city’s buildings. The Blackstaff can activate them to
  defend the city in times of dire need, animating each statue into an unstoppable stone colossus.
  The griffon cavalry is made up of well-trained riders and their griffon mounts. Each rider wears a
  [magicitems]Ring of Feather Falling[/magicitems], allowing them to safely leap from their mounts
  in daring assaults on any enemy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Undermountain.</em></strong> The twenty-three-floor megadungeon of Undermountain
  stretches deep beneath the city of Waterdeep. Adventurers descend into it from a well in the
  Yawning Portal tavern to search for treasure. At the dungeon’s bottommost level lairs Halaster
  Blackcloak. Halaster’s motives are unknown and perhaps unknowable. He built this behemoth of a
  dungeon complex long before Waterdeep was founded, and he’s been stocking it with perils ever
  since. Many creatures have also found their way into Undermountain of their own accord, creating
  civilizations in its halls, including the bustling, crime-ridden city of Skullport.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Xanathar Guild.</em></strong> The Xanathar Guild is a criminal organization operating
  out of Skullport, a subterranean city beneath Waterdeep. Its gang activity frequently spills up
  into Waterdeep proper. Very few people know who or what Xanathar actually is: a paranoid,
  megalomaniacal beholder who fawns over his pet goldfish, Sylgar. Xanathar has eyes all over the
  bustling city of Waterdeep and despises his rival, the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#Zhentarim">Zhentarim</a>. For more on the
  Xanathar Guild, see chapter 6.

<p>
  Though <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> and <a href="#BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</a> have great
  influence in this region, their official territories don’t extend far beyond their city walls.
  Most of the land in this region doesn’t fall under any realm’s jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ardeep Forest.</em></strong> Once the heart of an elf kingdom, Ardeep Forest has
  shrunk over the years, its trees cut and sent to <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> to build ships
  and homes. About a decade ago, elves from <a href="#Evermeet">Evermeet</a> returned to the forest
  to defend it against further intrusion and exploitation. They aggressively drive out all who enter
  the forest. But Ardeep Forest remains a draw for adventurers of all stripes, as it houses many
  interesting ruins and magical sites.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Candlekeep.</em></strong> Candlekeep holds the largest repository of written lore in
  Faerûn. It is a towering, walled library standing proudly atop a seaside cliff. In order to enter
  Candlekeep, an individual must submit a work of writing not yet found within its halls. Its
  librarian-priests, the Avowed, retrieve tomes from the library for visitors. Candlekeep’s defenses
  include a mythal and a ghostly dragon called Miirym, the Sentinel Wyrm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dragonspear Castle.</em></strong> An infernal portal hides in the catacombs beneath
  the dwarven ruins known as Dragonspear Castle, on the edge of High Moor. It connects to Avernus,
  first layer of the Nine Hells, but is currently sealed shut. These days, a thick cloud of mist
  shrouds Dragonspear Castle from harsh sunlight. A mysterious group of vampires known as the
  Szarlnaxi coven lurks within.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Evereska.</em></strong> The elven city of Evereska is often called “a pocket of
  <a href="#Evermeet">Evermeet</a>,” and it shares that fabled land’s elusive mystique. Evereska is
  rumored to exist in a great valley in the mountains near <a href="#Anauroch">Anauroch</a>,
  protected by a mythal and defended by elf warriors who ride giant eagles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fields of the Dead.</em></strong> Myriad wars and skirmishes have taken place on the
  Fields of the Dead over the centuries. It is a vast, rolling plain of windswept grasses. On rare
  occasions, it belches forth hostile undead, the buried remnants of wars long forgotten.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Graypeak Mountains.</em></strong> Stone giants and stone goliaths call the Graypeak
  Mountains home. The range is riddled with abandoned mines of both dwarven and Netherese origin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>High Moor.</em></strong> Trolls and cruel goblinoids prowl the rocky wilderness of the
  High Moor, as do nomadic orcs and human berserkers. An evil dracolich called the Old One lairs in
  Orogoth, a ruined villa on the moor, still guarding the ancient wealth of a long-lost Netherese
  noble family.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Orlumbor.</em></strong> There’s no better place to purchase or repair a ship in the
  <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a> than Orlumbor. This rocky, cavernous island hides a great
  harbor full of skilled shipwrights and dockworkers who make some of sturdiest vessels around at a
  record pace. At the moment, Orlumbor has an exclusive business relationship with
  <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Trielta Hills.</em></strong> Halflings live out idyllic, pastoral lives in the quaint
  Trielta Hills. Its humble people have little in the way of valuables to covet, which has allowed
  Trieltans to exist undisturbed by Najara to the north. Short-lived gold rushes bring outsiders to
  Trielta every now and then.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Trollclaws.</em></strong> The rough Trollclaw Hills teem with ravenous trolls.
  Caravans journeying south to Baldur’s Gate or north out of the Fields of Dead cross the river at
  the Trollclaw Ford and hire adventurers to battle off the regenerating monsters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Warlock’s Crypt.</em></strong> A Netherese enclave crashed to the ground in the Troll
  Hills over a thousand years ago, becoming a set of ruins now called Warlock’s Crypt. Hundreds of
  undead dwell among the site’s shattered rubble and twisted towers. Liches, including the great
  lich Larloch, perform bizarre experiments on the creatures of the surrounding region and release
  them back into the wild as terrifying horrors.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Wood of Sharp Teeth.</em></strong> Hundreds of years ago, these woods were the site of
  a werewolf city called Vehlarr. Rumor has it that wicked lycanthropes are congregating in these
  woods once again to recreate that society.

    the Moonshaes, and the dragon Hoondarrh hungers for power.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>
  There’s a reason most sea routes in Faerûn stick close to the coast: navigating the cold, choppy
  waters of the Trackless Sea is no easy feat. If the waves themselves weren’t threats enough, the
  creatures that prowl them certainly are. Vicious pirates from the Nelanther isles delight in
  pillaging ships and slaughtering their crews. Devotees of Umberlee summon tsunamis and whirlpools
  to drag folk to the ocean floor as offerings to their god. Bloodthirsty sahuagin and merrow
  surface from the depths to rip and tear at prey, and the enigmatic kingdoms of the storm giants
  lie deeper still.
</p>
<p>
  Low-level adventures in the Trackless Sea might focus on the happenings of a single isle. Once
  characters begin to outgrow that island, their adventures might require sailing to neighboring
  locales and discovering the distinct cultures therein. Seasoned heroes might explore what lurks on
  the seafloor or voyage west to discover what lies beyond the map.
</p>
<p>
  Several thriving and unique island realms call the Trackless Sea home, but cultural exchange among
  these realms is inhibited by the ocean’s dangers. The folk dwelling under the shadow of the cruel
  dragon Hoondarrh in <a href="#Mintarn">Mintarn</a> lead very different lives than their neighbors
  in the magical Moonshaes. <a href="#Lantan">Lantan</a>’s denizens enjoy the conveniences conferred
  by their many inventions but are cautious and slow to share their discoveries with the outside
  world.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Lantan">Lantan</h4>
<p>
  Folk on the mainland know little of the reclusive realm of Lantan apart from its people’s devotion
  to Gond, the god of invention. Complex locks, oil lamps, tripwires, and light-beam intruder alarms
  have origins on the island. If a trap in a Faerûnian dungeon has a complex mechanism involved,
  odds are the technology originated in Lantan. The archipelago is governed by a theocratic
  twelve-person council called the Ayrorch, high-ranking members of the Church of Gond. Gnomes make
  up much of the island’s population and most of the council.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Lantanese Inventions.</em></strong> The last hundred years have seen the secluded
  island realm of Lantan grow even more secretive. Its recent innovations include packets of
  explosive smokepowder, parachutes, firearms, and even submarines. Lantan’s people worry that the
  rest of Faerûn might learn how to replicate these inventions, potentially diminishing the island
  realm’s trading power. Lantan exports inventions in small shipments to mainland port cities like
  <a href="#BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</a> and <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a> in exchange for
  precious metals and critical resources that are hard to find on Lantan’s islands.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Northern Lantan.</em></strong> The large northern island of Lantan is home to the
  capital city of Sambar, which houses the realm’s ruling council. The city of Illul lies not far
  away, housing the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration. Led by a high artificer, this wondrous
  temple is the center of Gond worship in Faerûn.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Orlil.</em></strong> The seemingly barren isle of Orlil boasts a self-contained
  network of Underdark tunnels that house thriving communes of Lantanese deep gnomes, or
  svirfneblin. Unlike the svirfneblin of Faerûn’s mainland, Orlil’s deep gnomes have never known
  drow subjugation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Southern Lantan.</em></strong> Outsiders who wish to trade and parley with Lantan must
  do so on Lantan’s southern island, at a port city called Anchoril. Southern Lantan’s people are
  just as industrious and inventive as those to the north, but the citizens of Anchoril feign a
  lesser degree of technological advancement to keep Lantan’s secrets safe.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Mintarn">Mintarn</h4>
<p>
  The island of Mintarn, between the <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a> Isles and
  <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a>, is best known for its mercenaries. Mintarn is known as neutral
  ground, where enemies meet to negotiate and bargain with each other. Fledgling heroes often travel
  to Mintarn to make names for themselves. The island’s taverns bustle with quest-givers and
  quest-seekers from across the <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a> and the mainland alike.
  Mintarn has always been governed by a single ruler self-styled as a tyrant—though these tyrants
  generally rule with a light hand. But even the current tyrant trembles before the ancient red
  dragon Hoondarrh, who lairs on a small volcanic island northwest of Mintarn and demands annual
  tribute from Mintarn’s people.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hoondarrh.</em></strong> Up until recently, Mintarn enjoyed unprecedented prosperity
  by offering its mercenary services to the wealthy cities of Neverwinter and
  <a href="#Waterdeep">Waterdeep</a>. As Mintarn’s wealth grew, the ancient red dragon Hoondarrh
  demanded increasingly exorbitant tributes from the island’s inhabitants. Today, Hoondarrh’s
  influence keeps Neverwinter and Waterdeep from doing any business with Mintarn. This has left the
  island’s ruler—Her Tyrancy Bloeth Embuirhan—with few ways to pay an increasingly greedy red
  dragon. Mintarn is poised to undergo a violent change of rulership as its people clamor for a new
  approach in dealing with Hoondarrh.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MoonshaeIsles">Moonshae Isles</h4>
<p>
  Fey abound and giants lurk in the misty Moonshae Isles, an archipelago steeped in fey magic. These
  wondrous isles are home to two cultures: the rugged, seafaring Norlanders and the practical,
  hard-working Ffolk. These cultures once warred with each other but have come together under the
  ruling Kendrick dynasty. Ffolk worship the Earthmother, a divine embodiment of the Moonshae Isles.
  Springs of natural magic called moonwells are her windows into the world. Druids and rangers tend
  the moonwells and protect them from a new, insidious curse called the Rusting. This curse
  threatens to transform moonwells into pools of stinking oil and living things into rusted iron.
  See chapter 5 of
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/dnd/fraif">Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</a> for
  more on the Moonshae Isles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Rusting and the Rusted.</em></strong> A century ago, <a href="#Amn">Amn</a> invaded
  the Moonshae isle of Snowdown. Led by the vampire Erliza Darissa, Amn’s soldiers stripped the
  island’s mines bare, chopped down its forests, and polluted its ponds. Moonshavians banded
  together to slay Erliza and drive out the Amnians, but the vampire laid a curse on the Moonshaes
  with her dying words. This curse became the Rusting. Animals and plants affected by the Rusting
  warp into twisted iron before eventually crumbling to dust. Moonwells become pits of slick, black
  oil. People who dwell in an area gripped by the Rusting for too long become Rusted constructs who
  abhor the living. Some Rusted Norlanders even terrorize the Moonshae’s coasts in giant warships
  plated with rusted iron.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Alaron.</em></strong> The Moonshavian island of Alaron is home to a large Ffolk
  population. Caer Calidyrr—a fortress that overlooks the city of Calidyrr—houses Derid Kendrick,
  high king of the Moonshaes. Norlanders live in the northern half of the island, herding sheep and
  working mines in the Farheight range.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gwynneth.</em></strong> Gwynneth is the most magical of the Moonshae Isles and the
  center of the Earthmother’s power. As of yet, it is the only Moonshae Isle totally untouched by
  the Rusting. Its landmarks include the rebuilt castle of Caer Corwell and Myrloch Vale, a forested
  valley teeming with fey. In the north of the island, the fey kingdom of Sarifal endures, ruled by
  High Lady Ordalf.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Moray.</em></strong> The Moonshavian isle of Moray is home to monsters and the Red
  Shadow: packs of werewolves who worship a violent beast-god called Kazgaroth. The Red Shadow
  regularly abducts innocents for sacrifice in violent rituals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Norland.</em></strong> When Norlanders first sailed to the Moonshaes, they landed on
  the cold island now known as Norland. It remains the seat of Norlander culture in the Moonshaes.
  Jarl Olfsvenn is loyal to High King Kendrick, but he’s torn by the fact his sister has fallen
  victim to the Rusting curse and taken on a new identity as Queen Forfallen. Overfishing in the Sea
  of Moonshae has brought the Rusting to Rogarsheim, and dockworkers show the signs of exposure to
  the curse: rust-colored marks around the eyes and a hacking cough.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Oman’s Isle.</em></strong> Giants and their goliath kin live in well-established
  steadings and ancient Ostorian ruins all over Oman’s Isle. Visitors can safely land at Trondheim,
  which is overseen by goliaths working for the giants.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Snowdown.</em></strong> The island of Snowdown is a blight on the Moonshaes. The
  Rusting first manifested at its only moonwell, located near the center of the island. Attempts to
  rein in environmental destruction caused by Amn have proved futile, and the island’s population
  shrinks each year.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="OtherIslandsandOceanSites">Other Islands and Ocean Sites</h4>
<p>
  Beyond the major islands and archipelagos, unaffiliated islands dot the sea—and some mysterious
  sites lie hidden under the waves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gundarlun.</em></strong> Gundarlun, west of Neverwinter, experiences wintry weather
  most of the year, and its Northlander population is regularly terrorized by Arveiaturace, a white
  dragon from the North. Off the island’s southwest coast lies the wreck of the
  <em>Golden Crown</em>, a Calishite merchant vessel that was carrying a vast cargo of gold, silver,
  electrum, and gemstones when it sank in a storm. A wizard named Hoch Miraz also went down with the
  ship. Its treasure has never been recovered.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Maelstrom.</em></strong> The storm giant stronghold of Maelstrom sits on the seafloor
  somewhere between Ruathym, the Whalebones, and the Moonshaes. Serissa, the titular queen of all
  giantkind, resides here. A natural whirlpool occasionally manifests far above the palace, wrecking
  ships and dragging them down to the seafloor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mother-of-Mists.</em></strong> Adventurers from <a href="#Chult">Chult</a> and
  <a href="#Lantan">Lantan</a> alike have journeyed to Mother-of-Mists in search of treasure,
  finding nothing but danger. Poisonous vapors and smoke mix with cold sea winds to create the
  ever-present mists for which this volcanic island is known.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Nelanther.</em></strong> Riddled with communities of monstrous pirates, the
  Nelanther islands have few resources and are plagued with infighting. Ancient towers guarded by
  monsters and magic wards jut from several of the isles and even from the sea itself. The
  Nelanther’s pirates avoid these towers out of a mix of fear and superstition.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Northlander Isles.</em></strong> Norlander culture originated long ago on the bleak,
  mountainous island of Ruathym in the Northlander Isles, north of the
  <a href="#Moonsea">Moonsea</a> Isles. Most Norlanders left these isles long ago in favor of more
  hospitable climates, but a few scattered steadings remain. Queen Forfallen, a Rusted pirate queen
  and Norlander, uses Ruathym as a safe port.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Purple Rocks.</em></strong> Few have visited the distant Purple Rocks archipelago, far
  to the west of Neverwinter and so named because it appears dark purple under stormy skies. Those
  who return report its friendly inhabitants sport odd piscine features and also note an odd lack of
  children and elders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Sea of Swords.</em></strong> The Sea of Swords is a cold and storm-wracked gulf. Most
  of the <a href="#SwordCoast">Sword Coast</a>’s trade routes hug close to the shore.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tuern.</em></strong> Red dragons and fire giants war constantly on the volcanic island
  of Tuern, far to the north and west. For decades, they demanded tribute from Tuern’s Humanoid
  population. When the people finally refused, the dragons and giants began conscripting them as
  disposable infantry in their brutal wars. People in <a href="#Mintarn">Mintarn</a> who have heard
  of Tuern see it as a cautionary tale.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Whalebones.</em></strong> Whales come to die for reasons unknown at a set of islands
  called the Whalebones. The shores are littered with their bleached-white bones. Rocs perch on the
  mountaintops while petty self-proclaimed “kings” of the tiny islets squabble among each other for
  power.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheTracklessSea">Life in the Trackless Sea</h4>
<p>
  No matter what island they dock on, outsiders quickly discover that life in the
  <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a> can be quite different than life on the mainland.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Denizens of the Deep.</em></strong> Entire realms lie hidden beneath Faerûn’s waves.
  Storm giants live in great palaces on the seafloor. Merfolk live in sunlit shallows, while
  monstrous merrow and sahuagin lair in dark grottoes but surface to feast on innocents. Sea elves
  are much rarer in the Trackless Sea than they are in the inland Sea of Fallen Stars, as they’re
  hunted relentlessly in these waters by sahuagin and their malenti spies—a breed of sahuagin with
  the appearance of sea elves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Piracy.</em></strong> Pirates abound in the Trackless Sea. Norlander culture has a
  long history of piracy and raiding, sometimes harrying the mainland’s merchant vessels along the
  Sea of Swords. Mercenaries from <a href="#Mintarn">Mintarn</a> sell their services to privateering
  crews. But the most fearsome pirates hail from the monstrous Nelanther Isles. These ogre,
  lizardfolk, and minotaur buccaneers aren’t bound by codes of honor; they torture their victims and

<p>
  <strong><em>Ships.</em></strong> The lightly built galleys favored in more sheltered waters don’t
  fare well in the winds and storms of the <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a>. Savvy
  seafarers opt for bigger, more durable sailing ships instead. The Norlanders of Ruathym and the
  Moonshaes build swift yet sturdy longships, equipped with smaller, specialized boats called
  whaleboats for whaling. They are among the most recognizable ships on the seas, but a trained eye
  can recognize any vessel’s land of origin by its size, shape, and build, even if the ship isn’t
  flying any flags.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Umberlee Worship.</em></strong> Inhabitants of the
  <a href="#TracklessSea">Trackless Sea</a> are ever-wary of Umberlee, the Wavemother. Cultists
  strike fear into the hearts of sailors, warning of Umberlee’s ire and demanding passage on ships.
  Each coastal city maintains shrines to the cruel sea god, and sailors leave flowers or small
  candies in hopes Umberlee will show mercy on a ship’s next voyage. Savvy pirate crews have been
  known to recruit priests of Umberlee to trap unsuspecting merchant ships in whirlpools or
  devastate towns with tsunamis before a pillage.

<p>
  The subtropical Vilhon Reach lies southwest of the Sea of Fallen Stars, situated along its
  eponymous gulf. [skill]Nature[/skill] is more respected here than in other areas of Faerûn, a
  result of both the Emerald Enclave’s enormous influence on the region and the region’s history of
  natural disasters.
</p>
<p>
  People wary of magic often settle in the Vilhon, since some of its cities have laws that curtail
  or even ban spellcasting. Some Thayan commoners desperate to escape the rule of
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#RedWizards">Red Wizards</a> speak in
  whispers of Ilighôn, an island in the Vilhon Reach where no divination magic can find them.
</p>
<p>
  Adventures in this region might explore philosophical themes about the role of magic in society or
  people’s struggle to coexist with nature. They might be wizards on the run, druids and rangers in
  search of training, or mercenaries hired to capture fugitive spellcasters. The realm of
  <a href="#Chondath">Chondath</a> also provides the opportunity for heroes to help small towns and
  villages extricate themselves from the grasp of a greedy nation, whether by diplomacy or force.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Chondath">Chondath</h4>
<p>
  Chondath was once a large and powerful realm comprising all of the southern
  <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a>, with distant colonies in the land now known as
  <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a>. Military defeats and numerous plagues led Chondath to shrink in on
  itself over a millennium. Then the Spellplague decimated nearly all of Chondath’s coastal
  settlements, sealing the dying realm’s fate.
</p>
<p>
  Today, Chondath is but a shell of its former glory. Its capital city Arrabar still stands,
  desperately demanding increasingly exorbitant taxes from the tiny towns of Samra, Timindar, and
  Orbech—all three of which are considering secession. Adventurers flock to Chondath to see what
  abandoned treasures lie amid the ruined cities of Mussum, Iljak, Shamph, and Hlath.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Arrabar.</em></strong> Arrabar, capital of Chondath, is a city determined to hold on
  to the last vestiges of its realm’s old splendor. Lady Udriana Wianar rules Arrabar and the realm
  from a grand palace called the Generon. Her family, along with Arrabar’s many nobles, lead
  decadent lifestyles funded by the rest of Chondath.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Chondalwood.</em></strong> Rumor has it that a city-state of reclusive wood elves
  called Rucien-Xan lies hidden somewhere in the Chondalwood forest. Those who’ve searched the woods
  have found only monsters, raucous satyrs, territorial druids, and Ghostwise halflings—a
  distrustful and uncharacteristically ferocious clan of halflings with telepathic gifts.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Sespech">Sespech</h4>
<p>
  Once a barony of <a href="#Chondath">Chondath</a>, Sespech gained its independence centuries ago
  after a civil war called the Rotting War. It has defended itself fiercely ever since. With its
  neighbor Chondath in decline, Sespech now has little use for its military. Many of Sespech’s
  former soldiers have turned to lives of adventure, roaming the
  <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a> and beyond. They’re often surprised and disturbed by the
  magic they find, for magic is more deeply suspect in Sespech than anywhere else in the Vilhon. In
  Sespech, the use of magic to charm or injure another person is a crime punishable by death.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mimph.</em></strong> A prosperous Sespech trade city, Mimph relies almost entirely on
  its port—famously, no roads lead to Mimph. A strong navy is based here. Rivalry with nearby
  Arrabar is so intense that merchants prefer to do business with only one city or the other, so as
  to avoid inciting violence. Helm is Mimph’s patron deity; Helm’s large temple is protected by a
  chapter of the Order of the Gauntlet (described in chapter 6).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nagawater.</em></strong> A bobbing line of buoys lit by [spells]Continual
  Flame[/spells] spells divides the freshwater lake of Nagawater. The northern half belongs to the
  realm of Sespech, and fishers from Ormpetarr fish there often. The southern half is inhabited by a
  peaceful guardian naga. Those who assume the naga is guarding some treasure and attempt to
  retrieve it generally end up drowned in the lake’s still waters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ormpetarr.</em></strong> Ormpetarr, capital city of Sespech, rests along the
  Nagawater. Baron Yoric Maplefoot rules Sespech from a modest manor here. He is a curt halfling man
  of few words, well-respected by his people for his daily public court sessions in which he rules
  on issues brought to him by citizens.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Winterwood.</em></strong> Dim light filters through the dense canopy of the
  Winterwood’s tall oaks and pines. A cool mist coats the ground like snow, giving the forest its
  name. Several orc communities call the Winterwood home; they defend their villages against hordes
  of berserk plant monsters.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Turmish">Turmish</h4>
<p>
  The mercantile realm of Turmish, often called the heartland of the
  <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a>, is expertly managed and mostly peaceful. Most Turmishan
  folk are humans, but the realm is also home to many dwarves whose families emigrated from the
  nearby mountains, as well as other more recent immigrants. Turmishan merchants have a reputation
  as honest and fair traders.
</p>
<p>
  This democratic republic’s tall mountain ranges shield it from outside aggression. Turmish also
  intentionally stays out of its neighbors’ conflicts, refusing to provide aid of any kind. It’s a
  stance that has often drawn the temporary ire of nearby realms, but it’s served Turmish well in
  the long term.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Alaghôn.</em></strong> A great fire blazed through Turmish’s capital city Alaghôn a
  millennium ago, and Alaghôn’s buildings have been constructed of stone ever since. Turmish
  children play hide-and-seek in this stone city’s hundreds of cubbyholes and hiding places,
  sometimes discovering secret passages to long-forgotten dungeon complexes.
</p>
<p>
  The citizens of Alaghôn hold free elections to appoint the Assembly of Stars, Turmish’s ruling
  council. These elected officials then select one of their rank to be Lord of Turmish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Aphrun Mountains.</em></strong> A handful of cloistered stone and fire goliath
  families live in the otherwise unsettled Aphrun Mountains, retreating to hidden caverns whenever
  Mount Kolimnis spouts ash or red dragons circle overhead.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Five Lions.</em></strong> An infamous and remote inn, the Five Lions was the site
  of a massacre—nobles fleeing revolution in far-off <a href="#Tethyr">Tethyr</a> took refuge here,
  but rebels caught up with them and all were killed. Now the inn is a haven for mages hiding from
  legal persecution. They have perpetuated a rumor that the inn is haunted by the restless spirits
  of Tethyrian dead, and this provides cover for their activities, including magical instruction and
  experimentation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gildenglade.</em></strong> Gildenglade was once a thriving Turmish city populated by
  elves and dwarves. Then Mount Kolimnis erupted in 1423 DR, burying Gildenglade in volcanic mud and
  ash. Years later, after the lava had cooled, caves opened into the buried city. Dungeon delvers
  who explore these ruins find them eerily preserved—and teeming with monsters from the Underdark.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Gulthmere.</em></strong> Nobanion, a benevolent god worshiped as a divine protector of
  the region, is said to live in the Gulthmere forest. Folk say they’ve seen the regal lion-god
  prowl through the foliage or even leap to their defense. Some faithful worshipers of Nobanion
  pilgrimage from the <a href="#ShiningPlains">Shining Plains</a> to Gulthmere in hope of catching a
  glimpse of Nobanion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mount Andrus.</em></strong> A semi-active volcano, Mount Andrus famously destroyed the
  home of the Candlekairn orc clan a thousand years ago. The volcano is sacred to Talos, whose
  worshipers maintain a temple and shrines in the mountain’s heart, where they ally with evil
  elementals and other monsters capable of surviving the blistering heat. But Mount Andrus also
  hides a <em>Time Gate</em>, a portal that sends all who use it backward in time. The gate is
  protected by Mystra, who forbids anyone except her handpicked champions from using it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Orsraun Mountains.</em></strong> Kobolds and red dragons lurk in the uncharted Orsraun
  Mountains, and the dwarven city-kingdom of Ironfang Deep lies beneath the ranges’ northwest
  mountains. Some dwarves have migrated from Ironfang to Turmish, but many Ironfang dwarves loathe
  that upper realm. Centuries ago, a warlord led Turmish into battle against Ironfang, and
  Ironfang’s dwarves are slow to forget the lives lost.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Starfall Stream Pool.</em></strong> A popular vacation destination, this picturesque
  town in the foothills of the Orsraun Mountains is particularly famous as a place to celebrate the
  Festival of the Moon. But the cult of Malar preys on tourists during this time, and the town
  desperately hires mercenaries and adventurers to keep visitors safe.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Xorhun.</em></strong> Xorhun’s population consists mostly of elves and gnomes. This
  Turmish city is built in the fashion of the great elven cities of old, with elegant towers and
  abundant trees. Twin and triplet births are unusually common here; the elves and gnomes consider
  this a blessing from their gods.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ShiningPlains">Shining Plains</h4>
<p>
  Shimmering heat waves rise from the vast, dry grassland of the Shining Plains most of the year,
  giving rise to its name. Centaurs and thri-kreen call these plains home. They maintain civil, if
  distant, relationships with the handful of towns within the plains. No unifying force controls the
  Shining Plains and the nearby hills, mountains, and swampy forest, but influences from across the
  <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a> extend here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Deepwing Mountains.</em></strong> The Deepwing Mountains are named for the many winged
  monsters that call its heights home: manticores, griffons, hippogriffs, dragons, wyverns, and
  more.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Nathlekh.</em></strong> Cats abound in the independent city-state of Nathlekh, resting
  on rooftops and sipping milk from public troughs. Nearly everyone in this so-called City of Cats
  worships Nobanion, the lion-god rumored to roam in the nearby Gulthmere forest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Wetwoods.</em></strong> Lizardfolk, bullywugs, and other bog-dwelling creatures call
  the misty Wetwoods home. Apart from some tiny halfling hamlets, the most notable settlement here
  is Urml, a village of reclusive bullywugs.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="IndependentCityStates">Independent City-States</h4>
<p>
  The <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a> is dotted with independent city-states. There was once
  a time when these city-states feared reannexation into the Chondathan empire, but that time has
  long since passed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hlondeth.</em></strong> <a href="#Turmish">Turmish</a> carefully maintains a friendly
  relationship with this City of Serpents, which controls the only trade road out of Turmish. House
  Extaminos, a line of guileful yuan-ti, has ruled Hlondeth for centuries. Snakelike architecture
  and green marble buildings decorate its streets.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ilighôn.</em></strong> The
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#EmeraldEnclave">Emerald Enclave</a>’s
  leaders, an Elder Circle of druids, reside in the faction’s headquarters on the verdant island of
  Ilighôn. Arcane magic doesn’t function on the island; magic from primal or divine sources is
  unaffected. As such, Ilighôn’s port city Sapra has become a haven for those seeking refuge from
  mages. The island is protected by the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus, colossal elementals that deter
  visitors and answer to the Emerald Enclave.
</p>
<p>
  Locals of the <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a> call the islands of Wavecrest and Ilighôn
  the Eyes of Silvanus. Unlike its peaceful sister island, Wavecrest is an uninhabited and dangerous
  jungle teeming with ferocious beasts and monsters.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ixinos.</em></strong> Very little is known about Ixinos, a small forested island at
  the entrance to the Vilhon Reach, as the people there repel all visitors and refuse to engage in
  diplomacy even with their neighbors on the Emerald Enclave isle of Ilighôn. The only known
  settlement is the port town Tazixor, where the mysterious queen of Ixinos keeps court. The isle is
  defended by a mercenary company called the She-Wolves, and most of what is known about Ixinos
  comes from these mercenaries, who travel the Reach in small groups selling their services.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Reth the Half-Ruin.</em></strong> Half of the independent city of Reth crumbled into
  the sea during the catastrophic events of the Spellplague. Some adventurers take the plunge,
  battling kuo-toa in those underwater ruins to find the lost treasures therein.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LifeintheVilhonReach">Life in the Vilhon Reach</h4>
<p>
  In the wake of the Second Sundering, the <a href="#VilhonReach">Vilhon Reach</a> has enjoyed a
  period of relative calm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Emerald Enclave’s Influence.</em></strong> The
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dnd/frhof/factions-of-the-realms#EmeraldEnclave">Emerald Enclave</a>
  (described in chapter 6) was founded on the island of Ilighôn in the 4th century DR by a coalition
  of priests from Turmish and Chondath who were devoted to nature deities. Its influence remains
  greater in the Vilhon Reach than anywhere else in Faerûn. Thanks to this faction, folk across the
  Reach share an immense respect for nature. The few callous folk throughout history who have
  polluted the waters of the Reach or tried logging in protected forests have been met with the
  Emerald Enclave’s unbridled wrath.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>The Rotting War and Distrust of Magic.</em></strong> The Vilhon Reach’s subtropical
  climate has, unfortunately, made it a perfect incubator for plagues throughout the region’s
  history. None haunt its people’s collective consciousness more than the magical contagion that
  ended the Rotting War. This Chondathan civil war began in 900 DR and gained its name when
  archmages from Arrabar and Hlath unleashed a necromantic plague. The rotting contagion decimated
  all sides of the conflict and spread beyond anyone’s expectations. This plague has long since
  subsided, but <a href="#Chondath">Chondath</a>, <a href="#Sespech">Sespech</a>, and the
  independent city-states near them remain distrustful of magic as a result.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spellmarks.</em></strong> A few villages and hamlets in the southern Vilhon Reach ask
  spellcasters to identify themselves by drawing a distinctive rune on their forehead with ink or
  chalk. This “spellmark” tradition derives from an old practice in the Vilhon wherein people would
  paint several circles on their forehead to indicate they could read or write—a tradition that
  became defunct as literacy rates rose.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Volcanic Activity.</em></strong> The volcanoes around Turmish are both a blessing and
  a curse: their ash creates the fertile soil for which Turmish is well known, but it has also laid
  waste to more than one Turmishan settlement. Mount Ugruth is long dormant, while Mount Kolimnis
  and Mount Andrus are still active. Turmishan spellcasters do their best to predict eruptions and
  keep their cities safe. Troublesome red dragons flock to the volcanoes’ smoky heights to make
  their lairs.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Beyond">Beyond</h3>
<p>
  Toril is a vast world with continents so far unexplored. And beyond Toril lie the worlds of
  Realmspace, visited by spelljammers and other travelers of the Astral Sea. Some locations that lie
  beyond the map are detailed below, but you can create additional realms as you like, making the
  Forgotten Realms even more your own.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Chult">Chult</h4>
<p>
  Chult is a land of tropical wilderness: dense jungles and snaky rivers ringed by mountains,
  volcanoes, and sheer escarpments. Walls of mountains to the west, south, and east shield the
  interior from the sea and from the view of sailors. The rivers are so sluggish that it can be
  difficult determining which direction is upstream and which is down. The rivers pick up speed only
  where they thunder down through steep-sided gorges.
</p>
<p>
  Chult has long been inhabited by bullywugs, dwarves, humans, goblins, and lizardfolk, as well as
  dinosaurs, hydras, wyverns, and other monsters. The people of Chult revere a deity named Ubtao,
  whose divine rival, Dendar the Night Serpent, is said to be imprisoned beneath volcanoes called
  the Peaks of Flame.
</p>
<p>
  Chult’s coast from the Bay of Chult to Refuge Bay offers beaches from which explorers embark into
  the jungle, but the Bay of Chult is the only spot that welcome travelers from afar. The rest of
  the peninsula is a breeding ground for bloodsucking, disease-bearing insects; monstrous reptiles;
  carnivorous birds and beasts of every variety; and murderous undead.
</p>
<p>
  Two locations in Chult are described below; see
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/toa">Tomb of Annihilation</a> for much more detail.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mezro.</em></strong> The city of Mezro is widely thought to have been destroyed in the
  Spellplague. In fact, its inhabitants saved it through powerful magic, whisking it away into a
  demiplane and leaving only ruins behind. Some hints suggest the city will return when it is no
  longer in danger. The Flaming Fist, a mercenary company out of
  <a href="#BaldursGate">Baldur’s Gate</a>, has searched the ruins of Mezro extensively and still
  sends patrols there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Port Nyanzaru.</em></strong> Port Nyanzaru hugs the coastline at the south end of the
  Bay of Chult. It’s a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city—the only city in Chult that
  isn’t in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. The city is run by seven influential merchant
  princes. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the
  streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races’ outcomes. The city also
  boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Evermeet">Evermeet</h4>
<p>
  Almost twenty thousand years ago, elves used high magic to create a homeland for themselves. In
  the process, they devastated Toril in a cataclysmic disaster eventually known as the Sundering.
  But the island they created, Evermeet, remains. Elves from across Faerûn eventually travel to the
  island.
</p>
<p>
  Evermeet is protected by many layers of defenses. First, it is magically warded to prevent
  navigators from finding the island. Winds and subtle currents turn ships aside, stars move in the
  sky, and powerful illusions hide the island itself. Only navigators entrusted with secret
  knowledge can find the way.
</p>
<p>
  Second, a great navy shields Evermeet from enemies and allows the island nation to project its
  power into Faerûn when necessary. Elf merchants bring goods from Evermeet to markets in Faerûn and
  import anything the elves can’t make themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the capital city of Leuthilspar is protected by magically constructed walls of glass.
  Evermeet’s Royal Council meets here.
</p>
<p>
  Evermeet lies at a conjunction of three planes of existence: the Material Plane, the Feywild, and
  Arvandor. Non-elves aren’t permitted to visit, but on very rare occasions, exceptions have been
  made, and at least one gnome has managed to reach the island by stowing away with an elf traveler.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LakeofSteam">Lake of Steam</h4>
<p>
  With independent city-states on the north shore and a succession of small countries founded or
  conquered by people of many different agendas to the south, the Lake of Steam is a hodgepodge of
  varying interests, bustling trade, and frequently changing boundaries. Most of the cities on the
  north shore were part of <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a> in the past and retain Calimshan’s
  desire for wealth, comfort, and influence, as well as a strong desire to remain independent. The
  intrigues brewing around these cities led observers to dub the northern shore the Moonsea of the
  South.
</p>
<p>
  The Border Kingdoms on the southern shore are the homes of powerful adventurers of many types,
  each seeking to carve out a piece of land and rule it in the manner they prefer … at least until
  the next would-be ruler decides to take over. Wizard towers, monasteries, fortresses, and temples
  dot the Border Kingdoms, only to have their owners replaced time and again.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Ankhapur.</em></strong> The city of Ankhapur boasts a thriving industry centered on
  pearls retrieved from the stinking yellow water of the Lake of Steam. The magnificent pearls
  prized from oysters that grow to enormous size fetch high prices in the markets of
  <a href="#Calimshan">Calimshan</a> and <a href="#Amn">Amn</a>.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheShaar">The Shaar</h4>
<p>
  The Shaar is a vast, rolling grassland running from the Shining Sea to the distant lands of the
  east. Nomadic humans (the dozen or so tribes of the Shaaryan), centaurs, and gnolls populate the
  Shaar, hunting and herding various animals, and occasionally raiding each other. The land supports
  its native grasses splendidly but is ill suited for agriculture—it’s not a desert, but the land
  bakes by day and freezes by night.
</p>
<p>
  The dozen or so nomad tribes known collectively as the Shaaryan have never been unified, though
  they share a common culture and way of life. Shaaryan humans seldom stray in large numbers from
  their ancestral plains, largely because their horses don’t do well outside the Shaar.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Lhesper.</em></strong> This ruined city is home to a powerful clan of yuan-ti. Human
  travelers along the shores of Lake Lhespen often fall prey to bandits under yuan-ti domination and
  are carried back to a terrible fate in Lhesper—usually sacrifice to the yuan-ti’s evil god, but
  sometimes transformation into monstrous servitors to the serpent race. The Shaaryan give it a wide
  berth.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Shaarmid.</em></strong> A free trading city populated mostly by human folk who claim
  no kinship with the Shaaryan nomads, Shaarmid is accepted by the tribes as a longtime ally because
  the city’s people have a history of brokering excellent deals for the nomads with the traders from
  the rest of Faerûn. Merchants flock to Shaarmid for safety from Shaaryan bandits and other
  raiders.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Sossal">Sossal</h4>
<p>
  The remote realm of Sossal, far to the north of <a href="#Narfell">Narfell</a>, has little contact
  with the rest of Faerûn. Once or twice a year (generally in the summer), visitors from Sossal
  arrive in <a href="#Damara">Damara</a>, bringing furs, seal meat from the
  <a href="#GreatGlacier">Great Glacier</a>, beautiful items of shaped wood, and gold. They leave
  with dwarven weapons, silver, and various kinds of meat to trade with the people of the glacier.
  Some Sossrim wield druidic magic to bend plants to their will, pass through undergrowth
  impenetrable to others, or even transport themselves from one tree to another. In fact, the ornate
  and smoothly shaped Sossar furniture sold so steeply in <a href="#Sembia">Sembia</a> isn’t carved
  at all, but sculpted by the minds of Sossrim “carvers.”
</p>
