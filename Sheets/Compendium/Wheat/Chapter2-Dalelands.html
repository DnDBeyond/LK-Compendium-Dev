    The Dalelands are broad forest vales with rolling farmlands, linked by narrow trade roads
    running through beautiful woods. Blessed with fertile soil and a temperate climate (but harsh
    winters), the Dalelands are the breadbasket of the Heartlands. The independent spirit of
    Dalefolk balanced with their centuries of cooperation with the elves of
    <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a> have made the Dalelands the home of many of Faerûn’s
    greatest heroes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The oldest dales were founded over a thousand years ago by refugees from war-torn regions to the
    east and south. They found the immense, primeval forest of Cormanthor, home to an ancient elf
    civilization. Eltargrim, leader of the elves at the time, created the Dales Compact: an
    agreement that stated in return for promising not to cut deeper into the forest, the Dalefolk
    were allowed to settle around the forest’s edges or in places where the great trees didn’t grow.
    Spellcasters from both sides worked together to raise the Standing Stone in the center of
    Cormanthor as a symbol of unity. Elves opened the city of
    <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a> to the Dalefolk, and a golden age flourished for
    centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, Myth Drannor is abandoned, but the Dalefolk still keep the Dales Compact. Eleven dales
    exist today, each with its own territory, government (or lack of it), militia, trading pacts,
    ambitions, and character. But dales come and go, their fortunes waxing and waning in the face of
    foreign invasion, internal rivalries, and simple bad luck.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="DalelandsCampaigns">Dalelands Campaigns</h2>
<p>
  The Dalelands host classic fantasy adventures and stories of brave families defending their homes
  on a dangerous frontier. In the Dalelands, the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor—filled with
  danger and mysterious magic—is never far away.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ClassicFantasyAdventure">Classic Fantasy Adventure</h3>
<p>
  The Dalelands encourages adventure in the classic heroic fantasy tradition. Here, goblin bandits
  ride worgs out of the forest to raid villages and towns. Dragons emerge from mountaintop lairs to
  hunt for food and plunder. Every village has an inn or tavern where a retired adventurer tells
  stories about the treasure that got away. Greedy empires threaten the borders, evil mercenaries
  scheme in the shadows, and any cellar could have a door to the Underdark.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AMysteriousFrontier">A Mysterious Frontier</h3>
<p>
  Frontiers might seem hard to find in the Forgotten Realms, where every acre of land has been home
  to multiple civilizations over the millennia. The Dalelands offer can-do folk the opportunity to
  live in a land with few laws, where self-sufficiency is vital. But immigrants to the Dalelands
  must build their homes in the shadow of an ancient and primeval forest filled with monsters and
  long-forgotten magic. Life in the Dalelands is hard, but the people here are determined to defend
  it.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="MythDrannor">Myth Drannor</h3>
<p>
  The ancient elven city of Myth Drannor lies at the heart of the Dalelands. Once a magical
  metropolis, Myth Drannor was abandoned centuries ago, and the magical protection known as a mythal
  that lies at its heart is failing. Myth Drannor is a megadungeon: an adventure site so large that
  no single party of adventurers could hope to explore it all. Instead, adventurers gather
  information on the ruined city, explore a region until resources run out, and then return home to
  rest and sell their loot to fund their next round of exploration.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="Alias">

    Created by an alliance of powerful spellcasters to be a living weapon and repository of ancient
    lore, Alias appears to be human but is in fact an artificial being. Having existed for almost
    150 years, Alias long ago broke free from the magical bonds placed on her when she was created
    and lives a life of heroic adventure as a principled mercenary and wandering sage. She often
    travels with her lifelong friend and companion Dragonbait (described in the D&D adventure
    <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/toa">Tomb of Annihilation</a>).

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="PeopleoftheDalelands">People of the Dalelands</h2>
<p>
  Although Dalefolk are a diverse lot, and the Dalelands isn’t a unified kingdom like Cormyr and
  Sembia, Dalefolk share a history and culture that has remained steady across the centuries. To an
  outsider, Dalefolk seem closemouthed, suspicious, and reserved. Until newcomers are identified as
  friends or foes, Dalefolk prefer civil silence to empty pleasantries. However, Dalefolk are open
  and giving, especially in the common defense. Those accepted as friends by Dalefolk are expected
  to contribute to the defense of the community; life is dangerous out on the Cormanthor frontier,
  and everyone’s expected to pull their weight.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ALandBornfromUnity">A Land Born from Unity</h3>
<p>
  The Dalelands were born out of an agreement between elves of
  <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a> and human refugees from the east and south, and this remains
  a key element of Dalelands culture. Although most elves have left Cormanthor for the remote island
  of Evermeet, Dalefolk still largely honor the Dales Compact.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to the establishment of the Dales Compact, refugees from lands torn by war and disaster were
  desperate for a place to live, and they eagerly agreed to the pact. But elves of Cormanthor had a
  different perspective on the Dales Compact. They viewed the influx of newcomers to the lands
  surrounding the forest as an inevitability. Thus, the Dales Compact was a means for elves to head
  off conflict with the Dalefolk, as any such conflict might overwhelm even the magic of
  <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the centuries since the creation of the Dales Compact, the tenuous alliance evolved into a true
  partnership. The Dalefolk’s adherence to the terms of the Dales Compact assuaged the elves’ fears
  of conquest, and in time the two sides formed a strong alliance. Elves fought alongside human
  heroes when Myth Drannor fell, and humans have earned their respect. Elves who remain in
  Cormanthor still work alongside Dalefolk to defend the region against threats.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="PeopleofManySpecies">People of Many Species</h3>
<p>
  In the years since the Dales Compact was forged, the Dalelands has become home to diverse peoples.
  In particular, nomadic halflings known as lightfoots have embraced the importance of home and
  family in the Dalelands, moving here in large numbers.
</p>
<p>
  Dwarves have old roots in <a href="#Daggerdale">Daggerdale</a>, which lies closest of the dales to
  the lost dwarven land of Tethyamar. Dwarves of the Brightblade clan, refugees from Tethyamar,
  settled in Daggerdale long ago and spread throughout the Dalelands, founding villages like Glen in
  <a href="#Mistledale">Mistledale</a>. Trade with dwarves who live deep in the Underdark provides a
  valuable financial lifeline for the Dalelands’ largest towns.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#HighDale">High Dale’s</a> gnomes hid from the eyes of strangers for many centuries, but
  recently a generation of curious young gnomes ventured out and, with a little ingenuity, rekindled
  High Dale’s old copper mines. This has in turn led to strangers being welcomed into the village of
  <a href="#HiddenVale">Hidden Vale</a> for the first time.
</p>
<p>
  Orcs have lived along the banks of the <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a> for centuries,
  fishing, ferrying travelers across the river, and defending their homes. Over the last two decades
  orcs have increasingly sought their fortune in settlements throughout the dales, including
  <a href="#Shadowdale">Shadowdale</a>, the struggling community of
  <a href="#Freedale">Freedale</a>, and larger <a href="#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a>, where the
  orc priest Sigora Swordwise maintains a shrine to Tempus.
</p>
<p>
  Folk of many other species are found in the Dalelands, albeit in smaller numbers. The land is home
  to a few dragonborn and tieflings, and it’s not unusual for a goliath to wander down out of the
  Thunder Peaks, or for aasimar to appear among families of the Dales that are devoted followers of
  Lathander, Chauntea, and other benevolent deities.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TownandCountry">Town and Country</h3>
<p>
  Dalefolk can be broadly divided into two groups who intermingle. The first group, exemplified by
  the folk of <a href="#Battledale">Battledale</a> and <a href="#Featherdale">Featherdale</a>, leads
  a rural lifestyle focused on farming, ranching, and life in the wilderness. For these Dalefolk,
  the only settlement worth visiting is the nearest village, and they know by name everyone who
  lives within a day’s travel.
</p>
<p>
  The second group is newer, centered around the urban culture found in larger settlements such as
  <a href="#Archenbridge">Archenbridge</a> and <a href="#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a>. Dalefolk
  in these towns are protected by stout stone walls and can join craft or merchant guilds.
</p>
<p>
  Dalefolk from the country and Dalefolk from towns disagree on how to live in the Dalelands. To
  Dalefolk from the country, townsfolk have given up the solitude, independence, and freedom that
  brought settlers to the Dalelands in the first place. To Dalefolk from towns, country folk choose
  to live in hardship, vulnerable to everything from raiders to wandering owlbears. While Dalefolk
  from the country and town might not always agree, they come together when danger threatens—after
  all, they’re all Dalefolk.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="TheDalesCouncil">The Dales Council</h3>
<p>
  Each year at Midwinter, every dale sends a delegate to a selected Dalelands town for the Dales
  Council. Delegates debate issues affecting the dales, such as defense, border disputes, resistance
  to Zhentarim or Sembian aggression, trade deals, and matters relating to the great forest of
  Cormanthor. Delegates and their staff engage in backroom deals, negotiation, and intrigues,
  pursuing their personal interests and the interests of their dales.

<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="CormanthorandMythDrannor">Cormanthor and Myth Drannor</h2>
<p>
  Walking beneath Cormanthor’s giant maples and towering oaks, explorers enter an ancient, verdant,
  and mysterious world. The borders of Cormanthor have shrunken slightly over the years—as Dalefolk
  families have cut back the forest to make room for farms, ranches, and towns—but Cormanthor
  remains one of the mightiest forests in Faerûn. And at the forest’s heart lies the elven city of
  Myth Drannor.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Cormanthor">Cormanthor</h3>
<p>
  Most of the elves who once lived in Cormanthor left long ago. The majority of those who remain
  reside in the forest settlements of Semberholme and Tangled Trees. In the last decade or so,
  refugees from the second fall of Myth Drannor have also settled in Semberholme.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LakeSember">Lake Sember</h4>
<p>
  The beautiful freshwater lake called Lake Sember, in southern Cormanthor, is sacred to the elves
  of the forest. Guards from Semberholme protect the lake, and few outsiders are permitted to visit.
  More than a thousand years ago, sea elves (detailed in
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dnd/motm"
    >Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a
  >) settled Lake Sember, building a fabulous city of towers beneath its surface. Legends hold that
  the elves of Myth Drannor buried their dead in the cold waters of Lake Sember, but no outsider has
  verified these stories and the elves say nothing.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MoandersRoad">Moander’s Road</h4>
<p>
  For centuries, <a href="#MoanderGodofRot">Moander</a>—god of corruption and rot—was thought dead.
  But about 150 years ago, the hero known as Alias accidentally awoke the deity, who plowed a course
  of devastation toward the ruin of Myth Drannor. Moander intended to absorb the uncontrolled magic
  within the elven city, but Alias and her allies defeated him. The path of destruction the deity
  carved through Cormanthor is now known as Moander’s Road.
</p>
<p>
  For decades, Moander’s stinking corpse rotted in the forest. But this god of rot was born again in
  the Second Sundering. Now Moander’s corrupting presence pervades the Dalelands, particularly in
  places such as the Rotting Gorge in <a href="#Deepingdale">Deepingdale</a>. The high hill where
  the corpse once lay is now empty, but the road and the woods around it are filled with strange
  fungi, loathsome oozes, and plant monsters, including [monsters]Spore of Moander;Spores of
  Moander[/monsters].
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Semberholme">Semberholme</h4>
<p>
  Towering trees fed by Lake Sember’s pure waters soar high above the city of Semberholme, creating
  a cathedral-like retreat for those elves who remain in Cormanthor. Limestone caves beneath the
  city provide access to Lake Sember and serve as an emergency redoubt and storage area. Ilsivele
  Miritar, who led the restoration of Myth Drannor a century ago, and her husband, a resurrected
  hero named Fflar Melruth (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Questing Knight[/monsters]), rule
  Semberholme, but the second fall of Myth Drannor has darkened their spirits Ilsivele and Fflar
  have abandoned all hope of returning to Myth Drannor, and they have resigned themselves to
  lingering in Semberholme, perpetually mourning the lost glory of ages past.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="StandingStone">Standing Stone</h4>
<p>
  When the elves of Cormanthor and refugees from war-torn lands formed the Dales Compact, they
  erected the Standing Stone in the forest to commemorate the pact. Elven runes winding around the
  glossy, gray stone detail the formation of the Dales Compact and its rules. The stone magically
  repairs any damage to itself, so the runes are still readable.
</p>
<p>
  The Standing Stone is one of the most important monuments in Daleland culture. Many Dalefolk take
  a pilgrimage to the stone to read its inscriptions. But despite roads that lead through
  Cormanthor, the journey to the Standing Stone can be perilous, and travelers must be prepared to
  face bugbears, gnolls, wild animals, [monsters]Ettercap;Ettercaps[/monsters], and
  <strong>[monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TangledTrees">Tangled Trees</h4>
<p>
  High above Cormanthor’s floor spreads a network of interlocking bridges, wooden platforms, and
  tree forts surrounded by nets of strong but delicate rope. This is the settlement of Tangled
  Trees, which is home to both Cormanthor and Dalefolk scouts.
</p>
<p>
  In the warmer months, the inhabitants of Tangled Trees venture into the forest. They patrol the
  roads, trails, and paths that crisscross through the woods, and every year at least one group
  travels to Myth Drannor to inspect the borders of the ancient city and look for threats that might
  have emerged there. As winter draws near, these expedition parties return to Tangled Trees to rest
  and prepare for the year to come.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</h3>
<p>
  Myth Drannor was once the greatest city in Faerûn, a magical metropolis constructed by elves but
  home to people of all species, invited into Cormanthor on the establishment of the Dales Compact.
  However, Myth Drannor fell eight hundred years ago, torn by internal strife, wracked by magical
  experiments gone awry, and finally invaded by an army of fiends.
</p>
<p>
  A little over a century ago, Cormanthor elves reopened Myth Drannor and restored the mythal that
  protected the city. Myth Drannor stood on the threshold of a golden age. But instead, war with the
  Shadovar led to the flying city of Thultanthar crashing into the city in 1487. The mythal failed
  again, and the wreckage of Thultanthar made the ruins of Myth Drannor more dangerous and
  unpredictable than ever. The damage was so extensive that no one knows whether the mythal can be
  repaired again.
</p>
<p>
  The city can be divided into two halves. To the west lie neighborhoods built prior to the Dales
  Compact, including the Old City, the Lake Ward (where elves lived in elegant and palatial homes),
  and the Temple Ward. To the east lies the Dlabraddath, an expansion to the city designed to
  accommodate the influx of Dalefolk. Streams running north to south separate these two regions, and
  many bridges cross these streams to connect the two halves of the city.
</p>
<p>
  Over centuries, researchers in Myth Drannor conducted extensive magical experiments and spent
  resources on a scale found nowhere else on Faerûn. Not all these experiments are recorded, and
  many still stand as broken monuments, their magic warped by centuries of neglect. Explorers in
  Myth Drannor could stumble on fantastic magic of any kind: massive magical highways that allow
  instant travel across Faerûn, portals to anywhere in the Great Wheel (and even beyond), or even
  structures designed to manipulate time.
</p>
<p>
  The fall of Myth Drannor created regions of dead magic within the city; see the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> for the rules for dead magic
  zones. While the largest dead magic zones in the city remain relatively stable in permanent
  locations, smaller dead magic zones move throughout the city in unpredictable patterns.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TheMythal">The Mythal</h4>
<p>
  Myth Drannor was protected by powerful magic called a mythal, which extended the lives of the
  city’s inhabitants, controlled the weather, and had other wondrous uses, ensuring Myth Drannor
  remained a magical paradise. After the first fall of Myth Drannor, the mythal eventually
  deteriorated, its magical effects becoming unpredictable and strange. It was restored for a time
  in the last century, but when the Shadovar city of Thultanthar crashed into Myth Drannor, the
  mythal failed again, this time perhaps beyond repair.
</p>
<p>
  The mythal now has powerful but unreliable magical effects. Most notably, it blocks most
  teleportation in or out of Myth Drannor (but not within the city walls) and blocks divination
  effects such as scrying. It sometimes protects falling creatures from harm and can extend the
  duration of light-creating spells. But it has also caused strange mutations in those exposed to it
  for more than a few months. The effects of the malfunctioning mythal are impossible to predict.
</p>
<p>
  Any attempt to restore Myth Drannor ultimately depends on repairing the mythal. But no one’s sure
  how to accomplish this, or if it’s even possible.
</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="Megadungeons">
  <p>Megadungeons</p>
  <p>
    Before the creation of D&D, the first dungeons took shape as sprawling tunnel networks beneath
    Castle Blackmoor and Castle Greyhawk. Adventurers explored these fantastic labyrinths one level
    at a time, retreating when resources ran low or after encountering monsters too powerful to
    overcome. Between delves into the dungeon, characters went on other adventures. Fantastic
    adventure sites like this became known as megadungeons.
  </p>
  <p>
    The abandoned elven city of Myth Drannor is an example of a megadungeon. For guidance on
    adventuring in Myth Drannor, see “<a href="#DalelandsStories">Dalelands Stories</a>” later in

</aside>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LocationsinMythDrannor">Locations in Myth Drannor</h4>
<p>
  Myth Drannor is a vast and expansive city that could provide years of adventure. Only a few of its
  locations are detailed here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Burial Glen.</em></strong> Myth Drannor’s primary cemetery lies outside the walls to
  the west, along a path leading to the city gates. For many adventurers, this is where explorations
  of Myth Drannor begin. Anyone attempting to plunder the crypts must contend with
  [monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters], [monsters]Skeleton;Skeletons[/monsters], and
  [monsters]Zombie;Zombies[/monsters] that infest the glen. A triumphal arch in the center of the
  glen is home to a [monsters]Demilich[/monsters], all that remains of the legendary military
  strategist Remarkus.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dlabraddath.</em></strong> The eastern end of Myth Drannor was built to accommodate
  the influx of people that followed the establishment of the Dales Compact. The architecture here
  stands in contrast to the tall marble spires of the Old City; instead, square brick buildings, low
  houses, and buildings with round doors and windows stand arranged around parks and gardens, linked
  by broad granite roads or waterways. In addition to homes and townhouses, the Dlabraddath boasted
  numerous inns, taverns, and shops.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Dwarven Dungeons.</em></strong> Dwarf immigrants constructed a three-level
  labyrinthine city beneath Myth Drannor, a settlement known as the Dwarven Dungeons. In the
  centuries since, these tunnels have become home to a bewildering array of dangerous inhabitants,
  including lizardfolk, malevolent undead, and restless spirits of Myth Drannor’s citizens that are
  eager to resolve unfinished business and end their haunting. The Cult of the Dragon, led by the
  [monsters]Dracolich[/monsters] Pelendralaar, controlled the Dwarven Dungeons for many years;
  although Pelendralaar was defeated and the cult routed, the dracolich’s return is inevitable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Glim-Gardens.</em></strong> This large park used to magically heal the bodies and
  nourish the spirits of the city’s residents. Over time, however, the magic of the gardens has
  become corrupted. Now the park’s magic makes wounds reopen, bleed, and fester. Long overgrown, the
  plants of the Glim-Gardens have become hungry for flesh and thirsty for blood.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hall of Wizards.</em></strong> Myth Drannor had many magic academies, where
  spellcasters of all kinds could gather, share their knowledge, select and train apprentices, and
  push the boundaries of magical research. The oldest and most famous of these academies was the
  Hall of Wizards, legendary home of elven magical traditions. This academy contains many magically
  concealed chambers that have avoided plundering. A magical orrery on the college’s grounds can be
  used to teleport anywhere in the city.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>House of Gems.</em></strong> A stout keep marks the headquarters for the city’s
  jeweler’s guild. The House of Gems was also home to one of the city’s oldest communities of
  dwarves. Scholars of Myth Drannor suspect the House of Gems is warded with extensive magical and
  mechanical traps, as well as protected by
  <strong>[monsters]Iron Golem;Iron Golems[/monsters].</strong> Doors in the guildhall’s basement
  lead to the Dwarven Dungeons.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Old City.</em></strong> In the oldest parts of Myth Drannor, the estates of noble
  families rise intermingled with administrative buildings. Castle Cormanthor, which once housed the
  rulers of the city and ambassadors from across Faerûn, lies ruined in the center of the Old City,
  wrecked by the Netherese flying city Thultanthar.
</p>
<p>
  As Thultanthar fell from the sky, pieces of the vessel fell on the Old City like meteors,
  clustering around Castle Cormanthor in the city’s center where aberrant monsters and other strange
  creatures have become increasingly common.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Temple of Sehanine Moonbow.</em></strong> The city’s temple to Sehanine Moonbow, an
  elven god of dreams, death, and the moon was built near Castle Cormanthor in the Old City. The
  temple is a relatively modest open structure with a dome supported by columns covering a central
  altar with nearby housing for priests. It’s remarkably well preserved, though weathered by rain.
</p>
<p>
  As Myth Drannor fell to an army of fiends, priests of Sehanine withdrew to this temple and worked
  high magic to conceal it behind powerful illusions. It remains hidden to this day, appearing to
  explorers as an empty lot.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, the temple remains intact, protected by a [spells]Hallow[/spells] spell that wards
  against Aberrations and Fiends. Additionally, no sound can emanate from the temple, and sounds
  from outside the temple can’t penetrate it. These protections make the temple an excellent place
  for adventurers investigating Myth Drannor to hide, rest, and recover.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tower of Bones.</em></strong> On the north side of Myth Drannor, on the site of an
  ancient assault on the city, lies a massive war memorial. Crypts large and small lie scattered
  around a hill that marks a mass grave. Later, necromancers built the Tower of Bones atop the hill
  to facilitate their unwholesome magical experiments. By night, undead wander the region.

    <strong><a href="#Tasseldale">Tasseldale.</a></strong> Tasseldale is famous for its swordsmiths
    and for training lawyers and judges.
  </p>
</aside>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Archendale">Archendale</h3>
<p>
  The most militant region in the Dalelands is also one of the wealthiest. Archendale is the first
  stop for trade between the Dalelands and Sembia—or for Sembia’s periodic invasions—and a place
  where traditional Dalelands occupations like farmer and hunter give way to merchant and soldier.
</p>
<p>
  The people of Archendale believe mercantile and military strength together keep Archendale safe
  from longtime rivals Sembia and Tasseldale. This principle created a culture in which the people
  of Archendale pursue power and wealth at all costs, fearing the consequences of losing either.
</p>
<p>
  Archendale’s rulers are the Swords, masked individuals who keep their identities a mystery. A
  generation ago, the Swords of that time were overthrown and cast out, but the dale’s wealthy and
  well-armed families couldn’t agree on a replacement government. Finally, three new Swords
  presented themselves at <a href="#Swordpoint">Swordpoint</a> a few years ago, and the dale
  accepted their rule.
</p>
<p>
  The Archenriders are the dale’s primary defenders, six hundred well-equipped warriors divided into
  ten squadrons that patrol the River Arkhen looking for spies, outlaws, or anyone else who needs a
  lesson in Archendale justice. The Archenriders’ enforcement of the border between Archendale and
  Sembia has cemented their reputation as one of the most fearsome military forces in the Dalelands.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Archenbridge">Archenbridge</h4>
<p>
  Archenbridge is a heavily fortified town that boasts a stone wall surrounding a cramped inner
  neighborhood known as the Central Ward. Here, many-storied townhouses flank cobblestone streets
  busy with traffic from the rest of the Dalelands and from Sembia. The doors to these buildings
  feature arrow slits and barred windows, and even these ordinary homes are trapped with pits,
  murder holes, and other deadly devices.
</p>
<p>
  Many citizens of Archenbridge are merchant-adventurers eager for battle and gold. Due to the
  wealth its citizens bring in, the town is remarkably cosmopolitan, attracting a diverse array of
  shops, taverns, and crafters. The town is dedicated to Lathander but also boasts a famous temple
  to Chauntea called the Bounty of the Goddess.
</p>
<p>
  Archenbridge has spilled outside its walls; residents unable to afford property in the central
  ward built wooden homes and shops outside. When enemies threaten Archenbridge, these outbuildings
  are a liability in the town’s defense, and the Swords have ordered the entire outer town be burned
  to the ground to discourage such settlement. Outrage among Archenbridge’s less-affluent citizens,
  who live in the outer town, has so far blocked this effort.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ArchWood">Arch Wood</h4>
<p>
  Greedy merchants in Archendale have coveted the pristine forest of Arch Wood for many years, but
  Archendale’s new Swords have dictated the forest must be left untouched. That’s because, a century
  ago, early efforts to harvest trees from the forest revealed ancient ruins blossoming with rotted
  vegetation and reeking of death. These structures have since become infested with
  <a href="#MoanderGodofRot">Moander’s</a> corrupted minions, including [monsters]Shambling
  Mound;Shambling Mounds[/monsters], oozes, and even a [monsters]Spore of Moander[/monsters].
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MountThalagbror">Mount Thalagbror</h4>
<p>
  The River Arkhen begins at Arkhen Falls, where a spring on the slope of Mount Thalagbror bursts
  forth and plunges hundreds of feet. [monsters]Pegasus;Pegasi[/monsters] make their home on the
  mountain slopes and sometimes frequent the falls; this lures followers of Chauntea and Mielikki
  eager to observe the pegasi, as well as adventurers looking to tame a mount. The mountain was
  named after an [monsters]Oni[/monsters] that dwells behind the waterfall in a cave rich with
  copper and gemstones.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Swordpoint">Swordpoint</h4>
<p>
  An intimidating stone fortress called Swordpoint overlooks the town of Archenbridge. It serves as
  a garrison for the Archenriders and a home for the Swords—the dale’s three anonymous rulers.
</p>
<p>
  The castle’s stone walls have been crumbling for centuries. Nevertheless, Swordpoint’s catapults
  and ballistae, combined with its high vantage, make it one of the most formidable fortresses in
  the Dalelands. The central courtyard boasts the Shrine of Swords, dedicated to Tempus, along with
  multiple layers of supplementary defenses, such as movable wooden walls fitted with crossbows,
  moats filled with flammable oil, and rolling platforms with mounted siege weapons.
</p>
<p>
  The Swords employed a mage named Orosul to create permanent magical wards around the castle and
  treat its stone with a hardening formula derived from the blood of a gorgon. Dwarf masons hired to
  expand the castle added extensive subterranean tunnels, dungeons, and storage chambers capable of
  supplying Archenbridge for a year. At least 180 Archenriders staff the castle at all times.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="WhiteFord">White Ford</h4>
<p>
  Long ago, the folk of Archendale rolled boulders into the River Arkhen to create a ford. A
  fortified village called White Ford grew up around that ford. The village is surrounded by an oval
  stone wall called the Wolf Wall, which protects the village when goblin raiders and their worg
  allies ride down out of the Thunder Peaks. Within the wall, an inner keep called the Arch Hold is
  protected by a ditch and stone wall. A unit of sixty Archenriders is stationed at the Arch Hold.
</p>
<p>
  White Ford sees steady merchant traffic between <a href="#Highmoon">Highmoon</a> and Archenbridge.
  That’s made the folk of White Ford wealthy, though their village is far quieter than the bustling
  capital to the south.

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Battledale">Battledale</h3>
<aside class="gazeteer-quote">
  <p>
    “In a land like Battledale, where there are no laws, your friends and kin are your sword and
    your shield. A person without family—born or chosen—is victim to all of life’s mischance. And
    indeed, is this not true of all places?”
  </p>
  <p>—ALIAS</p>
</aside>
<p>
  The people of Battledale are peace-loving farmers, shepherds, and foresters of no particular
  martial skill. Unfortunately, their homes lie along a central and strategic route invaders of the
  Dalelands frequently take. Battledale is named for the many pitched battles that have taken place
  within its borders, much to the dismay of the folk who live here.
</p>
<p>
  Rauthauvyr’s Road runs through central Battledale, a key highway leading from Ordulin in the south
  to Hillsfar in the north. Dense forests, rolling hills, and pastureland flank the road. The most
  fertile part of Battledale is the Belt, a region of fenced farms and cottages, orchards, and sheep
  pastures blessed with fish-filled streams and ponds. Stone tables sacred to Chauntea line paths
  and trails; locals leave food on these tables for weary and hungry travelers. Meanwhile, followers
  of Silvanus mark that deity’s influence by stringing bells over the Belt’s many pools and woodland
  springs.
</p>
<p>
  This land is sparsely populated; the ravages of war and dangerous beasts have left many farms
  abandoned. Some former adventurers like to settle here, drawn to a fertile land and a wilderness
  that needs taming, but people who grow up in Battledale tend to leave.
</p>
<p>
  Five centuries ago, Aencar the Mantled King rose to power in Battledale and began an effort to
  unite the Dalelands. He almost succeeded. But Aencar was lured back to the Battledale town of
  Essembra, where he was ambushed by a dracolich and slain. His dream of a united Dalelands died
  with him, but the people of Battledale revere that dream and his memory.
</p>
<p>
  A few years ago, a silver-scaled dragonborn named Volsembra (Medium, Lawful Good
  [monsters]Knight[/monsters]) led a group of families back to the ruined town of Essembra, where
  she took the title of Protector of Battledale and began the town’s reconstruction. Volsembra
  commands the Spears of Battledale, a troop of one hundred [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] who
  safeguard the town and patrol Rauthauvyr’s Road.
</p>
<p>
  Battledale has no formal laws; folk tend to their own affairs. Those suspected of a crime are
  tried by their neighbors, who mete out whatever justice they think appropriate. Serious problems
  can be brought to Protector Volsembra, but she has no authority beyond the town in which she
  dwells. She hires adventurers to investigate problems brought to her attention, as she’s busy with
  the reconstruction efforts in Essembra.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AbbeyoftheSword">Abbey of the Sword</h4>
<p>
  Two centuries ago, Tempus manifested in a shattered castle; soon after, a follower of Tempus
  rebuilt some of the fortress and founded the Abbey of the Sword here. When Sembian forces invaded
  Essembra, the refugees sought shelter here, and the survivors built a town called Ambrose around
  the abbey. Now, however, Volsembra has led them back to their old homes, and Ambrose has been
  abandoned.
</p>
<p>
  The underground levels of the abbey contain portals to the Underdark through which nomadic drow
  loyal to the evil deity Vhaeraun once invaded the Dalelands. A hundred
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] who worship Tempus keep watch, but the human Priest-General Ilya
  Harndrekker (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Questing Knight[/monsters]) seeks adventurers willing
  to go through the portals and find a way to close them.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AencarsManor">Aencar’s Manor</h4>
<p>
  From Rauthauvyr’s Road, the old manor of the Mantled King appears inviting, with well-tended
  gardens overlooked by statues of mounted knights, and inner chambers lit by warm fireplaces. The
  folk of Battledale use these gardens and other areas around the manor as the site for their
  regular Shieldmeet festivals, every four years, strictly avoiding the manor’s interior.
</p>
<p>
  That’s because the interior is haunted by [monsters]Ghost;Ghosts[/monsters],
  [monsters]Specter;Specters[/monsters], [monsters]Wraith;Wraiths[/monsters] and even the restless
  corpse of Aencar (Medium [monsters]Death Knight[/monsters]). Aencar was killed by a dracolich, so
  the Cult of the Dragon has long felt entitled to Aencar’s property; they maintain a hideout in the
  manor, from which they summon and strengthen the undead that haunt it while the cult explores
  tunnels underneath the manor that connect to the Underdark.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Essembra">Essembra</h4>
<p>
  The largest settlement in Battledale is Essembra, named after a beloved adventurer who eventually
  revealed herself to be a dragon in disguise. Cottages and farms line the road leading to Battle
  Court, a walled compound encompassing about fifty buildings that includes a temple to Gond and a
  moated keep known as Ilmeth’s Manor. A statue of Aencar marks the center of the court.
</p>
<p>
  Essembra was abandoned for years after Sembians and their Shadovar allies sacked it and burned it
  to the ground. Now the dragonborn Volsembra, Protector of Battledale, leads the reconstruction
  efforts, with help from adventurers willing to clear out ruined buildings inhabited by outlaws,
  wild beasts, or restless undead. Volsembra is widely believed to be related to Essembra, but she
  refuses to discuss the matter, insisting she be judged by her deeds, not by any familial
  connection.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="GhostHolds">Ghost Holds</h4>
<p>
  The forests and hills of Battledale are filled with abandoned manors and keeps known as ghost
  holds: the former homes of settlers or wealthy Sembians who thought a vacation house in the
  Dalelands sounded like a good idea—until the Zhentarim or a rampaging [monsters]Owlbear[/monsters]
  showed up. The ghost holds now provide shelter to outlaws, foreign spies, and wild creatures.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HaptoothHill">Haptooth Hill</h4>
<p>
  A tower built by the Red Wizard Dracandros tops Haptooth Hill. Catacombs descend from the tower
  into the hill. Dracandros and his drow allies were killed by adventurers long ago, but in the
  intervening years the tower has been used by everything from Zhentarim spies to wandering
  monsters. Lately, an enterprising human Red Wizard named Pythia Vandermeer (Medium
  [monsters]Mage[/monsters]) has returned to the site, seeking Dracandros’s arcane secrets.
</p>
<p>
  Adventurers seeking to explore the hill can find the supplies and services they need in the nearby
  village of Hap, where a dozen buildings surround a shrine to Lathander overseen by the halfling
  Norin Brit (Small, Neutral Good [monsters]Priest[/monsters]).
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ThreeRivers">Three Rivers</h4>
<p>
  The fertile land where the <a href="#GlaemrilRiver">Glaemril</a> and Semberflow meet the
  <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a> is called Three Rivers. Many settler families and
  adventuring companies have perished here, for [monsters]Bulette;Bulettes[/monsters],
  [monsters]Manticore;Manticores[/monsters], [monsters]Owlbear;Owlbears[/monsters], and other
  monstrous creatures congregate in this region, which is littered with burned-out cottages and
  abandoned strongholds. Merchants seeking to use the rivers to move goods pay adventurers steep
  prices to protect their boats.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Daggerdale">Daggerdale</h3>
<p>
  Centuries ago, refugees fleeing ancient wars founded the realm of Merrydale, forging alliances
  with the dwarves of Tethyamar, which lay to the west. But a succession of disasters—including an
  infestation of vampires, occupation by the Zhentarim, and a plague of lycanthropy—left the people
  here anything but merry. Somewhere along the line they changed the realm’s name to Daggerdale, and
  the survivors became a close-knit, insular people who keep their doors locked, their mouths shut,
  and their weapons handy.
</p>
<p>
  Daggerdale lies south of the Border Forest, stretching to the Dagger River and beyond. Rolling
  plains and rocky valleys give this realm a different character than the wooded dales to the south
  and east. Families of dwarf miners, primarily the Brightblade clan, dwell in Anathar’s Dell, along
  with human and elf farmers. The village of Serpentbridge grew up around an old and unstable span
  crossing the Dagger River.
</p>
<p>
  For centuries the Morn family ruled Daggerdale. The legendary hero Randall Morn was ousted by the
  Zhentarim but led a successful rebellion, reclaiming his throne before eventually dying in his
  sleep and leaving no heir. Members of the noble family of Cormaeril, related to the Morns by
  marriage, moved into Castle Daggerdale and ruled for three generations, but the citizens of the
  dale never accepted them. Barathal Cormaeril, the last such ruler, was forced to flee when his
  sister Neranya was revealed as a werewolf.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, only a few years ago, the foremost priest at the temple of Lathander’s Light divined that
  a scion of the Morn family survived, unaware of their own bloodline. Young Kirkland Stone, the son
  of a beryl miner from the <a href="#DaggerHills">Dagger Hills</a>, was made Lord Kirkland Morn
  overnight and now rules unsteadily from Castle Daggerdale. He is idealistic but cautious, quick to
  listen to advisers but slow to make decisions. But the people of Daggerdale have embraced
  Kirkland, calling him a “True Morn” and encouraging him to marry and continue the family name.
</p>
<aside class="gazeteer-quote">
  <p>
    “Young Kirkland Stone became Lord Kirkland Morn in an instant. He did not choose the path his
    life has taken. None of us do. Now he must choose what to do with this new life.”

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BorderForest">Border Forest</h4>
<p>
  The Border Forest lies at the confluence of four realms: Daggerdale and the rest of the Dalelands
  lie to the south, the Moonsea and Zhentil Keep to the east, the Tortured Land to the north, and
  Anauroch to the west. Many fey call the forest home, but centuries of intrusion by trespassers has
  made the bullywugs, centaurs, goblins, satyrs, and worgs of the Border Forest especially ruthless.
  They prey on anyone who enters the woods.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="CastleDaggerdale">Castle Daggerdale</h4>
<p>
  Lord Kirkland Morn’s sturdy stone keep overlooks the Tethyamar Trail. Although the keep is the
  official seat of Kirkland’s rule, he brings his court with him when he travels to Dagger Falls.
  Castle Daggerdale houses over a hundred mounted soldiers known as the Morn Riders
  ([monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] riding [monsters]Warhorse;Warhorses[/monsters]); they patrol
  the roads and borders of the dale.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DaggerFalls">Dagger Falls</h4>
<p>
  The capital of Daggerdale is Dagger Falls, a former trading outpost on the northern shore of the
  River Tesh near Dagger Bridge. Sturdy stone walls and two gatehouses protect the town. The
  buildings within, also stone and covered with slate roofs, show the influence of dwarven
  engineering techniques. The only inn in town is the Fallsview, but an elf musician named Kessla
  (Medium, Neutral Good [monsters]Performer Maestro[/monsters]) runs the Red Rock Tavern. A temple
  to Lathander, Lathander’s Light, is the largest religious building in the dale; it’s managed by
  Her Radiance Dareen Travaskyr (Medium, Neutral Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]), the high elf
  priest who identified Kirkland Stone as the lost heir to the Morn legacy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Constable’s Tower.</em></strong> Daggerdale’s greatest and most imposing stronghold is
  the Constable’s Tower, which rises from a high hill in Dagger Falls called the Spur. The keep has
  been unusable for decades thanks to a mysterious magical accident that left waves of deadly spells
  coursing back and forth through the keep and its subterranean levels. Recently, adventurers
  affiliated with the Zhentarim have promised to cleanse the keep and make it usable again; Lord
</p>
<p>
  Morn has supported their efforts and given them a plot of land, which the Zhentarim have in turn
  made into a clandestine base of operations. The Zhentarim have found a secret way into the keep,
  which they use to loot it of valuables.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DaggerHills">Dagger Hills</h4>
<p>
  The steep and rugged Dagger Hills are broken by thorn-choked ravines and hidden glens. Paths are
  hard to find and even harder to follow, and the Dagger Hills are infamously home to
  [monsters]Wereboar;Wereboars[/monsters] and
  <strong>[monsters]Werewolf;Werewolves[/monsters].</strong> Nevertheless, the hills are key to
  Daggerdale’s prosperity, as they are a famous source for emeralds, aquamarines, and other gems.
  Shepherds and goatherds also keep their flocks here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hidden Menace.</em></strong> The Dagger Hills hide a threat to Lord Morn’s rule:
  Neranya Cormaeril, the werewolf heir to the Cormaeril claim on Daggerdale, still lives. She leads
  a pack of werewolves and nurses a grudge against Kirkland Morn.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mysterious Ruin.</em></strong> The White Crag is an ancient ruin carved out of the
  side of one of the Dagger Hills. The structure is incredibly ancient, predating even the elven
  settlement of <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>, but scholars can’t agree if it was created by
  giants or dragons. Tunnels underneath the ruin descend to the Underdark.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DesertsmouthMountains">Desertsmouth Mountains</h4>
<p>
  Fearsome dragons and giants lair in the mighty Desertsmouth Mountains and forage out of them for
  food. Daggerdale miners have worked the edge of these mountains for generations, long after the
  dwarves of Tethyamar were routed by an army of demons led by evil wizards (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof/a-guide-to-the-realms/">chapter 2</a> of
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof">Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn).</a>

<a href="/sources/dnd/frhof">
  <p>
    Many dwarf families of Daggerdale dream of returning to Tethyamar and restoring its splendor.
    The Zhentarim moved into the old mines some time ago, but the tunnels are home to some of the
    most dangerous monsters in Faerûn. The Zhents avoid the more dangerous subterranean regions, but
    as they ransack safer parts of the complex, they send their plunder in wagons back to Zhentil
    Keep.

    A strategic lookout point on a rocky knoll above Dagger Falls, Eagle’s Aerie was used by Randall

    from this key vantage. Kirkland Morn uses the lookout as a private, personal refuge from affairs
    of state.

  <h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Deepingdale">Deepingdale</h3>
  <p>
    Deepingdale was founded by a sorcerer named Imryll Eluarshee, who is known as the Deeping
    Princess. More than any other dale, Deepingdale is dedicated to respecting the forest and living
    in it without destroying it. Most families in Deepingdale include both humans and elves, and the
    dale boasts a small community of drow who worship Eilistraee and other good gods.
  </p>
  <p>
    The people of Deepingdale are foresters, hunters, trappers, and rangers; the forest provides
    everything they need, so long as they don’t abuse it or take its gifts for granted. Deepingdale
    families value learning, song, and martial skill. They take a long view when it comes to crises
    and emergencies, arguing that problems often resolve themselves if left alone; but when they’re
    proven wrong, Deepingdale folk swiftly rise to the occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dale is organized around the East Way, a major trade road connecting Cormyr and Sembia.
    Merchants from both realms make the markets in Highmoon among the most popular in the Dalelands.
    The villages Bristar and Moonrise Hill lie north of the road, deep in the forest. Hamlets and
    smaller groupings of family homes lie scattered throughout the dale, especially in the eaves
    along the forest edge.

</a>
<p>
  <a href="/sources/dnd/frhof">The high elf Lord Theremen Ulath (Medium, Neutral Good </a

  <strong><em>Leaves of Learning.</em></strong> The Leaves of Learning is a temple to Oghma that
  houses one of the most famous libraries in Faerûn. The library, held in a great spire that
  overlooks even the Tower of the Rising Moon, specializes in mundane topics; this has spared the
  library from intrusion by rapacious wizards and power-hungry invaders. Unfortunately, the
  library’s index, a single massive volume bound with gold and encrusted with gems, was recently
  stolen—a grievous blow to both the library’s reputation and its usefulness. The human priest
  Thanali (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]) oversees the temple and has given up
  on locating the index, since any reward she can offer would be but a fraction of what the book is
  worth. Her only hope now is to find adventurers who revere Oghma and will recover the book out of
  religious obligation.

<p>
  <strong><em>Rhauntides’s Tower.</em></strong> Once home to the wizard Rhauntides, who held the
  post of Sage of Deepingdale, this small hexagonal tower atop Spell Hill in Highmoon was willed to
  a warrior monk named Teesha Than when Rhauntides died. Teesha founded a monastery in the tower,
  and monks reside there still, practicing their fighting arts and welcoming a few new students
  every year. The basement levels of the tower descend into the hill; they hold the remnants of
  Rhauntides’s dangerous arcane experiments.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tower of the Rising Moon.</em></strong> Among its many landmarks, Highmoon is the site
  of the Tower of the Rising Moon, home to Lord Ulath. Ulath’s hospitality is well known, and the
  tower is famous as a site for feasting, music, and other entertainments, not as a military
  fortress. This frivolous reputation belies Ulath’s wise leadership, however. Ulath traditionally
  keeps an adviser trained in the arcane arts, the so-called Sage of Deepingdale. Unfortunately, no
  one has been able to hold this title for long, dying by accident, on adventure, or from
  assassination. The position has acquired a dire reputation, and Ulath can no longer find anyone
  willing to accept the job.

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="RottingGorge">Rotting Gorge</h4>
<p>
  South of the Semberflow, hidden by dense forest, lies a deep rift in the earth called the Rotting
  Gorge, sheltered by twisted trees and knotted vines. On this site, elf wizards long ago used high
  magic to imprison an aspect of <a href="#MoanderGodofRot">Moander</a>, the horrifying god of rot,
  decay, and corruption. The people of Deepingdale consider this place, which they once called the
  Darkwatch, to be cleansed.
</p>
<p>
  But Moander’s evil legacy was never entirely destroyed, and with Moander’s return after the Second
  Sundering, his grip on the Rotting Gorge has reawoken. Now this chasm is filled with malignant
  magic. [monsters]Shambling Mound;Shambling Mounds[/monsters] and [monsters]Gibbering
  Mouther;Gibbering Mouthers[/monsters] are among the least of the evils that crawl forth from the
  Rotting Gorge. More dangerous are the [monsters]Spore of Moander;Spores of Moander[/monsters] born

  The realm of Sessrendale was destroyed centuries ago by <a href="#Archendale">Archendale</a> in a

  Archendale’s mercenaries razed everything to the ground and salted the earth to discourage
  refugees from returning. The folk of Sessrenglade were diligent miners, but now open pits and
  dangerous shafts are all that remain of their labor.
</p>
<p>
  Few travel this devastated land, but that made it all the more appealing to Thraxata, an
  [monsters]Adult Red Dragon[/monsters] that lairs in Blood Peak, a mountain overlooking
  Sessrenglade. Adventurers seeking to slay Thraxata must first contend with the
  [monsters]Revenant;Revenants[/monsters] that haunt the ruined town, and this has allowed the

  Featherdale encompasses the flat and fertile farmland on either side of the

  standing army, and no capital.
</p>
<p>
  Emergencies and long-simmering regional affairs are addressed at a Dalemeet: a gathering of family
  elders and prominent business leaders at Feather Falls or Blackfeather Bridge. Whoever shows up
  for the Dalemeet debates any issues brought forward, attempting to persuade others in attendance
  or forge a consensus. Any decision must be enforced by the winning party, as the dale has no
  constable or other law enforcement body. Family ties, friendships, and reciprocal relationships
  are crucial to getting things done in Featherdale. Crime is dealt with through vigilante justice,
  resulting in feuds between families that go back generations.
</p>
<p>
  The lack of military defenses throughout Featherdale makes the realm an easy target for invaders,
  but the people of Featherdale aren’t rich, and they have little to arouse the envy of wealthy
  Sembian nobles. The wide river plain, however, makes an excellent highway to more lucrative
  targets, so armies frequently sweep through Featherdale en route to those targets. These armies
  don’t linger long, as all are eventually driven out by the forces of more militant dales.
</p>
<p>
  Featherdale is a good neighbor to the other dales, its people have family ties throughout the
  Dalelands, and they are a reliable and prudent voice on the Dales Council. When Featherdale is in
  need, the goodwill they have earned is repaid to them. In the meantime, they keep their heads
  down. Many of the families in Featherdale trace their origin to adventurers who retired to the
  dale, leaving a life of danger behind in favor of home and family. This legacy contributes to the
  idiosyncratic political views of Featherdale folk, but it also means many a house, ranch, farm,
  and cottage has a magic item stowed away for emergencies—and someone ready to use it to defend
  their home.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BlackfeatherBridge">Blackfeather Bridge</h4>
<p>
  One of the few bridges across the wide River Ashaba, Blackfeather Bridge originally was a humble,
  long, and sturdy wooden bridge painted black to give a false impression of stability. Eventually
  Featherdale raised enough money from tolls to pay for a stone replacement, and that wider bridge
  stands today. The village named after the bridge is one of Featherdale’s two largest settlements,
  the other being Feather Falls on the opposite end of the dale.
</p>
<p>
  The deity Cyric killed Leira, god of deception, on the original wooden Blackfeather bridge over a
  century ago. Leira eventually returned, but the bustling bridge has become a pilgrimage site for
  Cyric’s faith. The village employs no guards, so these evil pilgrims usually go undetected amid
  the bridge’s daily traffic. They don’t conduct schemes in the village, as that would attract
  attention and endanger their holy site, but they use the bridge as a rendezvous point where they
  exchange news and hatch schemes enacted elsewhere in the Heartlands.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="FeatherFalls">Feather Falls</h4>
<p>
  Feather Falls refers to both a waterfall over which the River Ashaba plunges and the village
  situated at the waterfall’s summit. This village is one of the largest and oldest settlements in
  the dale and a traditional mooring place for local keelboats. In addition to Cholandrothipe’s
  Tower (see below), which overlooks the falls, the village includes the House of Morning, one of
  the only temples in the dale. The House of Morning is dedicated to Lathander and overseen by a
  human named Shervin (Medium, Neutral Good [monsters]Priest[/monsters]).
</p>
<p>
  A portage path winds alongside the falls, where individuals can earn a living transporting cargo.
  Behind the waterfall lies a series of hidden grottoes referred to as the Temple behind the Falls.
  No one is quite sure what entity was once worshiped in these grottoes, but its evil reputation is
  spread in stories told round the campfire or when parents want to frighten disobedient children.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Cholandrothipe’s Tower.</em></strong> Cholandrothipe was a wizard who used his mighty
  magic to move heavily laden boats safely over Feather Falls. He charged a sizable fee for this
  service, but merchants paid it anyway to save the considerable time, labor, and money portage
  otherwise required. The wizard dwelled in a tall, slender tower with a single porch-like entrance,
  and no one was permitted entry.
</p>
<p>
  But Cholandrothipe concealed many secrets, and he drew the attention of Red Wizards who killed him
  and set his tower aflame. Subterranean levels beneath the tower house dreadful dungeons and
  tunnels to the Underdark, still guarded by deadly traps and magical Constructs, but
  Cholandrothipe’s wealth continues to lure adventurers. Some of these adventurers are affiliated
  with the Red Wizards, though they conceal that allegiance from vengeful villagers.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</h4>
<p>
  The River Ashaba is the primary thoroughfare of <a href="#Featherdale">Featherdale</a>; families
  along the shore keep keelboats for travel, communication, and recreation. The river has a history
  of flooding, but Featherdale keeps the Ashaba contained with a combination of dikes, stone walls,
  and magic.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, an enterprising, old halfling named Marco Paroland (Small, Chaotic Neutral
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]) has commissioned a wide, flat-bottomed riverboat and packed it with
  a bar, gambling tables, a stage, and other entertainments. A few staterooms are available for
  high-paying customers. This boat, which Marco dubbed the <em>Ashaban Princess</em>, sails between
  Feather Falls and Blackfeather Bridge. It’s proven a considerable boost to the economy of both
  Featherdale villages, drawing travelers and gamblers from throughout the dales.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="WrightsFerry">Wright’s Ferry</h4>
<p>
  The small hamlet of Wright’s Ferry lies halfway between Blackfeather Bridge and Feather Falls. A
  horse ferry has operated here for generations, and the hamlet is surrounded by orchards and pig
  farms. The real landmark, however, is the collection of eleven standing stones known as the
  Chessmen of Valsprendar. The stones mark the burial site of Valsprendar, a powerful wizard who
  enchanted the stones so they can be moved with the slightest touch. When moved, each stone summons
  a deadly monster. But if moved in the proper pattern, the stones open a portal to Valsprendar’s
  former sanctum, and improbable stories are told about the magical treasures therein.
</p>
<p>
  The Chessmen has become a holy place for followers of the Red Knight, and a war priest calling
  herself Elaine of Valsprendar has moved into Wright’s Ferry to watch over the site.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Harrowdale">Harrowdale</h3>
<p>
  The oldest of the dales, Harrowdale was founded over a thousand years ago by an adventurer named
  Velar, and for centuries this realm was called Velardale. But a cruel tyrant named Halvan rose to
  power and used dale labor to cut a path through <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a> to
  <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>. Ostensibly intended to forge a new trade route to
  Hillsfar, the Halfaxe Trail—as this road came to be known—would have allowed Halvan to plunder the
  great elf city at the heart of the woods, but the city’s defenders killed him instead.
</p>
<p>
  After Halvan’s death, the dale chose a new form of government: the Council of Seven Burghers, made
  up of the wealthiest individuals in the dale. The council renamed the realm Harrowdale in an
  attempt to break with the past. Decades ago, a temporary alliance with fey living in Cormanthor
  led the burghers to pave the old Halfaxe Trail into a road to Myth Drannor they named the Harrow
  Ride, but the road was soon abandoned, and its stones became overgrown and cracked. Now the ride
  serves as little more than a dangerous invitation to adventurers. Harrowdale has laws against
  chopping down the trees of Cormanthor, and the folk here have a phrase for those who, like Halvan,
  trespass too far into the forest; such people are said to be “deep in the Green.”
</p>
<p>
  Harrowdale farms, orchards, and vineyards are broken up by hedgerows and crumbling stone walls
  left behind by long-forgotten builders. Besides Harrowdale Town on the coast, the dale includes
  the villages and hamlets of Dead Oak, Lanfroe, and Velartree. Harrowdale had a period of
  tremendous growth when <a href="#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a>, wracked by invasion and the
  <a href="#ShakingPlague">Shaking Plague</a>, descended into chaos and refugees fled here. Although
  the dale has returned to the quiet of its former years, the people here retain many customs
  against the spread of sickness; they practice strict personal hygiene, avoid casually touching
  each other, and wash animals before they come into contact with people.
</p>
<p>
  The only armed force in Harrowdale is a group of mounted [monsters]Scout;Scouts[/monsters] called
  the Gray Riders. They are commanded by Ellarian Dawnhorn, a grim elf warrior and spellcaster who
  has seen generations of Harrowdale folk come and go over her long life. Ellarian is infamously
  unfriendly to adventurers, considering them troublemakers who put innocent citizens in danger.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ColdField">Cold Field</h4>
<p>
  Cold Field lies between Harrowdale and <a href="#Scardale">Scardale</a>. The moor is the site of
  an ancient, cataclysmic battle. In spring and summer, when the days are long, shepherds graze
  their sheep on the Cold Field’s long grass. But in winter, when the days grow short, the restless
  spirits of slain soldiers rise from the turf as [monsters]Ghost;Ghosts[/monsters],
  [monsters]Specter;Specters[/monsters], and <strong>[monsters]Wraith;Wraiths[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HarrowdaleTown">Harrowdale Town</h4>
<p>
  When Scardale Town collapsed into chaos and lawlessness decades ago, Harrowdale Town just up the
  coast briefly supplanted it as the chief port in the Dalelands. The leaders of the town renamed it
  to New Velar, after the dale’s founder, and this time of prosperity attracted businesses to the
  town. However, the ascent of <a href="#LordKharuAumersair">Lord Kharu Aumersair</a> restored order
  to Scardale Town, allowing it to reclaim its status as the foremost port in the Dalelands.
  Although business is now diminished compared to the days of New Velar, loggers still bring their
  lumber to Harrowdale Town, selling to merchants who travel throughout Dragon’s Reach.
</p>
<p>
  The town includes temples to Oghma and Tymora. A third major temple, to Mystra, closed when New
  Velar went bust—there simply were not enough citizens left who were interested in magical study.
  High priests of Mystra throughout the Heartlands feel the closing of the temple was tragic, and
  they’re actively seeking a priest of Mystra to reopen and staff it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Halvan Manor House.</em></strong> The ancient manor house of Halvan, Harrowdale’s
  reviled former ruler, lies on the outskirts of town, surrounded by a crumbling stone wall. Halvan
  was famously rich, and folktales insist he buried his treasure in his old keep. This treasure has
  never been found. Guards have all but given up trying to keep people out; instead, they charge a
  fee of 50 GP to any group seen entering or leaving the ruins. This keeps out locals but not
  professional adventurers, who have reported all manner of deadly creatures within the keep,
  including the restless spirits of prisoners who died in Halvan’s dungeons.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Velarsburg">Velarsburg</h4>
<p>
  Velarsburg is the busy heart of Harrowdale’s logging and carpentry trades. Logging mills and
  lumberyards surround the town’s cottages and workshops. A large, muddy market space fills the
  center of the village. The threat of fire posed by mills and lumberyards has prompted the
  establishment of a permanent ten-person town watch.
</p>
<p>
  The people of Velarsburg know they can’t overwork the forests of Velarwood or Cormanthor if they
  want their livelihoods to continue, and they follow centuries of tradition that include strict
  lumber quotas and replanting. Proud of their relationship with the forest, they consider their way
  of life a model that other Dalefolk would be wise to emulate.
</p>
<p>Velarsburg is home to the Temple of the Harvest Moon and a shrine to Malar.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Temple of the Harvest Moon.</em></strong> The Temple of the Harvest Moon is an
  impressive temple to Chauntea built around an ancient spire called the Tower of the Moon. The top
  floor of this tower was torn off long ago, supposedly by a dragon; Chauntea’s priests replaced it
  with a massive copper disc depicting Toril’s moon, used magic to make the disc give off brilliant
  light, and propped it up to shine through the dale like a lighthouse. The rest of the temple, a
  massive square building with an inner courtyard, surrounds the tower.
</p>
<p>
  The folk who staff the temple spend much of their time assisting locals in planting and
  harvesting. In return, the folk of Harrowdale donate to the temple to see to the clergy’s needs.
  The temple is overseen by the wood elf Thevil Oakenstaff (Medium, Neutral Good
  [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]).
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Velarwood">Velarwood</h4>
<p>
  A dangerous forest in the heart of Harrowdale, Velarwood is home to
  [monsters]Cloaker;Cloakers[/monsters], [monsters]Stirge;Stirges[/monsters],
  [monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters], and
  <strong>[monsters]Werewolf;Werewolves[/monsters].</strong> Nevertheless, the lumber industry in
  Harrowdale depends on the Velarwood, so loggers fell trees from the edges of this forest.
</p>
<p>
  One reason this work continues despite the danger is that the loggers consider themselves
  protected by angelic guardians within the forest. These mysterious guardians are, in fact, drow
  and other elves who maintain Shadowtop Glade, a shrine to Eilistraee in the northern reaches of
  the forest. The elves dwell in caves on either side of a deep gully shielded by wide-reaching
  trees. They conceal their presence from those who work the forest but are friendly to those who
  discover their presence, as long as the strangers vow to keep the shrine’s location secret.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="HighDale">High Dale</h3>
<p>
  High Dale is one of the least-known dales, but that’s just how the people of High Dale like it.
  The dale lies along a mountain pass known as Thunder Way; this pass leads from Cormyr and the town
  of Thunderstone east through the Thunder Peaks to the town of Saerb in Sembia. Many traders take
  this route, helping to sustain High Dale.
</p>
<p>
  High Dale is sandwiched between the two great realms of Cormyr and Sembia. It is protected by
  harsh terrain, a famous company of mercenary archers, and an ancient defense treaty with Cormyr.
</p>
<p>
  Although the mountainous region High Dale occupies is plagued by snow and other harsh weather in
  the winter, most of the dale lies atop a high plateau that’s excellent for farming. Over the
  centuries, farmers have also carved terraces into the sides of the nearby mountains, further
  expanding their farms. Several small valleys branch off Thunder Way, and the people of High Dale
  make their homes there in rugged mountain cabins clustered in small groups.
</p>
<p>
  The political and administrative affairs of High Dale are managed by a high constable chosen by
  the people of the dale. The current high constable is Cordance Coppercroft, a gnome engineer who
  led the effort to revive the dale’s exhausted copper mines. High Constable Coppercroft is a
  respected but private individual; he accepted the job mostly so that people would stop pestering
  him about it. His constables gather information throughout the dale and fill out reports that he
  reads in his study. While such insular behavior might alarm the people of other dales, the folk of
  High Dale respect privacy, and they’re content to let the high constable govern as he sees fit, so
  long as everyone is left alone to pursue their lives in peace.

  <strong>[monsters]Scout Captain;Scout Captains[/monsters].</strong> The company has friendly
  relationship with High Dale and its high constables; it never takes contracts that work against

  helps the company to find recruits.

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="CopperGulp">Copper Gulp</h4>
<p>
  The copper mines in the small valley of Copper Gulp are High Dale’s primary mineral resource. For
  years, the copper was thought to be exhausted, but gnome engineers from Hidden Vale have brought
  new technologies that recently reinvigorated the mines. However, kobolds moved into the mines
  while they were abandoned and refused to leave when the mines were reopened. The kobolds retreated
  deeper into the ground but defend their claim on the mines; miners opening up new shafts face
  ambushes and cunning traps.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="DancingPlace">Dancing Place</h4>
<p>
  Eight centuries ago, more than a dozen deities manifested in a hidden valley a few miles northwest
  of High Castle, an event called the Gathering of the Gods that led to the founding of the Harpers.
  Ever since, this valley has been a pilgrimage site visited by thousands every year. It is said
  that anyone infected with a magical contagion will be cured after sleeping one night in the
  Dancing Place; these cures are said to be accompanied by visions of the gods, who assign a quest
  to the cured individual.
</p>
<p>
  Clerics of Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Selûne, and Silvanus maintain the Dancing Place, which they
  have transformed into an enormous garden. The moss-covered hill where the gathering took place is
  surrounded by a stream that threads through a ring of duskwood trees. Temples to the deities
  honored in the Dancing Place fill the valley, along with hostels and other establishments that
  cater to pilgrims. As part of the treaty with Cormyr, a war wizard is permanently stationed here.
  Over the centuries, this has become a retirement posting for distinguished war wizards too
  physically frail to go on campaign.
</p>
<p>
  The Dancing Place is well protected, though most pilgrims never notice these defenses. A group of
  druids known as the High Dance guards the valley’s borders. Harpers keep caches of vital equipment
  around the valley’s edge but don’t interact with the temples and pilgrims so as to avoid drawing
  travelers into dangerous Harper operations.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HiddenVale">Hidden Vale</h4>
<p>
  A large population of gnomes dwells in the remote valley known as Hidden Vale. In fall and winter,
  dense, swirling fog shrouds Hidden Vale, but in spring and summer, the fog retreats to reveal
  sweeping vistas of colorful alpine wildflowers. The gnomes dwell in ancestral cottages along the
  rim of the valley and traditionally kept to themselves. Over the last century, however, younger
  gnomes have increasingly left the vale, seeking new experiences in High Dale proper, and the
  families who remain in the vale have begun to welcome strangers, hoping for word of their wayward
  kin.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Highcastle">Highcastle</h4>
<p>
  The largest village in High Dale, Highcastle, has less than a thousand inhabitants. Homes and
  workshops cluster around a castle that overlooks Thunder Way and gives the village its name.
  Winters in Highcastle can be inhospitable, with heavy snow and freezing temperatures; the High
  Fire Tavern is usually the only refuge in town for winter travelers. High Constable Coppercroft
  lives in the castle with his family and a small retinue of servants and aides. The kingdom of
  Cormyr has proposed sending a Purple Dragon Knight to Highcastle to serve as an ambassador and to
  hunt on nearby Wyvernfang, but the high constable keeps rejecting their candidates.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Wyvernfang">Wyvernfang</h4>
<p>
  Located on the edge of the Thunder Peaks, the mighty mountain of Wyvernfang has long been a home
  for wyverns. Rangers climb the mountain’s slopes to hunt the creatures and harvest their poison,
  while treasure hunters try to steal the creatures’ eggs. Despite generations of such activity,
  however, the wyverns are more populous than ever. Hunters tell tales of unusually intelligent
  wyverns that rule over the others, even suggesting the wyverns construct defensive walls out of
  boulders along the mountain slopes and herd sheep in secure valleys accessible only by air. The
  Purple Dragons of Cormyr insist these reports point to
  [monsters]Werewyvern;Werewyverns[/monsters], believing the mountain might be the origin point for
  the werewyverns’ curse.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Mistledale">Mistledale</h3>
<p>
  Mistledale is considered one of the most fortunate dales. Its neighbors—Cormyr,
  <a href="#Shadowdale">Shadowdale</a>, and the elves of <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>—are
  friendly and powerful, and a meteor that crashed into the land centuries ago made it magically
  fertile. The villages of Mistledale lie along the Moonsea Ride, a trade road leading from
  Tilverton northeast through the forest of Cormanthor to Hillsfar on the Moonsea Coast. Every
  morning, thick mist rolls south from the <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a> to fill this
  valley and give the dale its name.
</p>
<p>
  Six councilors, elected from across the dale, make up a ruling body called the Council of Six.
  They in turn select another individual to act as grand councilor and command the dale’s military
  forces. The current grand councilor is Honorious Vinleaf, referred to as “Yer Honor.” Vinleaf
  handles the day-to-day administration of Mistledale, saving unusual matters for the council’s
  irregular meetings.
</p>
<p>
  The villages, hamlets, and isolated farms of Mistledale communicate via sets of bells rung in
  specific melodies to send messages up and down the valley, an especially useful communication
  method when the mist is thick. Visitors to Mistledale often mistake the melodious bells for
  dangerous fey or signals passed by highway bandits.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AbbeyoftheGoldenSheaf">Abbey of the Golden Sheaf</h4>
<p>
  Priests of Chauntea operate the Abbey of the Golden Sheaf, whose walls enclose three square miles
  divided into a dozen crop fields. Silos of grain store enough food to feed the dale for years. The
  abbot is the wood elf Starrica Windsong (Medium, Neutral Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]);
  although she isn’t one of the Council of Six, she has considerable influence. Adventurers seek her
  out for healing magic, which she bestows on adventurers who solve problems throughout the
  Dalelands. In particular, the rise of goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear raiders on the dale’s west
  border has attracted her attention.

<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Ashabenford">Ashabenford</h4>
<p>
  The capital of Mistledale, Ashabenford includes a mill, stables, brewery, and workshops. Most of
  the village lies on the east side of the river, but the White Hart Inn on the west bank caters to
  adventurers. The largest house in town is reserved for the grand councilor and serves as a meeting
  hall for the Council of Six. Other landmarks include a temple to Tyr, a shrine to Chauntea, the
  famous Ashabenford Arms hotel, and the sprawling workshop of the wizened gnome Almaestaddamir
  Auldcastle (Small, Chaotic Good [monsters]Mage[/monsters]), who has lived in Ashabenford for most
  of his long life.
</p>
<p>
  A barrack on the north end of town houses the Riders, Mistledale’s only professional military
  force. Citizens of Mistledale have pressured Vinleaf to relocate the Riders to Peldan’s Helm to
  fight off the goblinoid raiders that plague the village, but he knows cavalry would be useless
  confined within the walls of Peldan’s Helm. Instead, he keeps the Riders on alert, waiting for a
  signal to ride to Peldan’s Helm and take besieging goblins by storm. This, however, would require
  Peldan’s Helm to hold out for at least a day, and that’s not something anyone in Mistledale is
  confident of.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Barrowfield">Barrowfield</h4>
<p>
  On the west end of the dale, south of the Moonsea Ride, rise a dozen long, low hills covered in
  grass and mist. These mounds, called the Barrowfield, conceal the ancient graves of Netherese
  warrior-wizards buried here after a long-forgotten battle. Wise travelers never camp near the
  Barrowfield, pushing on no matter how late the hour. [monsters]Wight;Wights[/monsters] are common

</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BeastCountry">Beast Country</h4>
<p>
  The west edge of Mistledale, called Beast Country, has always been dangerous, but over the last
  few years, goblin raiders accompanied by wolves, worgs, and other creatures have gathered in the
  hills north of Tilver’s Gap and forged into Mistledale seeking blood and plunder. Grand Councilor
  Vinleaf has responded to this threat by calling up the militia and putting out a plea for help to
  adventurers throughout the Dalelands. Rangers, foresters, and trackers fight back against the
  goblins, but the hills are home to beasts that the goblins use magic to command.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="GalathsRoost">Galath’s Roost</h4>
<p>
  An abandoned keep stands just inside the forest of <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>. Known as
  Galath’s Roost, it has sheltered all manner of denizens over the centuries, including the bandit
  lord Galath, for whom it is named. Although Galath was slaughtered by a Sembian war party, his
  spirit ([monsters]Wraith[/monsters]) haunts the ruins. This hasn’t prevented the keep from being
  used as a base by drow infiltrators, Zhentarim smugglers, and worse. Recently, a bugbear leader
  named Zolbag led a war party from the Beast Country into Galath’s Roost. His plan is to wait for
  an attack on Peldan’s Helm to draw the dale’s military away from Ashabenford, then descend on
  Ashabenford and burn it to the ground.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Glen">Glen</h4>
<p>
  A dwarven village known as Glen lies just west of Galath’s Roost on the eastern border of
  Mistledale. Its stone cottages are simple, one-story constructions, but most include two or three
  subterranean levels, often connected to other buildings by paved and well-lit tunnels. The people
  of Glen work underground in a complex called the Deep Mine; a single subterranean elevator
  provides access to this mine. The Deep Mine in turn connects to the Long Road, an Underdark
  highway running south under the Sea of Fallen Stars. Trade caravans travel between Glen and
  dwarven cities in the Underdark, taking about three months to complete the journey.
</p>
<p>
  The dwarves of Glen operate a special trade in dragon eggs. Glen merchants sell rare mushrooms
  collected in the Underdark for exorbitant prices and use the proceeds to buy dragon eggs, storing
  them under the village in temperature-controlled cellars. This operation is kept secret, but the
  Cult of the Dragon has heard the story. The cult’s efforts to steal the eggs have run afoul of
  Glen’s diligent citizens, who protect the Deep Mine and the entrance to the Long Road against
  subterranean threats.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="PeldansHelm">Peldan’s Helm</h4>
<p>
  North of the Barrowfield, the small village of Peldan’s Helm lies along the dangerous western edge
  of Mistledale. A stout stone wall protects the village, and the gate is never opened between
  sunset and sunrise, even for known travelers, as [monsters]Ghost;Ghosts[/monsters] from the
  Barrowfield have been known to possess folk and use them to gain entrance. Recently, goblins have
  laid siege to Peldan’s Hold twice, so bell ringers now stand ready at all times to send a call for
  help to Ashabenford—whose militia is a day’s ride away.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Scardale">Scardale</h3>
<p>
  Historically, Scardale has been one of the most influential of the dales. It benefits from clear
  geographical boundaries, a large population, and flourishing trade. But Scardale has a foul
  reputation as a home for would-be conquerors, and it has suffered many setbacks, including a
  terrible plague. Now, under a new ruler, the people of this realm are eager to reclaim Scardale’s
  status as the wealthiest, most powerful, and most important dale.
</p>
<p>
  Scardale lies within the Scar, a high-sided gorge that begins at Feather Falls, following the
  <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a> through the towns of Chandlerscross and Scarsdeep until it
  reaches <a href="#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a> and the Sea of Falling Stars. The Scar’s width
  varies between fifteen to twenty miles, and the land along the shores of the river is excellent
  for ranching and farming. Legend has it the gorge was cut by Corellon during a legendary duel with
  Gruumsh.
</p>
<p>
  The River Ashaba flows through Scardale, and countless farms, mills, and ranches line its shore.
  The current here is swift, as the river rushes from waterfall to river mouth, but the river is too
  shallow for oceangoing vessels to traverse. Merchants from outside the Dalelands travel to
  Scardale Town to barter with local traders, who then make the laborious journey upstream to sell
  goods in Chandlerscross.
</p>
<p>
  Scardale’s most infamous citizen was Lord Lashan Aumersair, who was a descendant of the legendary
  archmage Elminster and attempted to conquer the dales. An alliance of many Realms defeated Lashan,
  and for a time Scardale was ruled by a coalition of the victors of this war. Sembia, Scardale’s
  chief trading partner, even managed to assimilate Scardale for a time. Then the infamous fallen
  paladin Scyllua Darkhope seized control, armed with a will declaring her Lashan’s heir. Proving
  the apple hadn’t fallen far from the tree, Scyllua also led a conquest of the dales. More

<p>
  Among Scardale’s legacies is the Shaking Plague. This magical sickness killed two-thirds of the
  population of Scardale Town when it erupted over a century ago, and it still surfaces occasionally
  in the towns along the river.
</p>
<hr class="separator" />
<h4 class="compendium-hr h4-override with-metadata" id="ShakingPlague">Shaking Plague</h4>
<p><em>Magical Contagion</em></p>
<p>
  Magical experiments gone awry gave rise to Shaking Plague, which affects Humanoids. A creature
  suffers the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fatigue.</strong> The creature gains 1 [condition]Exhaustion[/condition] level. While the
  creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest doesn’t reduce the creature’s Exhaustion
  level.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pus Boils.</strong> While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, its skin is covered in
  pus-filled boils.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Shaking.</strong> While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, magic-dampening tremors
  afflict it. The creature has Disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws, and whenever the
  creature casts a spell with a Somatic component, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
  throw, or the spell dissipates with no effect and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to
  cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, that slot isn’t expended.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Fighting the Contagion.</em></strong> Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC
  11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its
  fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the
  creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Spreading the Contagion.</em></strong> Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a
  creature infected with Shaking Plague must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or also
  become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion
  from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Chandlerscross">Chandlerscross</h4>
<p>
  The busy town of Chandlerscross is positioned near the foot of Feather Falls. Unlike the
  cosmopolitan Scardale Town, Chandlerscross is inhabited almost entirely by farmers, ranchers, and
  artisans whose families have been here for generations. The town is patrolled by a diligent and
  well-mannered militia. The ruler of the town is the wood elf Abyssa Whitelock (Medium, Lawful Evil
  [monsters]Gladiator[/monsters]), a former adventurer; she watches outsiders closely before quickly
  and politely urging them to move along. Those who refuse are first thrown into the town jail, then
  evicted from the town.
</p>
<p>
  While Scardale Town was at its most lawless, Chandlerscross temporarily became the capital of the
  dale, but locals are happy the town has since returned to a quiet life of obscurity, unbothered by
  Sembians, the Zhentarim, and local crime guilds. Travelers seeking to go upriver from here must
  carry their boats along a laborious portage route up the edge of the Scar.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Scarsdeep">Scarsdeep</h4>
<p>
  Oceangoing vessels can’t navigate all the way upriver to Chandlerscross. The town of Scarsdeep was
  founded where most such vessels are forced to turn around. A comparatively young settlement,
  Scarsdeep draws in farmers and merchants looking to expand their market. Entrepreneurs frequently
  found new businesses to capitalize on this growth, and the main street of Scarsdeep is crowded
  with taverns, inns, gambling houses, and more, all competing for the attention and coin of
  newcomers.
</p>
<p>
  The cliffs of the Scar nearest Scarsdeep are home to a nasty group of bandits called the Deep
  Daggers. They shelter in an abandoned dwarven mine they’ve renovated, blocking off shafts that
  lead to the Underdark. Most of the gang are [monsters]Bandit Scofflaw;Bandit Scofflaws[/monsters],
  led by several [monsters]Bandit Captain;Bandit Captains[/monsters] who answer to a mysterious rock
  gnome using the alias Scarless Jon (Small, Neutral Evil [monsters]Bandit Deceiver[/monsters]). Jon

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</h3>
<p>
  Scardale Town is the capital of Scardale and was once the largest city in the Dalelands, but its
  fortunes have waxed and waned over the years. After a long period of rebuilding, Scardale Town is
  growing into a proper city once more. About five thousand people call this settlement home, but
  the dockside neighborhood is crowded with merchants, travelers, and adventurers from across
  Faerûn. Adventurers can find items worth up to 2,000 GP in Scardale Town’s many markets, and
  potentially more valuable items in the cargo of ships docked at port.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="LordKharuAumersair">Lord Kharu Aumersair</h4>
<p>
  Lord Kharu Aumersair (Medium, Lawful Evil [monsters]Noble Prodigy[/monsters]) is the ruler of
  Scardale and the tiefling son of the infamous fallen paladin Scyllua Darkhope, Scardale’s previous
  ruler. Scyllua’s claim to the throne of Scardale was based on a written document, supposedly the
  testament of Lashan Aumersair, claiming that Scyllua was his daughter. Kharu’s right to rule is
  also based on this document.
</p>
<p>
  But Scyllua had deep ties to the Zhentarim, which benefited greatly from her rise to power in
  Scardale, and many Dalefolk believe the document establishing her as Lashan’s heir was forged by
  Zhents. If the letter were ever proven to be forged, Kharu Aumersair’s right to rule Scardale
  would evaporate.
</p>
<p>
  To shore up his power in Scardale Town, Kharu has forged alliances with the town’s local criminal
  syndicates, giving them free rein dockside as long as they help him contain the Zhentarim, the Red
  Wizards, and economic aggression from Sembia. Kharu is charismatic and brings order to Scardale’s
  docks and byways; the townsfolk put up with a certain amount of political corruption if it means
  they can safely walk the streets at night.
</p>
<p>
  If Kharu can indeed bring peace to this infamously lawless city, the people seem likely to accept
  his rule, but rivals like the Zhentarim and Sembia are eager to see him fall, and they intend to
  seize power for themselves or simply allow Scardale Town to fall back into chaos.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="CrimeinScardale">Crime in Scardale</h4>
<p>
  Three criminal syndicates—the Dancers, the Shaker Gang, and the Stallions—compete in Scardale
  Town. The Dancers is a gang of well-armed [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] with a lucrative
  protection racket, fleecing merchant ships and port businesses. The gang’s leader is a halfling
  named Finchley (Small, Chaotic Evil [monsters]Tough Boss[/monsters]).
</p>
<p>
  The Shaker Gang runs gambling operations throughout the city as a cover for its extensive burglary
  operations. The human Boss Eli Sneed (Medium, Neutral Evil [monsters]Bandit Crime Lord;Bandit
  Crime Boss[/monsters]) commands the Shaker Gang from his palatial mansion overlooking the river.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the Stallions is a band of [monsters]Pirate;Pirates[/monsters] based out of the
  <em>Sea Stallion</em>, a wrecked galley outside Scar Harbor; the gang’s primary business is
  smuggling, but it also hires out for short seafaring exploits if the money is good. The gang is
  led by the wood elf Captain Walenna Eventide (Medium, Chaotic Neutral [monsters]Pirate
  Captain[/monsters]).
</p>
<p>
  These three syndicates fought turf wars years ago and nearly destroyed each other; now they eye
  each other warily but usually leave each other alone. There’s one thing Scardale Town’s three
  crime syndicates can agree on: foreign powers should never again be allowed to rule the dale. It
  is for this reason that they’ve agreed to work with Lord Aumersair, regardless of his dubious
  claims.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="NoteworthyPlaces">Noteworthy Places</h4>
<p>
  Scardale Town is a great port at the mouth of the <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a>. Scar
  Harbor is easily defensible with a narrow entrance leading to Port Ashaba, around which most of
  the town is built.
</p>
<p>
  The river is crossed by two bridges: the smaller Dawnstar Bridge in the west and the larger Anvil
  Bridge halfway through the city. The eastern half of the town is dominated by Port Ashaba. Several
  inns and taverns cater to Scardale’s diverse population. The Spouting Fish and the Fatted Calf are
  among the quietest, while the Singing Siren is infamous for its rowdy brawls. The Zhentarim uses
  the Dragon’s Tail as a base of operations.
</p>
<p>
  The oldest religious buildings in town are shrines to Tymora and Tempus that have survived the
  town’s many calamities. The orc Sigora Swordwise (Medium, Chaotic Neutral
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters]) maintains the shrine to Tempus, and the high elf Rhodantha Sneed
  (Medium, Chaotic Good [monsters]Archpriest[/monsters]), who is married to the leader of the Shaker
  gang (see above), tends the shrine to Tymora.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Four Dolphins Fountain.</em></strong> The famous Four Dolphins Fountain, which depicts
  four leaping dolphins, lies near the port. It’s surrounded by a courtyard where tourists and
  criminals gather. But the fountain’s real claim to fame is a powerful magical effect that allows
  individuals within the courtyard to meet privately without being scried on. Kharu Aumersair uses
  this property of the fountain to meet with the leaders of the town’s various criminal syndicates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Harborwatch Keep.</em></strong> Harborwatch Keep, the ancestral home of the Aumersair
  dynasty, stands on the far east end of town, overlooking the entrance to Scar Harbor and Port
  Ashaba. The central stronghold is an impressive round tower buttressed by a curtain wall facing
  the sea that protects from bombardment. Lord Aumersair wants Scardale Town to become the permanent
  host for the Dales Council, so he’s renovating the keep to make it as comfortable and attractive
  to his fellow rulers as possible. Ambassadors from Scardale’s major trading partners—including
  Cormyr, Sembia, and the other dales—keep ambassadors here. The human ambassador from Sembia is
  Dian Selkirk (Medium, Neutral [monsters]Spy Master[/monsters]); she’s busy creating a network of
  informers in town.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Thayan Enclave.</em></strong> The Red Wizards of Thay maintain a modest walled enclave
  in Scardale Town. The wizard in charge is a human named Jenla Hal (Medium, Lawful Evil
  [monsters]Archmage[/monsters]), and she is assisted by [monsters]Mage;Mages[/monsters] and a
  garrison of [monsters]Warrior Veteran;Warrior Veterans[/monsters] and
  <strong>[monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters].</strong> As usual with such enclaves, the land within
  is considered Thayan territory, but Jenla keeps a low profile and abides by the lord’s laws in an
  attempt to win him over and become his chief adviser. The Red Wizards trade in Common and Uncommon
  magic items. Jenla might acquire a Rare magic item for a character willing to do her a favor.

<p>
  In Shadowdale, proud and stubborn families work their farms, mind their own business, and share
  mugs of ale with legendary adventurers. Meanwhile, the Zhentarim, evil drow from the Underdark,
  and other malevolent forces gather in the eaves of the forest and in subterranean tunnels,
  threatening the peace that generations of Dalefolk have purchased with blood and tears. More than
  one invasion or would-be tyrant has been stopped at Shadowdale.
</p>
<p>
  The largest settlement in Shadowdale is Shadowdale Town (<a href="#ShadowdaleTown">see below</a>),
  and farmsteads, cottages, and cabins can be found throughout the forest. When it comes to claiming
  land in Shadowdale, there’s an old truism: build close enough to see your neighbor’s chimney but
  far enough away that you can’t hear your neighbors quarrel.
</p>
<p>
  Shadowdale has historically chosen its rulers by popular acclaim, selecting adventurers who’ve
  done the people of Shadowdale a great service or otherwise proven their valor and selflessness.
  The current ruler, Khara Sulwood, is the great-granddaughter of the former lord of Shadowdale,
  Doust Sulwood, but her true claim to the loyalty of her subjects is that she helped repel an
  assault on the town decades ago. Lady Sulwood is assisted by a loyal bodyguard named Tharinel.
  More information on Lady Sulwood and Tharinel can be found in “Shadowdale Town” below.
</p>
<p>
  The two primary travel routes through Shadowdale are the Northride and the
  <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a>. The Northride is a well-maintained but dangerous road
  leading north from the rebuilt town of Tilverton through winding hills that provide havens for
  robbers and cutthroats; this region is called the Shadow Gap and marks the border of Shadowdale.
  Merchants using the Northride continue through the forest to the town of Voonlar, Shadowdale’s
  longtime rival. Militia patrol the Northride, but guarding the road has become a rite of passage
  for novice adventuring parties.
</p>
<p>
  The River Ashaba runs south from <a href="#Daggerdale">Daggerdale</a> through Shadowdale Town and
  into the forest of <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>. The river is wide and shallow, and minor
  flooding is common every spring. Many orc families live along the river’s edge and offer ferry
  services for travelers, for the only nearby bridge across the river is in Shadowdale Town. The
  forests of Shadowdale are home to fey, including goblins of the Broken Bones clan and an extended
  family of centaurs called the Sylvan Guardians. These fey make travel through the forest
  dangerous.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="CastleKrag">Castle Krag</h4>
<p>
  Thousands of years ago, drow built the first Castle Krag, including a large central tower and
  adjoining wall. Over time, however, the fortress has been home to many groups who have wished ill
  on the people of Shadowdale, including the Zhentarim, followers of Bane, and simple bandits. The
  castle has burned to the ground more than once, but as new inhabitants moved in, they have tried
  to clear, rebuild, renovate, and expand the old structure. Now, it is a sprawling half-buried
  labyrinth, home to undead, forest creatures, and outlaws.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="Freedale">Freedale</h4>
<p>
  Freedale was founded two centuries ago on the banks of the River Ashaba. The goal of the town’s
  founders was to create a new, independent dale. Like so many other would-be dales, however,
  Freedale briefly flourished, struggled, and eventually collapsed. Now, abandoned buildings fill
  the center of town, and the few families who remain live in log cabins on the outskirts.
</p>
<p>
  The Evening Star Inn, an establishment that mostly caters to orc fishers, continues to be operated
  by the Starlight family. Recently several youths in the village—would-be adventurers—have claimed
</p>
<p>
  the unstable ruins of the Red Dragon Tavern their headquarters. They meet there in their free time
  to plan ambitious explorations. Freedale was once home to a reclusive wizard who resided in a
  tower on the edge of town. This tower still stands but is long-abandoned and avoided by the
  locals.
</p>
<p>See “Dalelands Adventures” later in this chapter for more on Freedale.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ShallainFreehold">Shallain Freehold</h4>
<p>
  Generations ago, the Shallain family of halflings built a walled homestead on the northwest border
  of Shadowdale. The current matriarch of the halfling family, Sunflower Shallain (Small, Neutral
  Good [monsters]Druid[/monsters]), welcomes travelers, hoping to enlist them to deter goblin
  raiders, gnolls, and other dangerous creatures that threaten the homestead.
</p>
<p>
  The freehold sits atop a low hill and encompasses a dozen wooden buildings surrounded by a wall of
  sharpened logs. The Shallain family numbers about thirty. They keep a herd of goats that graze by
  day and shelter within the freehold walls at night.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SpiderhauntWood">Spiderhaunt Wood</h4>
<p>
  The Spiderhaunt Wood along the Northride is a den for countless spiders and related creatures,
  including [monsters]Giant Spider;Giant Spiders[/monsters], [monsters]Giant Wolf Spider;Giant Wolf
  Spiders[/monsters], [monsters]Phase Spider;Phase Spiders[/monsters], and
  [monsters]Ettercap;Ettercaps[/monsters]. Alchemists, assassins, and wizards come to Spiderhaunt
  Wood to collect arachnid venom and other rare ingredients. A single trail through the forest, the
  Arachnid Pathway, leads west from Stormpemhauder, a village primarily consisting of forest gnomes,
  to Lake Melishar, one of the few places in the woods spiders don’t go. The pathway ends at the
  tower of Gothyl, a long-dead wizard who tried and failed to become a lich. Some believe Gothyl’s
  tower is the resting place of the <em>Sword of the Dales</em>, a legendary [magicitems]Longsword,
  \+3;+3 Longsword[/magicitems] with additional unknown properties; the sword was once used in an
  effort to unite the dales under a single ruler.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TombofDamara">Tomb of Damara</h4>
<p>
  South of Shadowdale Town stands an abandoned castle that was once home to the benevolent wizard
  Damara. Damara possessed a potent orb reputed to have various magical properties (see
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/magic-items/">chapter 8</a> for the [magicitems]Orb of
  Damara[/magicitems] ). But he perished at the hands of an ogre warlord named Bonegnasher, who
  brought an army of gnolls and hobgoblins into the castle to search for the orb.
</p>
<p>
  The orb was never found. Bonegnasher is long dead, and now he—along with the unliving corpses of
  his minions—haunts the castle. Moreover, in his tireless search for the orb, Bonegnasher ordered
  extensive tunnels dug under the castle, tunnels that might have broken into the Underdark.
</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ShadowdaleTown">Shadowdale Town</h3>
<p>
  Located where the North Ride crosses the <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a> at a key bridge,
  Shadowdale Town is a sleepy community of about 1,500 people in the shadow of the Old Skull, a hill
  of pale, volcanic rock covered in lichen and grass. Shepherds graze their herds on the hill’s
  grassy slopes, and children play atop the hill’s summit. Tunnels beneath the hill extend to the
  Underdark, and drow invaders have used the Old Skull as an invasion route multiple times.
</p>
<p>
  Lady Khara Sulwood (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Knight[/monsters]) is the human ruler of the
  town and has been in power for a generation. She wears the <em>Pendant of Ashaba</em>, an Artifact
  that represents her authority and sustains powerful wards protecting the town. Tharinel (Medium,
  Neutral Good [monsters]Guard Captain[/monsters]) is Lady Sulwood’s most trusted ally and
  bodyguard, having been at her side most of her life.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="SageofShadowdale">Sage of Shadowdale</h4>
<p>
  Shadowdale Town has been home to some of the greatest heroes of Faerûn, most notably Elminster and
  Storm Silverhand.
</p>
<p>
  A great archmage and former Chosen of Mystra, Elminster lived in a former windmill on the southern
  edge of the Old Skull. The humble, three-story structure, covered in vines and magically restored
  after being nearly destroyed by assassins serving Shar, has been locked up and abandoned for a
  decade now. Elminster hasn’t been seen in all that time.
</p>
<p>
  An old sign still stands along a path leading to the door, reading “No trespassing. Violators
  should notify next of kin. Have a pleasant day.” The tower’s exterior is crowded with lean-tos and
  other patchwork constructions that once held Elminster’s vast collection of books and magical
  trinkets. All these storage facilities are now empty, however.
</p>
<p>
  Elminster protected Shadowdale—and indeed all of Faerûn—for centuries. It would be foolish to
  assume he’s dead, and equally foolish to trespass in his home, so everyone gives the tower a wide
  berth while expecting the old wizard to show up one day as if no time had passed. A few times a
  year, a figure is spotted moving around inside the tower, but they’re always gone by morning.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="NoteworthyPlaces2">Noteworthy Places</h4>
<p>
  Shadowdale Town includes temples to Tymora and Lathander; a general store; stables; a central
  well;
</p>
<p>
  and many workshops maintained by the town’s blacksmiths, carpenters, and other crafters. A mill
  lies south along the river, while farms line the north shore.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Druid’s Grove.</em></strong> North of town, well within the forest, stands a circle of
  ancient menhirs. Long ago, this circle was used by a group of druids, but as Shadowdale Town grew,
  the druids retreated deeper into the forest of <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>, and this
  grove was abandoned.
</p>
<p>
  Many fey live in and around this circle, and the border with the Feywild is thin here. Individuals
  with the proper knowledge can use this stone circle to travel anywhere in Faerûn or the Feywild.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>House of the Lady.</em></strong> The House of the Lady is a temple to Tymora on the
  far west end of town that doubles as a gambling hall and tavern. The domed temple proper is
  protected by a square stone wall. The wall also encloses outbuildings for the temple staff and
  occasional guests. The temple is overseen by the halfling priest Marigold Gambol (Small, Chaotic
  Good [monsters]Priest[/monsters]), a lifelong resident of Shadowdale. Marigold considers herself
  Shadowdale’s chief protector now that Elminster is gone. She works tirelessly in the shadows to
  collect rumors and keep an eye on strangers in town. In public, she appears carefree, but she is
  quick to pull influential residents aside to remind them of the threat posed by drow cultists or
  the Zhentarim.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Morningdawn Hall.</em></strong> Shadowdale’s first temple to Lathander, Morningdawn
  Hall, was an ostentatious landmark: a magically constructed edifice in the shape of a phoenix with
  its wings outstretched. But that temple was destroyed long ago. A replacement was funded by
  adventurers eager for curative magic after repeated expeditions to the Underdark, and it better
  suits the insular and unobtrusive folk of Shadowdale. It boasts a tall spire rising from an
  eastward-facing prayer hall. Adjoining buildings house clergy and lay assistants. The new temple
  retains the name of the original.
</p>
<p>
  The high elf priest of Lathander is Adanar the Open-Handed (Medium, Neutral Good
  [monsters]Priest[/monsters]), a former adventurer who lives in the spire. Although he’s known for
  his commanding and charismatic presence, Adanar finds joy in the quiet personal acts of his faith,
  tending to the people of Shadowdale and providing them wise counsel. Adanar’s magic is modest, but
  he does have a [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of [spells]Raise Dead[/spells].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Old Skull Inn.</em></strong> The Old Skull Inn is one of the most famous meeting spots
  for adventurers in Faerûn. Its three stories include a large ground floor taproom and almost
  thirty sleeping rooms, each with a colorful name like “Numpkin’s Rest,” “The Onyx,” or “The
  Huntsman’s Room.” Cellars connect to catacombs beneath Old Skull hill and provide access to the
  Underdark.
</p>
<p>
  The current proprietor, the halfling Mungo Silvermane (Small, Neutral Good
  [monsters]Commoner[/monsters]), is still earning the trust of the regulars, but he has a practical
  head on his shoulders and a knack for puns. He’s put this latter talent into practice with weekly
  pun contests; the winner of each event gets their tab cleared.
</p>
<p>
  Any trouble in the inn is rapidly put down by well-armed patrons. A few Common magic items are
  usually available in the inn, offered for sale by adventurers eager to sell loot.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tower of Ashaba.</em></strong> The Tower of Ashaba is a stone fortress raised by
  ancient and evil powers long ago. An off-balance tower rises five stories from a tall, square,
  stone stronghold; this tower’s bizarre shape has earned it the name “the Twisted Tower.” The tower
  was a stronghold for drow cultists until the water wizard Ashaba drove them out four hundred years
  ago and became the first lord of Shadowdale. The rulers of Shadowdale have dwelled here ever
  since, fighting off assaults by Zhentarim, would-be tyrants, and others.
</p>
<p>
  Lady Sulwood is master of the tower now and maintains a garrison of a hundred
  [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] under Tharinel’s command. The tower’s three subterranean levels
  include entrances to the Underdark, only some of which have collapsed or been sealed off.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Tasseldale">Tasseldale</h3>
<p>
  Tasseldale is a land of wide-open spaces. The twelve villages, or tassels, of Tasseldale are
  connected by the Tasselway, a road that cuts through rolling, mist-covered grassland crisscrossed
  with streams flowing north into the <a href="#RiverAshaba">River Ashaba</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The most notable tassels include Archtassel, Arrowmark, Glaun, Halfcrag, Moontassel, Tasselheart,
  and Tegal’s Mark. The others are so small as to be mere hamlets, with no more than a few dozen
  buildings. The people of Tasseldale are proud farmers, ranchers, and crafters. Tasseldale is
  synonymous with the forging of excellent swords; the capital of Tegal’s Mark is the heart of this
  tradition.
</p>
<p>
  The ruler of Tasseldale is Grand Marshair Rora Rudiland (Medium, Lawful Good [monsters]Warrior
  Commander[/monsters]), a devotee of Tyr and graduate of the Abbey of the Just Hammer (see below).
  She is advised by the Elder Council, consisting of one representative from each of the twelve
  tassels. An excellent swordfighter, Rora inspects the work of Tasseldale’s swordsmiths in an
  annual fair held in the capital of Tegal’s Mark.
</p>
<p>
  The dale is defended by the Marshairs, a company of sixty mounted warriors who patrol the dale and
  keep the peace; in time of war, however, Tasseldale can raise a large militia of veteran
  swordfighters, many of whom carry high-quality swords passed down as family heirlooms.
</p>
<p>
  Among the other dales, Tasseldale has a long rivalry with neighboring
  <a href="#Archendale">Archendale</a>. The roots of this dispute stretch back into murky history,
  but the heart of it seems to lie with a murdered forester in the
  <a href="#ArchWood">Arch Wood</a>, on the border between the two dales. This feud erupts into
  violence every generation, as hotheaded youths grow weary of the cautionary tales told them by
  elders and seek out their rivals under cover of the trees.
</p>
<p>
  Tasseldale’s long relationship with its wealthy, aggressive neighbor Sembia has shaped this realm
  and its people. Other folk of the Dalelands dismiss the people of Tasseldale as weak-willed
  compromisers who give in to Sembia’s every demand in order to avoid being conquered. But those who
  dwell in Tasseldale know that Sembia can’t be countered through force; diplomacy and strength of
  character will always win the day. This was proven true when Sembia invaded decades ago. When the
  effort stalled, Sembia sent in enough mercenaries to finish the job, but the cost in blood and
  treasure proved too high. About fifteen years ago, Sembia retreated from Tasseldale, returning the
  realm to independent rule.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AbbeyoftheJustHammer">Abbey of the Just Hammer</h4>
<p>
  The Abbey of the Just Hammer is dedicated to Tyr and, along with the Monastery of the Sun Soul, is
  responsible for the taming of the Dun Hills. The abbey was the site of a legendary battle when
  Deren Eriach, Lord High Justicar of the abbey, slew the ancient green dragon Sirvinhandra with a
  [magicitems]Holy Avenger Greataxe;Holy Avenger (Greataxe)[/magicitems] dubbed the Axe of Heavenly
  Fire. The axe went on to be wielded by a succession of heroes but has been returned to the abbey
  and is now displayed above the foremost altar to Tyr. Sirvinhandra’s lair was never found, though
  green dragons have since been sighted in the region.
</p>
<p>
  The abbey provides legal education to citizens of Tasseldale, making it one of the few places for
  advanced education anywhere in the Dalelands. Lawyers and judges who complete their training at
  the abbey are offered lucrative employment throughout the Heartlands, but many help the poor and
  unfortunate instead.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="GlaunBog">Glaun Bog</h4>
<p>
  The Glaun Bog is a fetid swamp west of the Dun Hills, home to
  [monsters]Peryton;Perytons[/monsters], [monsters]Troll;Trolls[/monsters],
  [monsters]Will-o’-Wisp;Will-o’-Wisps[/monsters], [monsters]Wyvern;Wyverns[/monsters], and
  countless goblins. Pits of quicksand make travel perilous, and at the center of the bog lie
  ancient barrows inhabited by <strong>[monsters]Wight;Wights[/monsters].</strong> But the bog is
  rich in iron deposits, and swordsmiths of Tasseldale covet this iron for their work.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, locals from the village of Glaun know the bog well. They have learned how to avoid
  the worst of the bog’s dangers, and they venture in to gather iron for smelting and peat for
  burning. Adventurers looking to explore the bog would be wise to hire one of these locals as a
  guide.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MonasteryoftheSunSoul">Monastery of the Sun Soul</h4>
<p>
  Centuries ago, monks following a path known as the Way of the Sun Soul selected a ruined fortress
  in the Dun Hills as their new home. They rebuilt the Monastery of the Sun Soul despite frequent
  goblin raids, and ever since, the monks have cooperated with the Abbey of the Just Hammer to keep
  Tasseldale safe.
</p>
<p>
  The monks accept every prospective student who comes to their door, but the grueling training
  regimen repels many students, and others tire of the monastic life. The monks’ philosophy
  emphasizes intense spiritual discipline that focuses the soul into a fiery source of blazing
  power. Students unusually attached to wealth and a desire for money recieve the most rigorous
  training and scrutiny.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="TegalsMark">Tegal’s Mark</h4>
<p>
  The capital of Tasseldale is Tegal’s Mark, a picturesque village situated between two forested
  hills and surrounded by gardens that include a shrine to Chauntea. An old elven watchtower known
  as the Sharburg was long ago repurposed and now functions as the home to Grand Marshair Rora
  Rudiland. Rora hosts the Tassel Elders at the Sharburg, and the fortress also houses barracks for
  her Marshairs and a dismal dungeon for prisoners.
</p>
<p>
  Tegal’s Mark is where the dale’s legacy for sword smithing got its start, as the village was
  founded by the swordsmith Tegal centuries ago. Adventurers seeking excellent swords travel here
  from across Faerûn. But the smiths of Tasseldale are infamously picky about whom they deal with,
  turning away buyers they judge beneath their efforts while making others wait for long periods at
  one of the village’s many taverns, including the Markhouse, the Royal Flagon, and the Sword and
  Sash, the latter of which boasts the village’s only theatrical stage.
</p>
<p>
  The village includes dozens of vacation homes owned by wealthy Sembian families. These opulent
  manors are empty most of the year, and locals have come to resent them. Outlaws occasionally take
  refuge in these houses, and they’re often burgled, all of which has led their Sembian owners to
  protect them with layers of security including locks, deadly traps, mechanical guardians, and
  magical wards. Several Sembian merchant companies keep warehouses and administrative offices here,
  making Tassel’s Mark an even more lucrative target for thieves.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="DalelandsStories">Dalelands Stories</h2>
<p>
  The Dalelands is a place for adventure in the oldest D&D tradition, and at its heart lies the
  forested megadungeon of <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="ClassicHeroicFantasy">Classic Heroic Fantasy</h3>
<p>
  A wizard’s abandoned tower rises on the edge of town. An insidious cult hides its ghastly rituals
  in a warren of caves. Drow cultists raid from the Underdark. Hostile and benevolent fey fill the
  nearby forest, within which a dragon makes its lair. These are elements of classic heroic fantasy
  adventure, and they perfectly describe life in the Dalelands. This makes the Dalelands
  particularly appropriate for DMs and players who enjoy D&D’s most well-established tropes.
</p>
<p>
  This aspect of the Dalelands also makes it a good place to set adventures originally written for
  other settings. Locations such as the Keep on the Borderlands and nearby Caves of Chaos, both
  detailed in
  <a href="/sources/dnd/hotb"
    >D&D Starter Set: Heroes of the Borderlands, fit well here, as do the Sunless Citadel and Forge
    of Fury, both detailed in the adventure anthology </a
  ><a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/tftyp">Tales from the Yawning Portal</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AHomeWorthDefending">A Home Worth Defending</h3>
<p>
  A campaign in the Dalelands could involve the characters building a home and legacy while
  defending themselves from dangerous forest creatures, Zhentarim agents, and mysterious menaces
  from the Underdark. In a campaign of this sort, the characters make up a family and friends who
  inhabit a Dalelands homestead. The head of the family might be a retired adventurer, or there
  might be former adventurers in the family’s ancestry. Other characters have prominent roles around
  the homestead as, for example, the blacksmith, cook, or herder. The challenges of running the
  homestead can mix with the combat and exploration present in any D&D campaign.
</p>
<p>
  Adventure can also come to the homestead. Goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear bandits raid from the
  eaves of the forest. <a href="#MoanderGodofRot">Moander’s</a> corruption of
  <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a> creates blights and bizarre monsters that threaten everyone
  in the dale. Zhentarim agents try to buy property that stands atop buried caches of treasure, and
  when the owners refuse to sell, the Zhents respond with threats and violence. As the homestead
  grows, it draws ever more attention from enemies and jealous rivals.
</p>
<p>
  And the characters also travel, going to <a href="#ShadowdaleTown">Shadowdale Town</a> or
  <a href="#ScardaleTown">Scardale Town</a> to sell their wares, resupply, and get the latest
  gossip. They go on adventures when, for example, a member of the family falls victim to a magical
  contagion and the only cure lies buried in Myth Drannor.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, when danger threatens families throughout the dale, the characters rise to leadership
  roles, uniting the dale together and marshaling a common defense. Eventually, the characters join
  the local council, adopt titles, or are elected leaders of the dale.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="AdventuresinMythDrannor">Adventures in Myth Drannor</h3>
<p>
  The vast, ruined city of <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a> provides endless adventure in a
  fantastic, magical locale. While you can make exploring Myth Drannor the focus for a campaign, you
  might begin with brief expeditions into the city. The party might need to recover a magical
  heirloom lost within Myth Drannor or stop the Cult of the Dragon from exploiting an ancient elven
  magical experiment.
</p>
<p>
  In a campaign focused on Myth Drannor, the city is a sandbox the characters explore at their own
  pace. Give them opportunities to research the city and learn where to investigate next. When
  they’re low level, the characters probe the outskirts of the city, where woodland beasts and fey
  are common. As the characters gain experience, they can enter Myth Drannor proper, where they
  encounter ancient elven mysteries, roving fiends, and rival treasure hunters. Eventually, the
  characters explore the city center and the wreckage of Thultanthar, battling
  <a href="/sources/dnd/fraif/bestiary#Phaerimm">phaerimm</a> and Netherese creatures altered by
  long exposure to the Shadowfell.
</p>
<p>
  In between their excursions into Myth Drannor, the characters can undertake adventures in other
  parts of the Dalelands.
</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr" id="DalelandsConflicts">Dalelands Conflicts</h2>
<p>
  Each dale in the Dalelands has its own local problems, ranging from goblin bandits to a hungry
  dragon. But the threat of Moander, god of rot and corruption, looms over the Dalelands as a whole.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="HeroesoftheDalelands">Heroes of the Dalelands</h3>
<p>
  Conflict in a campaign focused on exploring the Dalelands doesn’t come from one villain in
  particular. Instead, the adventurers pit themselves against disparate threats all over the
  Dalelands. As the party goes from one dale to another, they meet and befriend important NPCs,
  solve problems, and rise in notoriety and power. An important element of this is the party’s role
  restoring the village of <a href="#Freedale">Freedale</a>; success in this venture encourages
  rulers throughout the Dalelands to treat the characters as equals.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="HeroicGoals">Heroic Goals</h4>
<p>
  This campaign is driven by the goals of the characters—to explore the Dalelands, help Dalefolk,
  and bring peace and prosperity to the dales—not the goals of a single insidious villain.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="ADalelandsArc">A Dalelands Arc</h4>
<p>The adventurers’ rise to fame in the Dalelands might follow this broad outline.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 1–4.</em></strong> The characters come together in the Old Skull Inn, where
  they’re hired to recover a book from a lost library. Use “<a
    href="/sources/dnd/fraif/the-lost-library-of-lethchauntos/"
    >The Lost Library of Lethchauntos</a
  >” in chapter 7. Their success on this quest brings them to the attention of Lady Sulwood, who
  sends them on the adventure “<a href="#TheTombofDamara">The Tomb of Damara</a>” in this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 5–10.</em></strong> Now proven heroes, the party is asked to return prosperity
  and hope to Freedale. You can use “<a href="#RestoringFreedale">Restoring Freedale</a>” in this
  chapter. The characters become the rulers of Freedale, with one character sitting on the Dales
  Council. In further adventures, the characters travel to each dale, solving problems and earning
  goodwill. You can use “<a href="#TheTempleofTransmutation">The Temple of Transmutation</a>” in
  this chapter as part of this story. The party might even eventually try to recover the legendary
  <em>Sword of the Dales</em> and unite the Dalelands!
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="MoanderGodofRot">Moander, God of Rot</h3>
<p>
  Moander is the god of corruption and rot, and heroes in the Dalelands have battled him for
  centuries. The hero Alias left Moander’s rotting corpse on a hill in
  <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a>. But a god isn’t so easily killed.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="MoandersGoals">Moander’s Goals</h4>
<p>
  Moander’s ultimate goal is nothing less than the corruption of Toril itself. To attain this goal,
  Moander corrupts the forest of Cormanthor and seeks to consume the magic of
  <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="AMoanderArc">A Moander Arc</h4>
<p>The conflict between adventurers and Moander might follow this broad outline.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 1–4.</em></strong> Adventurers encounter Moander’s corruption when they enter
  Cormanthor, where [monsters]Twig Blight;Twig Blights[/monsters], [monsters]Needle Blight;Needle
  Blights[/monsters], and [monsters]Vine Blight;Vine Blights[/monsters] have made roads and trails
  dangerous. The party can follow the trail back to a fetid pit of rotting vegetation, home to a
  [monsters]Gibbering Mouther[/monsters].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 5–10.</em></strong> The party is tasked with investigating the Citadel of
  Fungi. [monsters]Shambling Mound;Shambling Mounds[/monsters] and [monsters]Tree Blight;Tree
  Blights[/monsters] prey on anything that comes near. An [monsters]Aberrant Cultist[/monsters]
  rules the citadel, protected by a [monsters]Violet Fungus Necrohulk[/monsters].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 11–16.</em></strong> The characters descend into
  <a href="#RottingGorge">Rotting Gorge</a>, a vast underground maze of slimy mushroom-covered
  caverns, home to [monsters]Spore of Moander;Spores of Moander[/monsters], a [monsters]Gulthias
  Blight[/monsters], and an [monsters]Adult Green Dragon[/monsters]. A [monsters]Death
  Tyrant[/monsters], reanimated by Moander’s evil magic, hates its own existence. With its dying
  breath, it warns the characters that Moander seeks to return in a form so hungry and destructive
  no one can stand against it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Levels 17–20.</em></strong> Moander manifests as a [monsters]Blob of
  Annihilation[/monsters] to enter Myth Drannor and feed on the ancient magic of the broken city,
  becoming even more powerful.

<p>
  Characters gain renown with a dale when they defend it from danger, explore adventure sites there,

<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="DalelandsBastions">Dalelands Bastions</h3>
<p>
  The adventure “<a href="#RestoringFreedale">Restoring Freedale</a>” in this chapter establishes
  the characters as the leaders of Freedale, a village that was once the heart of its own small
  dale—and that might rise to that status again. Freedale becomes the party’s Bastion, with the
  village’s buildings serving as the Bastion’s facilities. As the characters’ Bastion grows larger,
  they reclaim and rebuild more of the village.
</p>
<p>
  If the characters can befriend Freedale’s remaining inhabitants, the village’s citizens will
  support the characters in their effort to bring peace and prosperity to Freedale once again.
</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr" id="BastionCharacters">Bastion Characters</h4>
<p>
  This section describes unique individuals in Free-dale who might assist the characters as
  hirelings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>New Knights of Myth Drannor.</em></strong> Teens who call themselves the New Knights
  of Myth Drannor have made the ruined Red Dragon Tavern their clubhouse. At first, they’re
  skeptical of anyone who claims to be an adventurer, but once they see the characters in action,
  they become the party’s biggest fans. They graciously make the characters honorary New Knights of
  Myth Drannor and welcome them into the clubhouse; they also try to tag along on any adventures and
  pester the characters to teach them adventuring skills. The teens could serve as hirelings or even
  Bastion Defenders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Orebreaker the Smith.</em></strong> The oldest person in
  <a href="#Freedale">Freedale</a> is an ancient dwarf named Orebreaker. Although he’s famous as one
  of the greatest blacksmiths in the Dalelands, most people assume he died long ago. Orebreaker
  misses the hustle and bustle of Freedale’s glory days, and if a character constructs a Smithy in
  their Bastion, Orebreaker offers his services.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Starlight Family.</em></strong> The Starlight family runs the Evening Star Inn and
  includes Patric and Emma Starlight and their children Ban, Nissa, and Woolsey. The lack of trade
  and travel in Freedale has left the family in dire straits. If the party completes “Restoring
  Freedale” and makes the village safe for travelers again, Patric and Emma volunteer to assist the
  party as hirelings. The Starlights would serve best in a facility such as a Garden or Storehouse.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Taran Goldenstar.</em></strong> Taran Goldenstar is a self-styled “elflord” skilled in
  swordplay and arcane magic. He has dwelled in Freedale for two centuries and knows every inch of
  the surrounding forest. The characters win Taran’s friendship if they destroy the [magicitems]Orb
  of Damara[/magicitems] after completing the adventure “<a href="#TheTombofDamara"
    >The Tomb of Damara</a

  [monsters]Hobgoblin Captain[/monsters] and two [monsters]Hobgoblin Warrior;Hobgoblin
  Warriors[/monsters] are interrogating the family. The hobgoblins are Hostile to anyone other than
  Bonegnasher who interrupts their work. The youngest Silverstar, Sara, is hiding the key to
  Damara’s tomb. Once rescued, Sara gratefully gives the key to her rescuers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Garden.</em></strong> An Indifferent [monsters]Giant Frog[/monsters] lives here.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Storeroom.</em></strong> Six [monsters]Giant Rat;Giant Rats[/monsters] lurk among the
  splintered crates and ambush anyone who approaches. As a Study action, a creature can make a DC 10
  Intelligence ([skill]Investigation[/skill]) check to look for useful supplies, finding a
  [magicitems]Potion of Healing[/magicitems] and five days’ worth of Rations on a successful check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Bonegnasher’s Den.</em></strong> Bonegnasher (use the [monsters]Specter[/monsters]
  stat block, but Bonegnasher is Large) takes a break from interrogating the Silverstars here with
  his two pet <strong>[monsters]Wolf;Wolves[/monsters].</strong> He is Hostile toward any unfamiliar
  creature that enters his room.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Vault.</em></strong> The vault contains 200 GP.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Armory.</em></strong> A [monsters]Carrion Crawler[/monsters] lurks on the ceiling.
  Inside the armory is a [magicitems]Longsword, \+1;+1 Longsword[/magicitems] and [magicitems]+1
  Shield[/magicitems].
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Mine.</em></strong> A [monsters]Gelatinous Cube[/monsters] roams the cavern.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Damara’s Tomb.</em></strong> The magic door to this hidden chamber can be opened only
  with the key kept by Sara Silverstar. Damara is now a [monsters]Mummy[/monsters] protected by two
  <strong>[monsters]Shadow;Shadows[/monsters].</strong> In addition to the [magicitems]Orb of
  Damara[/magicitems], the tomb contains a [magicitems]Spell Scroll[/magicitems] of
  [spells]Fireball[/spells], and 500 GP.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> Lady Sulwood pays the characters as promised on the defeat
  of Bonegnasher. She says the party can keep any treasure they found while exploring the tomb; if
  the characters have the <em>Orb of Damara</em>, she recoils at its presence, citing its ominous
  history and suggesting that the characters find a way to destroy the relic.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> The characters are asked to reinvigorate the faded settlement of
  Freedale, but they’ll have to defend it from enemies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> The Dales Council summons the characters and asks them to become the new
  leaders of the settlement. They can turn the settlement into their Bastion (see “<a
    href="#DalelandsBastions"
    >Dalelands Bastions</a
  >”).
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Encounters2">Encounters</h3>
<p>
  As the characters settle into Freedale, they must build relationships with the locals and clear
  out old buildings that house mysterious threats. Use the map of Freedale below. The characters can
  explore these locations in any order, but the Zhentarim Foes encounter concludes the adventure.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Harrow House.</em></strong> Harrow House, an old mansion far outside the village is
  haunted by Gunter Weiss, a wizard who died and returned as a
  <strong>[monsters]Vampire Nightbringer[/monsters].</strong> Use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#SpookyHouse">Spooky House map</a> in the
  <a class="sourcebook" href="/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> for Harrow House. Gunter’s
  various Undead minions—1d4 [monsters]Flameskull;Flameskulls[/monsters] and 2d6
  [monsters]Shadow;Shadows[/monsters]—patrol the house.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Wizard’s Tower.</em></strong> Freedale was once home to a wizard named Morganth the
  Mysterious. His tower stands on the east side of the village; use the
  <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/maps#WizardsTower">Wizard’s Tower map</a> in appendix B of the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide.</em> The tower is trapped with the fire-casting statue trap described
  in <a href="/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#FireCastingStatue">chapter 3</a> of the
  <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. Morganth’s [monsters]Shield Guardian[/monsters] still patrols the
  tower; the controlling amulet is on Morganth’s corpse in the tower’s dungeon, where a
  [monsters]Ghast Gravecaller[/monsters] now hides, along with three
  <strong>[monsters]Ghoul;Ghouls[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Temple of Lathander.</em></strong> The Cult of the Dragon secretly performs ghoulish
  rites by night in this abandoned temple. If the four <strong>Cultist Acolytes</strong> and their
  [monsters]Death Cultist[/monsters] leader can be routed, the characters could reopen the temple
  and earn the goodwill of Freehold’s citizens.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Zhentarim Foes.</em></strong> As soon as the characters arrive, Zhentarim agents
  discourage them from staying and threaten violence. Eventually, the Zhents make good on that
  threat, attacking Freedale when the Bastion is near completion.
</p>
<p>
  Stage this assault in multiple waves, and describe additional hostile forces fighting any Bastion
  Defenders the party might have. First, the characters must face a [monsters]Tough Boss[/monsters]
  who leads a force of two [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] and four
  <strong>[monsters]Dire Wolf;Dire Wolves[/monsters].</strong> Then, the Zhents send a shock force
  of four [monsters]Bearded Devil;Bearded Devils[/monsters] against the characters. If the devils
  are defeated, the Zhentarim leader ([monsters]Assassin[/monsters]) and five
  [monsters]Tough;Toughs[/monsters] fight the party.

<p>
  <strong>Situation.</strong> Letha Salen, a Shadovar survivor of the crash of Thultanthar, has
  entered the Temple of Transmutation, an ancient magical research institute in
  <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>. Using a transmutation chamber in the temple, she’s
  transforming people and animals into monsters under her command.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hook.</strong> Monster attacks on the edge of
  <a href="#Cormanthor">Cormanthor</a> suddenly increase. Foresters report the creatures are coming
  from a large ruin just inside the walls of Myth Drannor. The leader of the local dale, or perhaps
  the Dales Council, asks the characters to find out what’s going on and stop the monster attacks.
</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr" id="Encounters3">Encounters</h3>
<p>
  The party travels to Myth Drannor. Once the characters reach the site, use the map on the facing
  page for the Temple of Transmutation. Other levels of the temple are blocked by rubble.
</p>
<p>
  In their exploration, the characters meet Humanoids and Beasts that have been shape-shifted into
  various creatures. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([skill]Nature[/skill]) or
  Wisdom ([skill]Insight[/skill]) check recognizes a shape-shifted creature as a former Humanoid or
  Beast, respectively. When any of these transformed creatures die, the shape-shifting effect ends,
  and they return to their true forms. If transformed back to their original shapes while still
  alive, Letha’s minions are [monsters]Guard;Guards[/monsters] and Letha is a
  <strong>[monsters]Mage[/monsters].</strong>
</p>
<p>This adventure includes the following encounters.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>1: Baxton Cottage.</em></strong> A rustic cottage is under attack by a
  [monsters]Chuul[/monsters], an [monsters]Ettin[/monsters], a [monsters]Flameskull[/monsters], and
  a [monsters]Helmed Horror[/monsters], minions of Letha Salen who have been shape-shifted. A
  halfling named Beauregard Baxton is trapped inside with his four family members (Small, Neutral
  Good [monsters]Commoner;Commoners[/monsters]). When one of the creatures is defeated, the rest
  flee, returning to area 9 to tell Letha about the party. Once rescued, Beauregard welcomes the
  party into his home. He has lived peacefully in the shadow of the temple for decades, but recently
  strange monsters have emerged from it and kidnapped his brother Brandon. The party can use his
  home as a place to rest as they investigate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>2: Crossroads.</em></strong> A goat shape-shifted into a [monsters]Tyrannosaurus
  Rex[/monsters] grazes peacefully. If threatened, it flees.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>3: Lookout.</em></strong> Two minions of Letha Salen, now transformed into a
  [monsters]Troll[/monsters] and an [monsters]Umber Hulk[/monsters], keep watch from this hilltop
  building, looking for potential victims to be transformed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>4: Crash Wreckage.</em></strong> Pieces of Thultanthar fell on the temple here,
  crushing many inhabitants. When the party draws close, six of the corpses animate
  as[monsters]Wight;Wights[/monsters]. Once awoken, the wights fight any living creatures they see.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>5: Hideout.</em></strong> Beauregard Baxton’s brother Brandon has been transformed
  into a <strong>[monsters]Yeti[/monsters].</strong> He escaped and hid here, unsure what to do. He
  pretends to be a fierce creature if discovered but responds positively if the characters try to
  talk to him. Brandon doesn’t remember much from before his transformation, but he’s eager to find
  his family and protect them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>6: Ruins.</em></strong> A human forester named Wila Peat was captured by Letha and
  turned into a <strong>[monsters]Cyclops Sentry[/monsters].</strong> Letha told Wila to go find
  more subjects for transmutation, and Wila agreed out of fear. Wila is Indifferent to the
  characters. As an [action]Influence[/action] action, a creature can try to convince her to turn
  against Letha and make a DC 15 Charisma ([skill]Persuasion[/skill]) check, earning Wila’s support
  on a successful check. A character who promises to turn Wila back into a human has Advantage on
  this check.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>7: Guard Room.</em></strong> Three of Letha’s followers, now transformed into a
  [monsters]Chimera[/monsters], a [monsters]Drider[/monsters], and a [monsters]Medusa[/monsters]
  respectively, guard the temple and await Letha’s orders.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>8: Transmutation Chamber.</em></strong> Once a day, a character outside the
  transmutation chamber can take the [action]Magic[/action] action to activate it and shape-shift a
  Humanoid or Beast inside the chamber into a creature of another type. (On the day the party
  arrives, the chamber hasn’t been used.) The new form is chosen by the DM. The target’s game
  statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen creature, but the target retains its
  alignment and personality.
</p>
<p>
  The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form; if the new
  form can’t speak, for example, the target can’t speak either and can’t use Verbal components.
</p>
<p>When the target shape-shifts, its equipment drops to the ground.</p>
<p>
  Casting the [spells]Remove Curse[/spells] spell on a creature shape-shifted this way restores it
  to its original form. The effect also ends if the creature dies. Once a creature has been affected
  by the transmutation chamber, the chamber doesn’t work on it again.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>9: Letha’s Lair.</em></strong> Letha has transformed herself into a
  <strong>[monsters]Young Blue Dragon[/monsters].</strong> If she’s not using the transmutation
  chamber on another victim, she’s here, trying to figure out how to better control the chamber or
  plotting her takeover of the Dalelands.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>10: Fey Annex.</em></strong> Only Fey creatures can pass through the archway entrance
  to this part of the temple. A [monsters]Dire Worg[/monsters], preserved in magical suspended
  animation since the glory days of <a href="#MythDrannor2">Myth Drannor</a>, sleeps in the chamber.
  It awakens if touched or if it takes damage.
</p>
