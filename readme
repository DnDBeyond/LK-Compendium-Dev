To set up a project:

Duplicate /Sheets/Compendium/_template
Rename child files accordingly


To preview work
open generic-compendium-test.html
Ctrl+F search for "Add CSS" and find the style code:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./Compendium/[project name]/[file name].css">
Fill in the snippet to target your css (NOT the scss). eg:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./Compendium/Wheat/Chapter2.css">

Ctrl+F serach for "Add HTML" and find the HTMLpath variable: 
const HTMLPath = "./Compendium/[project]/[file name].html";
Replace the variable with your target HTML, eg:
const HTMLPath = "./Compendium/Wheat/Chapter2.html";

Save all files.

Be sure your SASS live watcher compiles your scss into a css file!
